ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – The sound of song filled the oldest AME church in St. Louis on Thursday, just one day after the sound of gunfire filled the oldest AME church in the south.


A diverse group of people gathered to mourn the nine victims of last night’s mass shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston South Carolina.


The gathering at St. Paul AME Church was organized. It included singing and a message of hope for a world free of violence.

“I think coming together in community always helps because you realize that you are not alone one who is suffering the only one who is hurting,” Rev, Karen Anderson said.


The African Methodist Episcopal church was formed in response to racial discrimination. AME churches have long been a target of hate crimes. The faith leaders at the gathering said the shooting is a clear sign that more needs to be done to address mental health, gun violence and racism.
