ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI)-A national research group says St. Louis County’s fragmented policing is hurting the region in many ways. 
A report by the Washington based Police Executive Research Forum, or PERF
, says it found an unusual practice in North County that is not seen in other areas of the country and that is the focus on raising revenue by writing traffic tickets and citations.

The report recommends that 18 small north St. Louis County police departments be taken over by St. Louis County police or University City police to cut waste and improve strained relations with residents.


The PERF Report also recommends one police academy for St. Louis city and county. It says one academy would educate all officers to the same standards which would improve the quality of police services.


The report was commissioned by Better Together, a St. Louis group studying the benefits of regional cooperation.
