Fourth suspect in custody in Central West End police shooting






 






ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – A fourth person tied to the shooting of a St. Louis police officer in the Central West End turned himself over to authorities on Thursday, but for a different set of crimes.


The St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office charged 23-year-old Aaron Collins with first-degree robbery, first-degree assault, and two counts of armed criminal action in an unrelated case.


Prosecutors said Collins and an accomplice attempted to rob a man at gunpoint at an apartment complex in the 3400 block of Hamilton around 11 a.m. When the intended victim refused to hand over his property, Collins allegedly shot the man in the leg. Collins and his accomplice went through the victim’s pockets and stolen approximately $300.


Collins is believed to have been sitting in the backseat of the vehicle used in the shooting of the St. Louis police officer. He has not yet been charged in that case.


Earlier Thursday, St. Louis police 
arrested the suspected shooter
