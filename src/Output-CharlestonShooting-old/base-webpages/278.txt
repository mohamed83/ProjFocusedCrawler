DELLWOOD, MO – St. Louis County Police have released more video of looters hitting the Dellwood Mobil Mart on April 29th.  They are looking for the public’s help to identify the 32 suspects captured on the store’s surveillance camera.


FOX 2 obtained the footage from store owners on April 29th
. It shows looters throwing a rock through the front door of the business about 1:40am. Owner Phil Hurlbut says this is the third time the store has been looted since the Michael Brown shooting.
