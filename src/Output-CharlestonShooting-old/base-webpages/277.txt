ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – A three-year-old boy is in critical but stable condition at St. Louis Children`s Hospital, clinging to life after accidentally shooting himself in the head with a gun he found in a bedroom at his North St. Louis home.


St. Louis police got a call at about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning saying a child had been shot in the forehead in a two-family house in the 1200 block of Walton.


Police were quickly able to determine it was accidental and self-inflicted.


The child was hit by one bullet fired from a semi-automatic handgun.


The boy`s mother and at least three other adults were in the home when the gun went off but none was in the room with the child when it happened.


‘It was at a low enough position that the child could actually reach it,’ said St. Louis Police Capt. Michael Sack. ‘At three years old they can walk around and reach up to point. It was just accessible inside that back bedroom.’


Police say they have a 24 year-old-suspect in custody but no charges have been filed.


Police removed five guns from the home and led two men, said to be family members, away in handcuffs for questioning.
