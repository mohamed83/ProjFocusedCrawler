Ferguson shooting’s witness denied bond-reduction request

ST. LOUIS (AP) _ A judge has refused to lower the bond of a key witness of the Michael Brown shooting death who is accused of resisting arrest during a recent confrontation with police.


St. Louis Associate Circuit Judge Michael Noble denied a defense request to reduce the $1,000 cash-only bond for 23-year-old Dorian Johnson.


Johnson was charged last week with resisting arrest or interfering with a lawful stop or detention. He’s accused of trying to hinder the arrest of his younger brother the previous day.


Johnson was a prominent witness of the shooting death last August of Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old who was killed by white Ferguson officer Darren Wilson during a confrontation in a street. Brown’ death led to sometimes-violent protests in Ferguson and other U.S. cities.
