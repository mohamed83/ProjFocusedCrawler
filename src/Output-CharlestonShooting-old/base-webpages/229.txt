ST. LOUIS (KTVI)- The St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office Wednesday formally charged the man authorities say drove a suspect wanted for shooting a St. Louis police officer away from the scene Tuesday morning.


Edward Davis, 27, of St. Louis, was charged with Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer and Armed Criminal Action. Authorities say a police Sergeant, in full uniform and sitting in his own car along Maryland Plaza in the Central West End early Tuesday morning, was approached by several men and later by a vehicle when a male suspect got out of the car and fired shots.


The shooter fled on foot, but the probable cause statement released by prosecutors late Wednesday says Davis admitted to driving the car and was found with keys to that vehicle.


The police Sergeant returned fire and was later treated and released from an area hospital.
