Anderson police seek shooting suspect






 






ANDERSON, Ind. (Aug. 15, 2015)–Anderson Police are seeking a suspect they believe shot a man and left him lying in the street.


Anderson Police investigators have identified 18-year-old Malik Montgomery as the primary suspect in shooting incident Saturday afternoon.


Shortly before 4:30 p.m., Anderson Police were called to the 1800 block of West 9th Street on the report of multiple gunshots in the area.


Police found shell casings and broken auto glass.  They had what appeared to be a crime scene, but those involved had already fled.


A short time later officers were sent to the 2600 block of Horton Drive where they found Christopher  A. McCord lying in the street suffering from a gunshot wound to his right hip.


McCord was taken to St. Vincent Hospital Anderson and then was flown to St. Vincent’s Indianapolis by medical helicopter.


Police believe the two men may have been taking part in a pre-arranged fight that ended in gunfire.


Investigators say they want to talk to Montgomery in relation to the shooting.  Police say he should be considered armed and dangerous and should not be approached by the public.


Anyone with information about the incident or Montgomery’s whereabouts is asked to call Anderson Police at (765) 648-6930.
