Indianapolis Metro Police investigating fatal shooting on near west side.






 






INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (Aug. 1, 2015) — Detectives with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) are looking for the person who shot and killed a man. Just after 1 p.m. Saturday, police responded to the 700 block of North Lynn Street on the near west side, which is where the shooting happened. Myers’ family says he was a 40-year-old father of two, ages six and 13. One of his children showed up to the spot where her father was killed and broke down in tears. Upset, as well, are his friends.


“Too much violence, it ain’t really nothing new though, it ain’t really nothing new. It’s been going on,” said Darius Johnson, upset about the death of his friend. “He don’t bother nobody or nothing like that. Wrong place, wrong time.”


Myers was shot a number of times, found by police inside of a car. Detectives heard from witnesses that Myers was involved in some type of argument with two other people just before he was killed.


“Our victim was shot multiple times in his upper torso and died here on the scene. Two black males were last seen fleeing in a vehicle southbound on North Lynn Street,” said Lieutenant Richard Riddle.


The area where this happened is known to police.


“We’ve had a couple of known incidents of shots fired and we had a homicide about a month ago in this same block,” Lt. Riddle added.


If you have any information that could help solve this, you asked to call IMPD or Central Indiana Crime Stoppers at 317-262-TIPS (8477).
