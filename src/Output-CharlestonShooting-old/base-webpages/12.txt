KINGS MOUNTAIN, N.C. (June 18, 2015) — The woman who spotted the car driven by the suspect in 
Wednesday night’s church shootings
 in Charleston, South Carolina, says God brought him to her attention.


Debbie Dills says she was on her way to work in North Carolina, singing and praying for the nine people who were killed, when she thought she recognized the car and driver she’d seen on the news.


She called her boss, who contacted police and then stayed in contact with her as she followed the suspect. Police responded quickly and 
arrested 21-year-old Dylann Roof
.


Dills says the Lord “knew he needed to be caught” and she’s sure that “it was divine intervention.”
