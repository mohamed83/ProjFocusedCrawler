Hearing set for man accused of Ferguson protest shooting






 






CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) _ A preliminary hearing is scheduled for next month for a man accused of shooting two police officers during a Ferguson demonstration.


Twenty-year-old Jeffrey L. Williams made a brief St. Louis County Circuit Court appearance Tuesday on charges of felony assault, armed criminal action and a weapons offense. A judge scheduled Williams’ preliminary hearing for June 9.


Williams is accused of wounding the officers on March 12, during an early-morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson’s police chief. Both officers survived.


Prosecutors say Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else. Williams’ attorney has countered that Williams was beaten by police into wrongly confessing.


Williams remains jailed on $300,000 cash bond.
