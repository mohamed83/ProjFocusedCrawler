ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) – A wild night shakes up a usually quiet neighborhood in University City. A home invasion, running from police, smashing into parked cars and fleeing the scene. Those are just some of the crimes the two men could be charged with.


It began on Belrue around 3:20am. A woman confronted two men who invaded her home.


“She screamed and they fled the residence.” said Capt. Michael Ransom.


Police arrived in a minute and the suspects drove their stolen Accura head long into a police cruiser. The officer suffered minor injures.


“I heard the crash. It was a large and it was cars being run into. Then I heard 8 gun shots, pow pow pow pow.” said resident Clint Gholston.


Next the suspects crashed into these two vehicles. Police ordered them to get out of the car, they refused.


“The driver revved the engine accelerated back toward the officers. The officers fired at the vehicle.” said Capt. Ransom.


The Accura took off and was not seen again until late this afternoon. The stolen vehicle was discovered Friday afternoon behind an apartment building in St. Louis City. It was full of holes and broken windows. Police had fired twenty shots.


“I hope they get them and punish them and so others will know were not going to be tolerating this behavior in U City. It is predominantly a nice place to live.” said neighbor Edna Sayles.


Edward McDanile wants to know who`s going to pay for his two damaged cars. “I was shocked, frustrated because they runined the cars.”

Police are still looking for the two men who were wearing red shirts. It`s not known if they were hit by any of the flying bullets or flying glass.
