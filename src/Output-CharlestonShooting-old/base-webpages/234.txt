CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) _ The man accused of shooting two police officers during a protest in Ferguson is slated to appear in court.


Twenty-year-old Jeffrey L. Williams is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday on charges of felony assault, armed criminal action and a weapons offense.


Williams is accused of wounding a St. Louis County officer and a Webster Groves officer on March 12 during an early morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson’s police chief. Both officers survived.


The demonstration that night was sparked by the resignation of then Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson. The protest was on the verge of breaking up when the shots suddenly rang out.


Prosecutors say Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else. Williams’ attorney has countered that Williams was beaten by police into wrongly confessing, an allegation police deny.


A county police spokesperson says the county officer has returned to work in a limited capacity but won`t be back to full duty until august at the earliest.


The Webster Groves officer is not back at work though authorities have said a full recovery is expected.


Williams is jailed on $300,000 cash bond.
