GLASGLOW VILLAGE, MO(KTVI) – An attempt to deliver eviction papers went awry, leading to the shooting of two dogs, and the SWAT Team responding to the scene. It began just before 10 o’clock Wednesday morning, when a sheriff’s deputy arrived at a home on Hobkirk in Glasgow Village, to serve an eviction notice.

When the deputy approached the home, he says the resident released his pit bulls, who came charging toward him. The deputy shot both dogs in the face. Then police say the resident, 32 year-old Will Berkley, threatened to kill the deputy.


St. Louis County Police Sgt. Brian Schellman says, “The sheriff calls in St. Louis County Police. Our 1st Precinct officers arrive to contain the house and talk with the man. They did that for some time, a little over an hour, and when the man was uncooperative, they made the decision to call Tactical Operations.”


Armored vehicles sat in front of the home, and on nearby Shepley Drive. Just after noon, 32 year-old Will Berkley peacefully came out with his hands up.


After he was hauled away in handcuffs, FOX 2 caught up with his father and girlfriend.


“I never thought it would escalate to this. No, it should never,” says his father, Bill Berkley. It turns out that Will’s father owns the home, and his son had been behind on rent. He explains, “I wanted to have him served, to show him I was real about hey, you need to keep up your rent, and that’s basically it. They weren’t supposed to come over here and shoot his dogs.”


Will Berkley’s girlfriend, Misty Bell, was inside the home when the deputy walked up. She says Will was just letting the dogs out, and didn’t see the deputy coming: “We had just gotten up. I was still laying in bed. He had let the dogs out to go to the bathroom. I heard two gun shots go off. I got up and he was running outside, and the dogs come up with blood pouring out of their face.”


The dogs, named Gotti and Cain, were taken by Animal Control. Will’s father says they’re nice dogs, and the whole situation got out of hand. He says, “They’ll come up here, tails wagging. They’re excited. Somebody coming up to see them, basically.”


At last check, the dogs are in stable condition, but need to be transferred for treatment. Unrelated to the eviction notice, police say Berkley also has an active warrant against him, for unlawful use of a weapon.
