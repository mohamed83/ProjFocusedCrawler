CHARLESTON, S.C. -- A white man opened fire during a prayer meeting inside a historic black church in downtown Charleston, killing nine people, including the pastor, in an assault that authorities describe as a hate crime.
Authorities have identified the shooting suspect as 21-year-old Dylann Roof
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen says Roof attended the meeting at the church last night and stayed for nearly an hour before the shootings.
Mullen says the victims were six females and three males.
State House Minority leader Todd Rutherford tells The Associated Press that the Emanuel AME Church's pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, was among those killed.
The shooter remains at large. Police released photographs from surveillance video of Roof and a possible getaway vehicle.
The 41-year-old Pinckney was a married father of two who was elected to the state House at age 23, making him the youngest member of the House at the time.
Roof is described as a white man thought to be in his early 20s. Mullen said he had no reason to think Roof has left the Charleston area, but is distributing information about the suspect and the vehicle around the country.
Mullen says the suspect is a "very dangerous individual." Mullen urged people to call police about Roof and not pursue him or his vehicle on their own.
Mullen said police consider the shooting a hate crime. The FBI and state police are helping in the search.

Mullen did not give other details about the victims. He says names will not be released until families are notified.
Earlier, Mullen said he had no reason to think the suspect has left the Charleston area, but is distributing information about the suspect and the vehicle around the country.
Police say the gunman sat in a meeting at the church for about an hour before shooting the 9 victims.
