INDIANAPOLIS (July 20, 2015) – Indianapolis Metropolitan police are investigating after a double shooting on the near east side Monday morning. They said a man wore a wig and dress to ambush his girlfriend and her brother.


The shooting was reported around 9:40 a.m. in the 300 block of Eastern Avenue in the area of New York and Rural streets. The shooting victims were loading some children into an SUV to go to daycare when the shooting happened.

Both shooting victims were taken to Eskenazi Hospital in critical condition. The woman had been shot multiple times, police said, while the man had been shot once. No one else was hurt during the shooting. Family members identified the victims as Sultanna Reed and Zach Guyton.


“I think it’s horrible, especially with babies in car,” said neighbor Yvette Armstrong. “They’re going to be traumatized for the rest of their lives seeing mom shot like that.”


Hearing the gunfire, Armstrong ran to help and grabbed a three-year-old child out of the car covered in blood. Then, Armstrong tried to keep the victim alert and alive.


“She was in and out and every now and then she was shaking,” said Armstrong. “I told her to blink her eyes to stay with me.”


Police said a suspect was detained in the 4300 block of Audubon. They found the disguise discarded in the trash nearby. The shooting was the result of an ongoing domestic situation between the two parties, investigators said.


Around 4 p.m., IMPD announced that Michael Love, 56, was arrested in connection with the shooting. Love has been preliminarily charged with two counts of aggravated battery and one count of criminal recklessness. Police say the investigation is ongoing.

“I think it’s crazy. I think it’s barbaric. Why do you play God when somebody doesn’t want to be with you? Let it go,” said the victim’s cousin Aisha Owens-Rashid, Guyton’s cousin. She says Love and Reed have a child together.


Court records show Reed had a protective order filed against her for allegedly trying to run over the ex-boyfriend with a car.


Since that dispute, Reed’s family says the boyfriend has continued to threaten the victim’s life.


“He told her if she was with another man he was going to kill her,” said Owens-Rashid.


Anyone with information should call Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at (317) 262-TIPS (8477). Callers may also text “INDYCS” plus tip information to 274637 (CRIMES).
