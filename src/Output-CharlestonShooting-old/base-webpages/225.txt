FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) _ A yearly festival in Ferguson that was postponed last summer in the wake of the police shooting death there of Michael Brown is gearing up to return this weekend.


The 
St. Louis Post-Dispatch
 reports that the St. Louis suburb’s StreetFest is scheduled to take place from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday. That’s the same day city launches the Ferguson Farmers Market summer season.


The event will include food sales and specialty vendors, a morning workout class, relay races, karaoke, children’s activities, and bands performing throughout the day with the Soulard Blues Band as the headliner.


The festival was to have taken place last September but was put off because of unrest that followed the Aug. 9 shooting death of 18-year-old Brown by a white Ferguson police officer.
