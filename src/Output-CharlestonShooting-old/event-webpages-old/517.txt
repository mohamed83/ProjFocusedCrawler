Police Investigating Two South Sac Liquor Store Robberies


 


SOUTH SACRAMENTO —
Officers are investigating two South Sacramento liquor store armed robberies which took place within ten minutes of each other on Franklin Blvd.
Around 6:30 p.m., sheriffs received a call from Star Liquor reporting the owner had just been shot by one of two black male suspects during a robbery of the store.
The owner suffered a non-life threatening injury to his arm and was taken to a hospital for treatment.
Ten minutes later, police received another call, this time from an employee at Port Liquor. The employee reported the store was just robbed by about 6-7 black males who came in, showed off a handgun and took items from the store.
Within minutes, a Sheriff’s helicopter pilot spotted two black males walking over the footbridge on Franklin Blvd. over Highway 99. The two were wearing clothing similar to the descriptions provided by the witnesses of each robbery.
As the helicopter stayed over the two, they began to run. Field units were eventually able to apprehend the two and recover a handgun.
This is an ongoing investigation. FOX40 will continue to provide updates as they become available.
