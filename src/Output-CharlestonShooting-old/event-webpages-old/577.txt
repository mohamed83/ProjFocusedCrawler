Police say a man demanded money from a teller at about 12:43 p.m. Tuesday. He indicated he had a weapon, but the employee did not actually see it. However, she feared for her safety and complied with the man’s demands.
After grabbing the money, he took off.
No one was injured during the robbery.
There’s no word on how much money the suspect got away with.
The suspect is described as a black male, about 40 years old, 6-feet-five-inches tall with an athletic build. He has short dark hair and was last seen wearing a white shirt with squared patterns, blue jeans and black shoes.
The FBI believes the person responsible for Tuesday’s robbery is connected to a series of bank robberies in the Bay Area.  The suspect in the Bay Area robberies has been identified as 48-year-old Darius Gilbert.
Gilbert has an active felony warrant out of San Francisco for his arrest and should be considered armed and dangerous.
Anyone with information regarding this robbery is asked to call the Elk Grove Police Department Detective Bureau at (916) 478-8060 or Crime Alert at (916) 443-HELP (4357).  Callers to Crime Alert can remain anonymous and may be eligible for a reward of up to $1,000.
