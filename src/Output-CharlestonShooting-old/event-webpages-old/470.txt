ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – Three men are facing charges Wednesday night for leading police on a high-speed chase into Illinois and Missouri Tuesday afternoon. Aubrey Watkins, Eric Hayes and Kevon Hayes are facing resisting arrest charges.
Police say the three men were in a car that lead police on a chase from south St. Louis city into South St. County, over the Jefferson Barracks Bridge into Illinois and then back into downtown over the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge.
Police say they began following the car because they thought a robbery suspect was inside.
All of the suspects were arrested in downtown St. Louis, but the robbery suspect is still at-large.
