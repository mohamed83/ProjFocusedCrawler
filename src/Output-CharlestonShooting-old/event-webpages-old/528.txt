Suspect Is Returned to Charleston 
Dylann Storm Roof waived extradition and was flown to South Carolina aboard a private plane Thursday evening and, amid extraordinary security, walked into the jail in Charleston County at 7:25 p.m. 
As Mr. Roof, who was wearing a striped jail jumpsuit, entered the jail through a secured entrance, a police dog barked, cameras clicked and one woman uttered an epithet.
Nearby, a 15-year-old boy from North Charleston held a handwritten sign: “Your evildoing did not break our community! You made us stronger!”
The boy, Hikaym Rivers, said that he doubted Mr. Roof saw his message — and he questioned whether the suspect would have cared if he noticed the sign — but he said it was important to make a public statement one night after the shooting in Charleston.
“We’re supporting our community, and we’re taking a stand that no one can just take this away from us,” he said. “It’s our peace of mind.”
Jail officials said that Mr. Roof would make a court appearance on Friday afternoon.
