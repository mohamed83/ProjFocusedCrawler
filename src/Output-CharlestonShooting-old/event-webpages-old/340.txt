FERGUSON, MO (KTVI) – There are still no arrests Friday morning in connection with the shooting of two police officers outside the Ferguson Police Department.
A spokesman with the St Louis County Police Department says detectives are still chasing down leads and have talked with several people in connection with the shooting of the officers. However, the spokesman would not give an exact number of how many people have been questioned.
At present, concrete barricades are now blocking parts of the main driveway entrance to the police department, but the barricades did not stop people from coming out to the area.
Thursday night around 8 p.m., there was a multi-faith candlelight vigil near the Ferguson Police Department. People prayed for the St. Louis County police officer and the Webster Groves officer who were shot outside the police department early Thursday morning.
They also talked about non-violent ways to achieve change and justice. Following the vigil, members of that group joined others in demonstrations outside the police department. County police estimate there were about 70 protesters out in the area last night.
There were also county police and Missouri Highway Patrol troopers on-hand. Those two agencies have taken over security in this area.
Protesters went home about 11:30 p.m., according to authorities. No arrests were made. No violence occurred in this latest round of demonstrations.
