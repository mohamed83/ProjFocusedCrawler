ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – St. Louis homicide detectives are working a fatal double shooting that occurred on Fairview Ave. near Roger Place Sunday morning around 11 am.  Police say officers called to the scene found a female and male unconscious and not breathing. Both victims suffered from gunshot wounds.  They have been identified as 42-year-old Tanisha Williams and 39-year-old Arvel Long.
“This appears to be a murder suicide,” said Lt. John Green, St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.  “But it’s early in the investigation.”
Nearby residents reported hearing gunshots after midnight Friday, but were uncertain from what direction the gunshots came from.  Some neighbors heard loud arguing Friday night and tried to check on Williams, but were unable to reach her Friday or Saturday.
Lt. John Green, Commander of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department said the shootings appear to be the result of a murder suicide.  He said a gun was recovered at the scene.  Investigators say a bullet hole in a window indicates the shot came from where the bodies were found.
Police also say relatives of the victims have been trying to contact the two victims the past two days.
An investigation is ongoing.
