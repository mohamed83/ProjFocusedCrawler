ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – A police pursuit traveled through the Bi-State area Tuesday afternoon and ended at a big downtown St. Louis hotel.
It began on South Interstate 55 at Germania. The suspects’ vehicle weaved in and out of traffic on the highways sometimes even getting on the shoulder to pass big rigs.
Detectives believed there were a number of suspects inside the Dodge Charger, one a robbery suspect, the others believed to be armed and carrying drugs.
It’s estimated the car was traveling well over 100 miles per hour. Cops tried but failed to use spike strips to stop the vehicle.
The pursuit went into South County where one suspect bailed out. The Dodge traveled into Illinois. Police on the ground stopped pursing but the police helicopter followed from the air. The Dodge traveled back into St. Louis where it all ended at the Hyatt Hotel garage. Police drew their guns. The suspect made a run for it out the back of the garage but he was quickly caught and brought down by cops not far from hotel guests. Meghan Orville is a hotel guest. She said, “Pretty surprising to be honest.”  Hotel Guest Chetavua Bell added, “It’s unbelievable we were actually on our way to get our car we just stumbled upon this we were amazed like what did we walk into.”
The suspects’ vehicle’s windows were broken.
Besides the man arrested at the hotel, three other suspects were rounded up at Broadway and North Market. The robbery suspect has not been caught.
