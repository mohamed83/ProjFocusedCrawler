FOLSOM-
Police have arrested a second suspect in connection with the shooting of a 30-year-old man in Folsom.
Greg Ashman, 27, of El Dorado Hills, was arrested Wednesday in Reno, Nevada.
Officers with the Folsom Police Department responded to reports of a shooting on Sutter Street near Scott Street at 12:45 a.m. on Easter Sunday.
