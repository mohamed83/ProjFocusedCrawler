CHARLESTON, SC — Police in Charleston say the suspect in a fatal church shooting at a historic black church is charged with nine counts of murder as well as possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.
Police spokesman Charles Francis said Friday that 21-one-year-old Dylann Roof is charged with the 10 total counts in the Wednesday night fatal church shooting.
A bond hearing is scheduled for 2 p.m. Friday.
Nine people were killed in the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston. Officials are investigating it as a hate crime. Police say Roof spent nearly an hour at the church in a prayer meeting before shooting the victims.
