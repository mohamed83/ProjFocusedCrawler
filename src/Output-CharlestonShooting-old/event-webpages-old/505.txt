Shooting wounds two in north St. Louis Saturday night


 


ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI)-Police are investigating a double shooting late Saturday night in north St. Louis. Police say it happened around 10:30pm on Bessie Court and Marcus.
According to police, a 19-year-old male and a 16-year-old female were driving east on Bessie when a car heading west almost hit them. The cars parked at the 16-year-old’s  home and an argument ensued.  Hearing the fighting, the parents of the 16-year-old came out of their house. That’s when the suspect pulled out a gun and fired several shots.
The 19-year-old was shot in the hip and the 55-year-old mother was shot in the leg. Both victims were taken to a hospital in stable condition.
The suspect is the 18-year-old neighbor of one of the victims and is wanted by police.
