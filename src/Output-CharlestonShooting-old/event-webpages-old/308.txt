ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – St. Louis police officers are using K-9’s Tuesday night to sniff out three suspected car thieves in South St. Louis. Police say officers noticed a car driving erratically and ran the license plate, discovering the vehicle had been stolen earlier today from the Shaw neighborhood.
The vehicle struck a police cruiser near a Home Depot on South Kingshighway. The suspects crashed the vehicle later near Kingshighway and Tholozan. The three suspects exited the car and fled on foot.
It’s believed one suspects may have a serious injury to an arm.
