Police chase ends with officer hospitalized, suspect behind bars


 


WEST VALLEY CITY — Police arrested a suspect after a brief chase in West Valley City Thursday night.
According to West Valley City police, it started when the Metro Gang Unit recognized the suspect and contacted WVCPD for assistance in arresting him.
“Our patrol car attempted to stop the suspect. They didn’t pull right over. They pulled into the neighhorhood. When they did pull over, both the driver and the suspect fled from the vehicle,” said Lt. Dalan Taylor, West Valley City Police Department. “A short foot pursuit ensued and officers were able to track down both of the suspects.”
At one point during the pursuit, an officer from the Unified Police Department was involved in an accident.
“When the suspects fled, there was actually three or four patrol cars that were here. One of the Unified officers backed up to head around the corner to head the suspect off, didn’t see a vehicle which was stopped behind him at a stop sign and backed into that car,” Taylor said.”There’s […] a complaint of minor injuries in the vehicle that got hit and that Unified officer did end up going to the hospital with some minor injuries.”
Police arrested Richard Trujillo in connection with the incident.
Trujillo faces charges of possession of amphetamine, failure to stop at the command of a law enforcement officer, possession of drug paraphernalia, distribution of a controlled substance, possessing or receiving stolen property and fleeing.

Hopefully they’ll throw the book at this drug dealing puke.  There is no place for Mr. Trujillo in decent society.
