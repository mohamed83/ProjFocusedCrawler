The Daily Show opened on Thursday night with a powerful monologue from host Stewart slamming the deaths in Charleston and the culture that seeks to deny that racism is behind such attacks. Before introducing his guest – Nobel peace prize-winner Malala Yousafzai – Stewart said his show would contain no jokes tonight in the wake of the Charleston massacre.
