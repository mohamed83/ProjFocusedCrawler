EAST ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – The Illinois State Police Department is looking into whether a shooting at the Deshields Housing Complex in East St. Louis was justified.
A man was shot in the leg by an East St. Louis Housing Authority Officer Saturday afternoon.
Housing Authority Officers are not police officers, but they have the authority to carry a firearm, make arrests and use deadly force when necessary.
Around 1 p.m., East St. Louis Housing Authority got a tip from a resident that some burglary suspects were in a home at the housing complex.
Three officers arrived moments later and there was a confrontation outside the home. That’s when one of the housing authority officers opened fire.
A resident who told FOX 2’s Anthony Kiekow that she called in the tip said that the man who was shot was not one of the burglary suspects.
The investigation is ongoing.
The man who was shot was listed in stable condition Saturday night.
