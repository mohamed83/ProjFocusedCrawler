MODESTO —
First Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in Modesto, cousin church to Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, held a service and released balloons Sunday in honor of the nine lives taken by a gunman Wednesday.
Pastor Victor Travis and his wife, Jasiman, coordinated the event in hopes of bringing together people from all backgrounds and spreading love and unity.
“It’s just something I felt needed to happen to get the community involved and to get everyone to come together,” said Jasiman Travis.
Nearly 75 people crowded in front of the church to participate in songs, prayers and preaching the message of forgiveness in light of the tragedy.
Pastor Travis said he got calls from Caucasian congregations asking if they could attend the event as they were unsure if they should come.
He welcomed everyone with open arms and said putting aside differences and ​coming together is how he wants to work towards avoiding anymore situations like the one in South Carolina.
