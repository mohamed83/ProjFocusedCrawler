ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) – Police are hoping surveillance video will lead to an arrest in a deadly shooting that happened downtown Friday. Investigators say the man in the video shot and killed 26-year-old Michael Jackson following an argument near the City Museum Friday afternoon.
After the shooting, the suspect got into a white vehicle, believed to be a Ford Focus, and drove away.
Police say the suspected gunman is 5’ 10″ with a thin build and long braids pulled into a bun. He was wearing a red, white and blue jacket and light colored pants.
