ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – it was an active Monday for St. Louis County and St. Charles city police. They’re looking for 3 robbery suspects who hit two payday loan stores.
First up was the Missouri Payday Loan Office on Capital Drive in St. Charles at 10 am. That’s when a man walked in, demanded money and assaulted the cashiers.
Then less than 10 minutes later a shocking scene inside of the CashAmerica at the 7900 block of St. Charles Rock Road. Police release video of two men robbing the store, one of them armed with a shotgun. The men took cash and jewelry then ran on foot towards Hanley Road.
Police say the crimes had similar targets, but the methods were drastically different and not connected. At this point, the doors at CashAmerica are closed for now and there’s no word on when those doors will reopen.
