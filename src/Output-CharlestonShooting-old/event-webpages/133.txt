 Dylann Roof, the man accused of gunning down nine parishioners at a historically black church in Charleston, was charged on Friday with nine counts of murder and illegal weapons possession, police said.  


 Roof, 21, confessed on Thursday to perpetrating the horrific attack at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston, two sources confirmed to NBC News. 


 Roof told police that he "almost didn't go through with it because everyone was so nice to him," sources told NBC News — but he decided he had to "go through with his mission."

 Roof 
was captured
 in Shelby, North Carolina, on Thursday morning during a traffic stop. He agreed to be taken back to South Carolina. 


 He was being held Friday at the Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston. A sheriff's spokesman told NBC News that Roof's cell at the detention facility neighbored that of Michael Slager, the white South Carolina officer charged with murder for shooting Walter Scott, an unarmed black man. 


 Police have called the killings a hate crime, and the Justice Department will open a civil rights investigation that will parallel the state probe.

 South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley 
told TODAY
 that she believes Roof committed a hate crime and should pay the ultimate price. 


 "We will absolutely want him to have the death penalty," Haley said.

 Roof was among a dozen church members who were attending a Bible study at Emanuel AME, one of the nation's oldest African-American churches. He asked to sit next to the pastor, and about an hour into the meeting, opened fire on the people there. He killed six women and three men, including the pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, police said. Three people survived.

 One survivor told a relative of Pinckney's that during the rampage the gunman said that African-Americans are "taking over our country."

South Carolina church fire: Mt. Zion AME burns in Greeleyville

(CNN) — A fire broke out at the Mt. Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church in Greeleyville, South Carolina, on Tuesday. Up to 50 firefighters fought to extinguish the blaze, a fire official said.
As yet, authorities do not know what caused it, said Williamsburg County Fire Chief Randy Swinton.
The local sheriff, local police and the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division have also responded to the fire at the traditionally black church.
The FBI and five agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is also investigating, said ATF Special Agent Tom Mangan.
“Anytime there is a house of worship involved in a fire, ATF is automatically assigned to look into the cause,” he said.
A sniffer dog will likely be sent in during the first phase of the investigation, once the embers cool down, said Nero Priester, an ATF arson specialist. That could be as early as Wednesday afternoon.
The church’s brick walls were still standing early Wednesday, but the flames gutted the entire interior, fire officials told CNN affiliate WCIV.
Previous hate crime
The church’s previous structure burned in 1995 as a result of hate-motivated arson during a spate of about 30 fires that swept black churches in Southern states at the time. Members of the Ku Klux Klan were responsible for that attack, Mangan said.
Then President Bill Clinton spoke at the new church structure in 1996 days before its official dedication to call for racial unity in the United States.
Greeleyville is small town in rural Williamsburg County in the eastern part of the state.
Senior Bishop John Bryant of AME’s national headquarters said Tuesday night’s fire “will not send us into despair or depression. As Christians, we are a people of resurrection and even from the ashes we will rise.”
Other fires
A racially motivated shooting in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston earlier this month triggered an outpouring sympathy and outrage throughout the country.
Since that shooting, at least six black churches have burned in the southeastern United States. Investigators have said that there has been no evidence these were hate crimes, nor that they were linked. Two of them may have been the result of arson.
Since the Charleston shooting, the most recent religious targets of hate crimes have been Jewish synagogues and Islamic mosques, the Southern Poverty Law Center said.

 Charleston County Coroner Rae Wilson said Thursday that the gunman walked into the church and didn't raise any red flags among the worshipers. 


 "The suspect entered the group and was accepted by them, as they believed that he wanted to join them in this Bible study," she said. Then, "he became very aggressive and violent."

 Roof had 
two prior arrests earlier this year
 after he was stopped at a Columbia shopping mall and was found with Suboxone, a type of narcotic used to treat opiate addictions, police reports show. He was taken into custody on a drug charge, and then again the following month for trespassing at the mall. 


 Roof's uncle told Reuters that he had received a .45-caliber handgun from his father for his birthday in April, but officials have not said how he got the firearm used in the shooting or its make.
