Charleston shootings: White man kills nine after opening fire on people praying inside church

A white man has opened fire on people praying inside a historic black church, killing nine people, in what has been described as a hate crime.
The man, who is believed to be in his early 20s, was said to still be at large last night.
The shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston was carried out last night as the people inside took part in a prayer meeting, police said.
There are believed to be survivors, but it is not known how many, or how many were inside at the time of the shooting.

It was unknown whether the pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, was one of the victims.
Police Chief Greg Mullen said believed it was a hate crime, but would not elaborate.
‘The only reason that someone could walk into a church and shoot people praying is out of hate,’ said Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley. ‘It is the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine, and we will bring that person to justice. … This is one hateful person.’

As police and the city’s mayor updated the news media, a group of pastors huddled together praying in a circle across the street.
Police moved members of the news media back away from the site due to what they called an ‘imminent’ threat. They did not release any details.
The campaign of Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush sent out an email saying that due to the shooting, the candidate had canceled an event planned in the city Thursday.
The Emmanuel AME church is a historic African-American church that traces its roots to 1816, when several churches split from Charleston’s Methodist Episcopal church.
One of its founders, Denmark Vesey, tried to organize a slave revolt in 1822. He was caught, and white landowners had his church burned in revenge. Parishioners worshipped underground until after the Civil War.
