LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) —
Authorities say a Long Beach police officer is expected to recover after being shot and wounded along with a suspect during an exchange of gunfire at an apartment complex.
Officer Claudia Lopez says officers responded late Sunday to unspecified reports of trouble in the residential area of north Long Beach.
Lopez says when officers arrived at the complex, the suspect opened fire. She says officers returned fire and one officer and the gunman were wounded.
They were each hospitalized in stable condition. Lopez says the officer’s injuries are not considered to be life-threatening.
No names have been released.
The incident is under investigation.
