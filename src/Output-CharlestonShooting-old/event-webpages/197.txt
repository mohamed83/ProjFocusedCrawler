Is the Confederate flag a racist symbol? After Charleston, the debate rages on


For most Americans, the answer is simple: yes. But the flag has its defenders who insist it expresses a rich southern heritage, not hatred associated with slavery

CICERO, Ill. (STMW)
 — A police officer in Cicero shot a suspected gang member fleeing from police Thursday evening in the western suburb.


Police responded Thursday evening to a report of a street gang fight at 13th Street and 56th Court in Cicero and the gang members “scattered” and police gave chase, Cicero spokesman Ray Hanania said in a statement.


One of the fleeing gang members encountered a police officer about a block away at 13th Street and 57th Court and pulled a gun that was pointed at the officer, Hanania said. An officer chasing the suspect witnessed the incident and shot the suspect, who was taken in serious condition to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood.


Police Chief Bernard Harrison and Cicero Town President Larry Dominick contacted State Police to investigate.
