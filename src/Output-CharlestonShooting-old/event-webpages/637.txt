Police arrest suspected drunk driver after pursuit


 


ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – The Missouri Highway Patrol arrested a suspected drunk driver who led troopers on a two county pursuit that ended in a crash near Lambert Tuesday night.
Authorities got a call about a woman in a white Chevy pickup heading eastbound on I-70 in Wentzville. When troopers found her, she took off, with speeds passing 100 miles an hour. The highway patrol says she struck a tractor-trailer near 70 and 141. The chase ended when she struck an abandoned vehicle near 70 and Cypress.
Authorities say she also had outstanding warrants, and was taken to the hospital.
