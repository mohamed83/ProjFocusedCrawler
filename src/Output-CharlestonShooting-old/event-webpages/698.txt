MILLCREEK, Utah – Police are seeking the public’s help in finding a person who robbed a Millcreek gas station at gunpoint Monday night.
At 10:19 p.m., a man entered a Chevron Gas Station, 310 E. 3900 South, and brandished a handgun, according to Unified police.
Police say the suspect order customers out of the store then confronted the clerk and demanded cash. The clerk complied with the suspect giving him an undisclosed amount of cash. The suspect then fled westbound on foot.
Police believe the suspect is also responsible for a similar robbery that occurred Sunday at an Exxon gas station in Taylorsville.
The suspect is described as a Hispanic male in his late teens. He is described as 5 feet 11 inches with a thin build. He was last seen wearing a black windbreaker, a black bandana over his face and black shorts.
Anyone with information on the suspect is asked to call Unified police at 385-468-9814.
