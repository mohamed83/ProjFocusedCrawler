CHICAGO (STMW) —
 A suspected armed robber was shot after Chicago Police say he charged at an officer in the South Side Canaryville neighborhood, making the officer’s gun discharge.


About 3:15 a.m., officers were flagged down by someone claiming their cell phone was taken by three people at Cermak and State, all who then fled in a vehicle, police said.


The three were found in a vehicle in the 500 block of West 43rd Street some time later. A male in the vehicle got out and showed a handgun in his waistband, police said. He then “charged the officer hitting him with his body,” causing the officer’s weapon to discharge.


Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden said the suspect elbowed the officer in the chest as he was getting out of the car, causing the officer’s gun to accidentally discharge. The suspect was struck in the arm and chest.


The armed suspect, who had been shot, dropped his weapon and ran off in an unknown direction, police said. A weapon was later recovered at the scene, police said.


The two others in the vehicle were arrested without incident.


The male who was shot was later found at Mercy Hospital with a gunshot wound and is in “guarded” condition. He is in police custody.


Camden said he was later transferred to Stroger Hospital.


Charges were pending against all three Friday morning, police said. No officers were hurt.


The Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates all police-involved shootings, was notified of the incident at 3:45 a.m., spokesman Larry Merritt said.

Officials investigating second fire at black church in South Carolina

Officials investigating second fire at black church in South Carolina


 


GREELEYVILLE, S.C. — A fire broke out at the Mt. Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church in Greeleyville, S.C., on Tuesday. Up to 50 firefighters fought to extinguish the blaze, a fire official said.
So far, authorities do not know what caused it, said Williamsburg County Fire Chief Randy Swinton.
The local sheriff, local police and the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division also responded to the fire at the traditionally black church.
The FBI and five agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also investigating, said ATF Special Agent Tom Mangan.
“Anytime there is a house of worship involved in a fire, ATF is automatically assigned to look into the cause,” he said.
A sniffer dog will likely be sent in during the first phase of the investigation, once the embers cool down, said Nero Priester, an ATF arson specialist. That could be as early as Wednesday afternoon.
The church’s brick walls were still standing early Wednesday, but the flames gutted the entire interior, fire officials told CNN affiliate WCIV.
Previous hate crime
The church’s previous structure burned in 1995 as a result of hate-motivated arson during a spate of about 30 fires that swept black churches in Southern states at the time. Members of the Ku Klux Klan were responsible for that attack, Mangan said.
Then President Bill Clinton spoke at the new church structure in 1996 days before its official dedication, calling for racial unity in the United States.
Greeleyville is a small town in rural Williamsburg County in the eastern part of the state.
Senior Bishop John Bryant of AME’s national headquarters said Tuesday night’s fire “will not send us into despair or depression. As Christians, we are a people of resurrection and even from the ashes we will rise.”
Other fires
A racially motivated shooting in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston earlier this month triggered an outpouring sympathy and outrage throughout the country.
Since that shooting, at least six black churches have burned in the southeastern United States. Investigators have said that there has been no evidence these were hate crimes, nor that they were linked. Two of them may have been the result of arson.
Since the Charleston shooting, the most recent religious targets of hate crimes have been Jewish synagogues and Islamic mosques, the Southern Poverty Law Center said.
