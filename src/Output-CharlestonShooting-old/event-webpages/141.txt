 The man suspected of killing nine people at a historic African-American church in South Carolina Wednesday recently complained about "blacks taking over the world" a friend of the suspect said Thursday. 


 Joseph Meek Jr. told The Associated Press in an interview that slaying suspect Dylann Roof recently went on a rant about the Trayvon Martin case and riots in Baltimore over the death of a black man in police custody. The two were childhood friends and recently reconnected over Facebook. 


 "He said blacks were taking over the world. Someone needed to do something about it for the white race," Meek told the AP. "He said he wanted segregation between whites and blacks. I said, 'That's not the way it should be.' But he kept talking about it."

 Roof was previously jailed in March on a drug charge and then arrested again a month later for trespassing, records show. 


 Roof was picked up March 2 on the drug charge following a Feb. 28 incident at the Columbiana Centre, a shopping mall in Columbia, according to police records. 


 Mall security found Roof wearing all black and asking store employees "out of the ordinary" questions, according to an arrest report obtained by NBC News. 


 The questions included how many people worked at the stores and what time the establishments closed. Roof later told a police officer that his parents wanted him to find a job, according to the report.

Obama Eulogizes Pastor in Charleston Shooting

CHARLESTON, South Carolina (CNN)–
President Barack Obama on Friday eulogized the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, one of the victims in last week’s church massacre, calling him a “man of God who lived by faith.”
“We are here today to remember a man of God who lived by faith,” Obama said. “A man who believed in things not seen. A man who believed there were better days ahead, off in the distance. A man of service who persevered knowing full well he would not receive all those things he was promised, because he believed his efforts would provide a better life for those who followed.”
Friday’s funeral service for Pinckney isn’t the first time Obama delivered a high-profile eulogy, and with a year and a half remaining in office, it may not be the last.
But when the President stood in historic downtown Charleston to remember the slain pastor and eight others shot down in their church last week, his speech moved beyond just grief for the victims — Obama stepped directly into a national conversation about race in which he plays a central role.
The President, first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, a bipartisan host of high-level members of Congress and Hillary Clinton headed to TD Arena for the memorial service a week after a 21-year-old man opened fire at a Bible study inside Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.
The shooter declared he was there to “kill black people,” and an online manifesto attributed to him contained white supremacist screeds.
Obama, responding to the shooting hours into its aftermath, said the attack “raises questions about a dark part of our history” and called racism “a particular threat to our democracy and our ideals.”
Later, speaking during a podcast interview, he candidly addressed new questions about American racism prompted by the attack, using the N-word to explain that suggestions the country has been “cured” of racism are misguided.
The shooting in Charleston left Obama “shaken,” according to Rep. James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who spoke with Obama the morning after the incident.
Unlike past times Obama has confronted an act of violence, he knew the highest profile victim of the Charleston shooting personally. Obama met Pinckney as an early supporter of his 2008 presidential bid. Biden met the pastor and state lawmaker less than a year ago at a prayer breakfast in the state capital.
That personal connection differentiated Friday’s eulogy from the funerals Obama keynoted after previous shootings. So, too, are the renewed questions on race spurred by the shooter’s apparent motivations.
Around the country, traditional symbols of the Confederacy have come under renewed scrutiny, including the Confederate flag that flies at the South Carolina State House.
Obama himself used some of his bluntest language to date on race during an interview with comedian Marc Maron on Friday, saying that just because the N-word is no longer used frequently in public, “that’s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not.”
The moment was a distant cry from the earlier days of Obama’s presidency, when he studiously avoided discussing race or the implications of his election to office.
“I think that the President has grown very weary of having to circumvent these issues, which a lot of people thought was the appropriate thing for him to do as President of the United States,” Clyburn said. “But I think he has reached a conclusion that he needs to meet this issue head-on.”
Ryan Julison, who is a spokesman for Walter Scott’s family, told CNN “The family of Walter Scott will attend today’s funeral for Reverend Pinckney. They want to show the same support to the community that the community showed to them.”

 The officer, who said Roof looked nervous, then searched him and found an unlabeled white bottle and orange strips, according to the report . Roof claimed they were Listerine Strips but then admitted that they were unprescribed suboxone, a Schedule 3 narcotic used to treat opiate addictions. 


 He was arrested and charged with possession of controlled substances. His car, a Hyundai Elantra, was also towed. 


 Roof was banned from the mall for a year, but on April 26, he was charged with trespassing after he was found in the same mall's parking lot, Columbia police said. He was banned from the mall for three more years. 


 The car that was towed in March was the same one used when he the gunman fled Wednesday night's rampage at Emanuel AME, authorities said. Charleston officials are investigating the shooting as a hate crime. The U.S. Justice Department also announced that it is opening a parallel civil rights investigation. 


 As the manhunt intensified Thursday morning, Roof's uncle told Reuters that he recognized the man in the surveillance photo as his nephew.

 Cowles later told 
MSNBC
 that he "hopes [Roof] gets what's coming to him." 


 "We didn't see this coming," he said. "We had no clue. And I will say this: I hope he gets what's coming to him. They got his ass now." 


 He added, "Not only has he destroyed nine people's lives and his own, he's destroyed his whole family."
