NEW ORLEANS — A man wanted in the killing of a New Orleans police officer is in custody, according to the New Orleans Police Department’s 
Twitter account.


Travis Boys, 33, allegedly shot and killed officer Daryle Holloway in his patrol car Saturday morning as Boys was being transported to a prison.


Boys allegedly freed himself from handcuffs, grabbed a weapon, shot Holloway and then fled the scene, sparking a manhunt that continued until Sunday morning.


New Orleans Police Superintendent Michael Harrison praised Holloway, a 22-year veteran of the force, and prayed for his family on Saturday.


“Officer Holloway was a dedicated police officer who proudly served his community for more than 20 years and was a father of three. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him,” the chief said.


Holloway, 45, was taking Boys from the police department to Orleans Parish Prison. Boys was arrested on outstanding warrants and also face a charge of aggravated battery, police said.
