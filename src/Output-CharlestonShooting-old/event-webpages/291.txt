THE BRONX (PIX11)–
 A teenager was shot and killed in the Bronx Friday morning, and now police are looking for two suspects.


Gunfire erupted around 8:30 a.m. as 14-year-old Christopher Duran was walking near his home at 1181 Sheridan Ave. in the Concourse section of the Bronx, police said.

Duran was struck three in the stomach and once in the head after an argument with two men. The teen was pronounced dead at the scene.


Sources tell PIX11 the shooting may have been gang-related.


One suspect was described as black or dark-skinned Hispanic man, wearing all black,  and the second was described as a male Hispanic wearing a light colored hooded sweatshirt with dark sleeves, blue jeans and a red bandana covering his face. Police released an image of the second suspect, below.

GoFundMe page for sister of accused Charleston church shooter taken down

SHELBY, N.C. — A GoFundMe page for the sister of the man accused of killing nine people at a Charleston church was taken down Thursday.
According to WCIV, Amber Roof was asking for help recovering expenses from her wedding that was delayed.
Roof was set to get married the weekend after the June 17 shooting at Emanuel AME in Charleston but was forced to postpone the wedding after her brother Dylann Roof was implicated in the shooting.
“June 21st was suppose (sic) to be the happiest day of our lives. It is the day every girl dreams of, it was the day we dreamed of.  We had each other, we have the perfect venue, and we had our vows ready to be read,” she wrote on GoFundMe.
The fund, as of 11:30 a.m. Thursday, had just over $1,500 contributed. As of 1:30 p.m., the fundraiser was taken down.
Roof played a key role in her brother’s arrest. She was the one who notified officials after seeing the photo of Dylann on television that was circulated by law enforcement officials.
Dylann Roof was later arrested by police during a traffic stop after being followed for 30 miles by a North Carolina florist who said she spotted the suspect driving next to her.
