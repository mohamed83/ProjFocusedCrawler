CHICAGO (CBS) —
 A 14-year-old boy was in the hospital early Friday, after Chicago police shot him when he allegedly refused to drop a weapon in the South Chicago neighborhood.


Around 10:30 p.m. Thursday, police responded to a report of shots fired by two suspects on bicycles in the 8900 block of South Escanaba Avenue.


When officers arrived, they were able to stop one of the suspects, but as they tried to question him, they noticed a bulge in his pocket. When they asked him about it, he ran off.


Officers began chasing him, and soon noticed he was now carrying the gun. Police said he ignored repeated commands to drop the weapon.


“After repeated attempts to stop, and to drop the weapon, the subject refused. One officer shot the offender, striking him once in the leg,” Chicago Police Cmdr. Christopher Fletcher said.


Police said the gun was recovered at the scene.


The 14-year-old was taken to the University of Chicago’s Comer Children’s Hospital. His mother, Ikyshia Webber, says the teen was expected to be transferred to a hospital in a juvenile detention facility. She tells CBS 2’s Suzanne Le Mignot the boy has not been in trouble with the law previously.


His stepfather, Timothy Gilmore, said the bullet passed through both of the boy’s legs.


“The only thing I know that it went through the left leg, exited the left leg, and went through the right thigh, exited the right leg,” he said.


 


The other suspect has not been caught.


Meantime, the injured teen’s 18-year-old brother, Donzell Lightfoot, was due to appear in bond court on Friday, for allegedly punching an officer in the head and damaging a police vehicle, after officers blocked him from entering the crime scene. Webber said he was just trying to cross a police line to check on his brother, as he laid on the ground, bleeding.


Lightfoot has been charged with one felony count of aggravated battery, and one misdemeanor count each of disobeying a police officer, resisting or obstructing a police officer, and criminal property damage.

Former NC senator’s sister among 9 killed in Charleston church shooting


 Cynthia Hurd.


The sister of former North Carolina senator Malcolm Graham was among the nine people killed while attending a Bible study inside the Emmanuel AME church in Charleston Wednesday night.
Cynthia Hurd was a librarian at the Charleston Public Library for 31 years. Hurd had “dedicated her life to serving and improving the lives of others,” the Charleston County Public Library system said in a statement.
“Charleston County Public Library is saddened to confirm the loss of one of our own in Wednesday’s shooting at the Mother Emmanuel AME Church,” the statement said. “To honor our co-worker and all those lost, Charleston County Public Library’s 16 locations are closed today, Thursday, June 18, 2015.”
Hurd was the manager of the St. Andrews Regional Library, located a little more than six miles from the church where she was shot and killed.
“My sister, Ms. Cynthia Marie Graham-Hurd, was a victim of the senseless hate crime at Emanuel AME Church. It is unimaginable that she would walk into church and not return,” former Senator Graham said in a statement Thursday. “But that’s who she was – a woman of faith. This is a very difficult time for our family, and Cynthia will be sorely missed.”
“Our family is close-knit, and our faith will see us through. I also extend condolences to the other families of Emanuel AME Church and the city of Charleston who have been affected by this inconceivable tragedy,” he continued. “My family and I appreciate the thoughts and prayers from people across North Carolina and South Carolina.”

Sen. Clementa Pinckney
Also killed was S.C. Sen. Clementa Pinckney, a pastor well-known for fighting racism from the pulpit and with public policy. Sen. Pinckney also was an alum of Allen University in Columbia, S.C.
Another Allen University alum, Tywanza Sanders, was also killed. He was a 2014 graduate. Allen University in a statement described him as a quiet, well-known student who was committed to his education.
“Our hearts and prayers are with the families of these two victims of this senseless act of violence.” – Dr. Lady June Cole, Interim President of Allen University.

A Charleston university said that the mother of one of its students was killed in the church shooting, the Washington Post reported.
“We are especially mourning the loss of Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, the mother of rising sophomore Chris Singleton,” Charleston Southern University President Jairy C. Hunter Jr. said in a statement Thursday.
Chris Singleton is a member of the university’s baseball team, Hunter said. He added that the team’s players and coaches are reeling from the shooting, with the head coach saying Sharonda Coleman-Singleton made an “immeasurable” contribution to the team.

Another killed was Myra Thompson.

Dylan Storm Roof, the 21-year-old man who police say walked into a South Carolina church and fatally shot nine people attending Bible study class, was arrested in Shelby, N.C., on Thursday, about 250 miles from Charleston.
