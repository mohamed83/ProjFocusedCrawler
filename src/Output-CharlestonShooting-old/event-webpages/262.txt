CHICAGO (CBS) —
 Police officers fired shots while chasing a gunman Monday afternoon in the Bronzeville neighborhood, just a couple blocks away from Chicago Police Headquarters.


Around 12:50 p.m., officers saw a man firing a gun in the 3400 block of South Indiana Avenue, and began chasing him.


During the chase, officers fired shots, but no one was injured.


The gunman was arrested, but no charges had been filed as of late Monday afternoon. The shooting occurred less than two blocks from Police Headquarters, at 3510 S. Michigan Av.


The Independent Police Review Authority was notified of the shooting.


It was the second shooting involving police officers on Monday.


Early Monday morning, an off-duty officer was shot by a would-be robber while the officer was taking his son out of his car in the Clearing neighborhood near Midway International Airport.


The officer fired back, and said he believes he wounded the gunman, who got away.


The officer suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and to the wrist. He was treated at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, and was released Monday afternoon.
