Church security a consideration after deadly South Carolina shooting

=======
GREENSBORO, N.C. – As the nation grieves for the people in Charleston, churches in the Piedmont are being forced to think about security.
It’s a difficult topic for many churches that want to demonstrate being a place of faith and not fear.
However, one Piedmont man who specializes in church security says the state of the world has local pastors weighing their options.
“The church wants to have that open-door policy and that creates vulnerability in and of itself,” said Greg Leimone, president of Sentinel Consulting Group.
Leimone is a former Greensboro police officer and also served as a security specialist for a FEMA disaster response team.
His company works with a variety of businesses, but also helps local churches build security plans.
“It’s a terrible incident,” Leimone said. “It’s just a time for mourning and prayer for the families, but security is everyone’s responsibility.”
Leimone’s current project is working with a church in High Point to have a strategic plan that includes a lockdown procedure.
“Sunday service, an armed subject comes into the building, how do we evacuate Sunday School, those who are in mass, those who are in meetings in the prayer room, we’ve got nursery going on, how do you manage that?” he asked hypothetically.
He admits the idea of welcoming security is a tough balance.
“Some are very aloof and standoffish about it. They don’t want to feel restricted.”
“We can’t lock it down like Fort Knox,” he added.
Leimone says oftentimes the greatest barrier for churches investing in security is a lack of funding.
Leimone’s hope is that while the world prays for the congregation in Charleston, pastors everywhere will start having conversations with their own members.
