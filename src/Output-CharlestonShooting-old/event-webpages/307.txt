Ryan Herndon, 26
ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) – Two children were found in a suspect’s car after a police pursuit through south and west St. Louis County. The chase ended on I-55 near south Lindbergh. Investigators say it started when a woman called police saying she was being kidnapped from her job.
They began looking for her at Lindbergh and Mueller. Then police received a call for a speeding vehicle in the same area.
An officer tried to stop the suspicious car, but it kept going. The chase entered west county and police deployed stop sticks near I-55 and Lindbergh. The police used a taser to subdue the suspect then took him into custody.
Two children were in the back seat of the suspect’s vehicle. They were not hurt. The woman who called police is cooperating. No word on whether she was in the car.
Ryan Herdon, 26 of  Ferguson has been charged with two counts of assault on a law enforcement officer, two counts of endangering the welfare of child , one count of resisting arrest, and four counts of leaving the scene of an accident. Herndon is being held on a $50,000 cash only bond.
