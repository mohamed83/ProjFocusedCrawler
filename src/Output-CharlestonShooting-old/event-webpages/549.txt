        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREWhat happened: A gunman sat with a Bible group for about an hour Wednesday evening at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., before pulling out a weapon and firing, reportedly reloading several times. Nine people are dead.The suspect: FBI identified Dylann Storm Roof, 21, as the suspect in the shooting. Roof was captured Thursday on Highway 74 in Shelby, N.C., 245 miles northwest of Charleston. He was on the run for about 14 hours. The suspect waived extradition from North Carolina and was taken to a waiting police car wearing a bulletproof vest, with shackles on his feet and his hands cuffed behind his back. Roof also waived his right to counsel, meaning he will either represent himself or hire his own lawyer.The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church sits at 110 Calhoun St. in Charleston, S.C. (Photo: Facebook)Roof's Facebook page hints at a racist outlook. He drove a car with a Confederate flag front plate, wore a jacket with the patches of apartheid South Africa and the formerly white-ruled African country of Rhodesia, and hung with the outcasts in high school. Lexington County, S.C., court records show Roof was arrested on March 2 on criminal possession of a controlled substance, and he was also jailed on April 26 on a trespassing charge.A note on the sidewalk by the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., shows photos of the nine church members who were killed on Wednesday, June 17. (Photo: Curtis Compton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)
