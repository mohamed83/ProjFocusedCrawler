 The call to serve God and his community came early to the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was 
killed in a shooting in one of the country's oldest and most prominent African-American churches
 on Wednesday night. 


 "Rev. Pinckney answered the call to preach at the age of 13 and received his first appointment to pastor at the age of 18," according to the website of 
Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church
 in Charleston, South Carolina. At 23, Pinckney was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives, and in 2000, he was elected to the State Senate as a Democrat.

 Two sources told NBC News that Pinckney, 41, was among nine killed during during a Bible study session
 
on Wednesday. Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen said the shooting was being investigated as a hate crime. The gunman remained at large Thursday. 


 Pinckney played a key role in passing a bill mandating that police officers wear body cameras, according to the Rev. Joseph Darby of Beaufort AME Church. The law came into effect after a white policeman killed Walter Scott, an unarmed black man in North Charleston on April 4. 


 "He has sponsored progressive legislation, played a key role in us just getting body camera legislation passed," he 
told MSNBC
. "He was a very caring and competent pastor and he was a very brave man. And brave men sometimes die very difficult deaths."

 Darby added: "He was not insulting, he was not the loudest in the room but he knew how to maneuver to get things done and he knew how to take a stand and hold to that stand. And when you do that you rankle some people who people who think in strange way so it is not surprising."

 Tim Scott, a U.S. Senator for South Carolina, also paid tribute to Pinckney. 


 "Tonight we stand together in prayer for Pastor Pinckney and his congregation at Emanuel AME, and for the families who are enduring unimaginable pain at the loss of their loved ones," he said. 


 Pinckney was born in South Carolina's Jasper County on July 30, 1973. He was married to Jennifer with whom he had two daughters. He received a Master's of Divinity from the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, according to the church's website.

STATEMENT BY REV. AL SHARPTON ON THE KILLING OF NINE PEOPLE AT EMANUEL AME CHURCH IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
National Action Network
June 18, 2015
 
STATEMENT BY REV. AL SHARPTON ON THE KILLING OF NINE PEOPLE AT EMANUEL AME CHURCH IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA
 
NEW YORK – Rev. Al Sharpton, President of National Action Network (NAN), released the following statement on the shooting death of nine people at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina: 
 
“I am shocked and outraged about the killing of nine innocent people at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. What has our society come to when people in a prayer meeting in the sacred halls of a church can be shot in what is deemed a possible hate crime?
 
“The Pastor of the church, Reverend Clementa Pinckney, worked closely with our National Action Network Chapter leader and our Vice President of Religious Affairs, Rev. Nelson Rivers. It is chilling to me that just over two months ago while I was in North Charleston over the police shooting of Walter Scott, I’m reminded that Rev. Pinckney was among the clergy who stood with me at that occasion and now he has fallen victim to senseless violence.
 
“We must do what we can to apprehend the killer and we must support the families involved in this tragedy. Demagoguery, increasing tension, and talk of violence will only make a mockery of what we face.”
