Attorney General Loretta Lynch: A ‘Heartbreaking Event’ 
Loretta E. Lynch, the United States  attorney general, said that with a suspect in the church attack now in custody — “if he is in fact the shooter” —  the authorities will need to determine involvement and motivation, and decide whether to pursue the matter on the state or federal level.
Calling it a “heartbreaking event,” she said, “We will do everything in our power to help heal this community and make it whole again.”
She was speaking at a news conference that had been scheduled to discuss charges in Medicare fraud schemes, but started the event with comments on the shooting, and took questions at the end.
The F.B.I. director, James. B. Comey, also attended the news conference.
In response to a question, he said there were no  efforts being made to reach out  to religious communities. “Not yet,” he said.
Ms. Lynch said they would be coordinated at the local level.
