(June 18, 2015) — Thursday evening church members in Indianapolis gathered to show their support for the victims in the Charleston Church shooting rampage. 
St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church is part of the same predominantly black religious organization as the historic church in Charleston that came under attack Wednesday night.
“There is comfort in prayers. We hope to be strengthen in prayer,” explained Pastor Lenore Williams with St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church.
Religious leaders from many backgrounds came to the prayer service.
“When we read about passages in the scriptures. That say when one mourns the other weeps. We feel like we have lost family member,” said Williams.
Church member Pearla Gholdston attended a service at the Charleston church and met Pastor Pinckney just last year.
“I was saddened and deeply and almost went into shock. I could not believe it.  It was difficult for me to sleep last night because of my knowledge of him,” said Gholdston.
Pastor Pinckney, who was also a state senator, was one of nine people killed.
The FBI is investigating this shooting rampage as a hate crime.
“For that violence to take place in the sanctuary directed at people for their color of skin. It is sad.  We are going to pray. All of us are God`s children,” said Pastor Lenore Williams with St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church.
The shootings come as Indianapolis is preparing to host two prominent African Methodist Episcopal conferences next month.
Organizers tell our partners at the Indy Star they are planning a prayer service for the shooting victims.

US newsWhat happened at the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting?
 
On Wednesday 17 June nine people were shot dead during a bible study group at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church.
CCTV footage released by police shows a man identified as 21-year-old Dylann Roof entering the church at 20:17 EDT. Witnesses said he spent around fifty minutes inside with the group before opening fire and then driving away.
 
Was the suspect arrested?
 
Dylann Roof was stopped in his car and arrested, following a tip-off, on Thursday 18 June in the city of Shelby, North Carolina around 400 km north-west of Charleston.
During the manhunt police described him as “highly dangerous” and said they had “no doubt” the shooting was a hate crime. 
 
What do we know about
 the suspect?
 
Roof is from the town of Eastover, around 150 km north-west of Charleston. According to the state law enforcement division, he was arrested on 1 March 2015 for drug possession and again on 26 April on a trespassing charge.
Roof’s uncle told Reuters he recognised his nephew from the CCTV image (above) and that he had received a gun for his 21st birthday in April. A photograph from Roof’s Facebook page shows him wearing a jacket with the historical flags of apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) on it.
 
Who has died?
 
Six women and three men were killed including 41-year-old Clementa Pinckney (pictured), the church pastor and a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate. He had campaigned for police to wear body cameras after Walter Scott, a black man, was shot dead in April by a police officer in the adjacent city of North Charleston as he tried to run away. Pinckney’s sister was also said to have died at the church. Three people survived the attack 
 
 Senator Pinckney was my friend for over 20 years. I’m speechless, heartbroken and angry. God grant his family some peace right now
 
– South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford
 
How many hate crime incidents have been reported in the United States?
 
According to the most recent FBI statistics, there were a total of 3,407 hate crimes motivated by race in 2013.
 
Why is this church significant?
 
The Emanuel AME church has one of the largest black congregations south of Baltimore and a history entwined with that of race relations and the civil rights struggle in the US. 
It traces its roots back to 1816 and was burnt by white landowners in 1822 after one of its founders, Denmark Veysey, tried to organise a slave revolt. The Reverend Martin Luther King addressed the church in 1962 while in 1969 his wife, Coretta Scott King, led a 1,500-person march in support of striking hospital workers to the church where they faced bayonet-wielding members of the South Carolina National Guard 
 
What is Charleston’s racial makeup?
 
The racial breakdown of the peninsula has shifted since 1980, from roughly two-thirds black to two-thirds white in 2010. The historic black church now lies within a mostly white area of the city
