Police-Involved Shooting
, 
Roseland
=======


>>>>>>> origin/master






<<<<<<< HEAD




(STMW)
 — A “belligerent” woman with a butcher knife was shot and killed by police Thursday evening in the Roseland neighborhood on the Far South Side.


Officers responded to a domestic-related call about 6:40 p.m. in the 10900 block of South Eberhart Avenue, according to a statement from the Chicago Police Department.


When officers entered the scene the woman was in a domestic dispute with a relative and was “belligerent and acting totally violent” with a knife, Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden said.


The woman was possibly under the influence of narcotics, police said.


The officers told the woman to drop the butcher knife several times, but instead she raised the knife and lunged at them, authorities said. In self-defense, one of the officers drew his weapon and fatally shot the woman.


Angelique Styles, 60, of the 10900 block of South Eberhart Avenue, was pronounced dead at 8:03 p.m. at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.


There were no other injuries and the weapon was recovered at the scene, police said.


The Independent Police Review Authority, which examines all police-involved shootings, has launched an investigation, a spokesman said.

Thursday’s shooting comes two days after an officer was stabbed in the face in the 200 block of East 107th Street. That officer received 53 stitches in the face, Camden said.
