Anderson police seek shooting suspect






 






ANDERSON, Ind. (Aug. 15, 2015)–Anderson Police are seeking a suspect they believe shot a man and left him lying in the street.


Anderson Police investigators have identified 18-year-old Malik Montgomery as the primary suspect in shooting incident Saturday afternoon.


Shortly before 4:30 p.m., Anderson Police were called to the 1800 block of West 9th Street on the report of multiple gunshots in the area.


Police found shell casings and broken auto glass.  They had what appeared to be a crime scene, but those involved had already fled.


A short time later officers were sent to the 2600 block of Horton Drive where they found Christopher  A. McCord lying in the street suffering from a gunshot wound to his right hip.


McCord was taken to St. Vincent Hospital Anderson and then was flown to St. Vincent’s Indianapolis by medical helicopter.


Police believe the two men may have been taking part in a pre-arranged fight that ended in gunfire.


Investigators say they want to talk to Montgomery in relation to the shooting.  Police say he should be considered armed and dangerous and should not be approached by the public.


Anyone with information about the incident or Montgomery’s whereabouts is asked to call Anderson Police at (765) 648-6930.

        COMMENTEMAILMOREFaith leaders from several Space Coast denominations will hold a special prayer vigil for the victims of an overnight church shooting that left nine people – including a state senator and church pastor – dead.The vigil comes after Dylan Storm Roof, 21, allegedly carried out the attack at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the oldest African-American congregations in the South. Police have labeled the targeted shooting a hate crime.Glenn Dames, pastor of St. James AME Church in Titusville, knew pastor and South Carolina State Senator Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the shooting.Pinckney, 41, was listed among nine victims shot and killed by the gunman during the Wednesday night bible study.FLORIDA TODAY9 dead in shooting at black church in Charleston, S.C."This has been a difficult night for us…I knew (Pinckney)," Dames told FLORIDA TODAY. "I've been to Emanuel. As a pastor, I know the pain of seeing something like this happen. We believe that in the end, love will conquer hate as difficult as it is to wrap our heads around that right now."The prayer vigil will take place at 7 p.m. tonight at St. James AME Church, 625 Dummitt Ave. in Titusville. The congregation has in the past hosted several community prayer sessions and talks over issues ranging from the 2012 controversial shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in neighboring Sanford to the recent spate of protests over police tactics."In times like these, we need an anchor…and that Rock is Jesus," he said between fielding calls from other pastors and church members.Other pastors were stunned by the killings and called for the faith community to continue building inroads together."My God, when is this going to end," asked Father Rob Goodridge of St. Gabriel Episcopal Church in Titsuville. "The only way any of this will be resolved is if we develop relationships with each other. I just don't understand it. There's an uptick of this kind of (violence) not just in our country but around the world. But when you look at things and if it's not good, it's not from God. It's from something else," he said, adding that more prayer is needed.
