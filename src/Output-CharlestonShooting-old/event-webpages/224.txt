ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI)- A 16 year old is in serious but stable condition after being shot three times Saturday night by a St. Louis city police officer. The officer says the teenager ran toward him holding a gun.
It began around 7:15pm when officers responded to a call from a housing complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont. The call came from a woman who said she saw someone she thought had stolen her recently purchased .40-caliber pistol.
St. Louis Metropolitan Police Chief Sam Dotson explained what the officer said happened next, “As the officers responded the subject started to run, saw police officers and turned and ran in another direction. Ran toward officers, the officers saw a gun in his hand, fearing for his safety the officer fired four shots. The subject was struck, a graze wound once in the head, once in the arm, and again the most serious wound is to his stomach.”
The victim’s mother, Antoinette Liggins, told reporter, “It scared me because I lost my 14 year old in `08. She was killed …a little boy was playing with a gun and shot and killed her. And that and that is all I can think about. I don’t want anything to happen to another one of my children, y`know.”
Security cameras belonging to the housing complex caught the shooting on video.  Police said they recovered a gun at the scene.
The police officer who fired is a 29-year-old white male who has been on the force seven years. The shooting will be reviewed by the department’s new Force Investigative Unit.
