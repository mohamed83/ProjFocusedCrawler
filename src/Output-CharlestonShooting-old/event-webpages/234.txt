 (CNN)
Dylann Roof 
heard words of forgiveness from families of some of the nine people he's accused of killing.
His response: A blank expression.
Wearing a striped inmate jumpsuit, the 21-year-old appeared Friday afternoon by video feed at a bond hearing in Charleston, South Carolina. He stood motionless while listening to the anguished words of relatives of victims he gunned down Wednesday night at a Bible study at the historic 
Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church
.
"I will never be able to hold her again, but I forgive you," a daughter of Ethel Lance said. "And have mercy on your soul. You hurt me. You hurt a lot of people but God forgives you, and I forgive you."
Felicia Sanders -- mother of victim Tywanza Sanders and a survivor of the church shooting herself -- said that "every fiber in my body hurts, and I will never be the same." 
"As we said in the Bible study, we enjoyed you," she said of Roof. "But may God have mercy on you."
The families got the attention of President Obama, who tweeted: "In the midst of darkest tragedy, the decency and goodness of the American people shines through in these families."

Roof's family spoke out for the first time Friday, extending its "deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims," according to a statement issued by his public defender. 
"Words cannot express our shock, grief and disbelief as to what happened that night. We are devastated and saddened by what occurred.  We offer our prayers sympathy for all of those impacted by these events," the statement says. It ends asking for privacy for the Roof family.
Roof barely spoke at the hearing, answering the judge's questions about his unemployment with a "yes, sir" and "no, sir" and stating his age as 21. The video feed meant Roof could hear, but not see, people in the courtroom, according to court employees. People in the courtroom could see and hear Roof.
Magistrate James B. Gosnell Jr. drew fire on social media by opening the hearing by expressing sympathy for Roof's family.
 He spoke about how Charleston would embrace all the crime victims and said: "There are victims on this young man's side of the family. Nobody would have ever thrown them into the whirlwind of events that they were thrown into. ... We must find it in our hearts at some point in time to not only help those who are victims but to help his family as well."
Tweeted Desiree P. Urquhart @CBMaiden, "Magistrate James Gosnell Jr is an example of white southern bigotry, ignorant pontification & a good ole boy's entitlement to say anything."

Elizabeth Bradbury @isabellabc tweeted, "For those who don't understand why blacks in America are still angry just watch Judge Gosnell's lecture to the court at Roof's hearing."

Gosnell set bail at $1 million on a weapons possession charge. A circuit judge will hold a bond hearing later on the nine murder charges, but it's unlikely Roof will be allowed to leave jail.
The suspect actually is being held in the North Charleston jail. Authorities didn't want him to appear at the bond hearing in person for security reasons. 
Roof also may be prosecuted by federal authorities if it's determined he committed a hate crime. The Justice Department issued a statement Friday saying, "This heartbreaking episode was undoubtedly designed to strike fear and terror into this community, and the department is looking at this crime from all angles, including as a hate crime and as an act of domestic terrorism."
Roof admits he did it, sources say
Roof admits he shot and killed the people he'd sat with for Bible study at the historically black church, two law enforcement officials said.
But why? To start a race war.
That's what Roof told investigators, according to one of the officials.

CNN's Evan Perez and Wesley Bruer were the first to report Roof's confession. Others earlier gave a glimpse into the twisted motivation -- including at the time and site of the shooting.
There, a survivor told Sylvia Johnson that Roof answered one man's pleas to stop by saying, "No, you've raped our women, and you are taking over the country ... I have to do what I have to do."
CNN Charlotte affiliate WBTV, citing a source, says Roof told investigators in Shelby, North Carolina, where he was arrested, that he had researched the church and targeted it because it turned out to be a "historic African-American church."
A friend recalled a drunken Roof ranting one night about his unspecified six-month plan "to do something crazy" in order "to start a race war." And the Berkeley County, South Carolina, government tweeted a picture of him in a jacket with flags from apartheid-era South Africa and nearby Rhodesia, a former British colony that was ruled by a white minority until it became independent in 1980.

By telling authorities his aim, Roof admitted he attacked unarmed civilians for political purposes in an act of terror.
What led the South Carolinian to adopt this reasoning and take such actions Wednesday night? Did anyone else help him or even know about his plans? And what is his general mental state? All are major, looming questions. Another is what American society should or will do now, if anything, to prevent similar tragedies.
In the meantime, 
nine families are left to mourn
 and a community is left to come together, ideally, to heal.
"This hateful person came to this community with some crazy idea that he would be able to divide," Mayor Joseph Riley said. "And all he did was make us more united, and love each other even more."

Roof faces a long legal road ahead. 
It could end in his execution, assuming he's convicted and prosecutors seek (and are granted) such a death sentence, 
according to South Carolina law
. Gov. Nikki Haley indicated that's what she wants, while Charleston's mayor -- while he doesn't support the death penalty personally -- thinks it's inevitable.
"If you're going to have a death penalty," Riley said, "then certainly this case will merit it."
Friend: Roof wanted 'white with white, and black with black'
How did Dylann Roof get to the point of being accused of one of the most hateful, violent race-related crimes in recent memory?
His uncle, Carson Cowles, told the Washington Post that Roof's mother "never raised him to be like this." Those who knew him, though, paint a picture of someone who has long voiced racist sentiments, even if they never anticipated he'd act on them like this.
John Mullins recalls "racist slurs in a sense" that Roof made while the two attended White Knoll High School in Lexington, South Carolina, though he also remembers him having black friends.
"He would say it just as a joke," Mullins told CNN. "I never took it seriously. But ... maybe (I) should have."

ho is Dylann Roof?
That sentiment was echoed by Joey Meek, who told CNN that he hadn't seen his old classmate for five years until the two became roommates about a month ago. He recalled Roof being quiet and keeping to himself since then, except for one night when he drank a liter of vodka and talked about his vague plans to start a race war.
"He wanted it to be white with white, and black with black," Meek said, adding that he took Roof's gun as a precaution that night only to put it back the next morning. "He had it in his mind, and he didn't really let nobody know (what he was going to do)."
Meek said he told Roof then that he "didn't agree with his opinion at all," but he didn't talk to authorities until Thursday, when he noticed surveillance photos and called a police hotline.
"Dylann wasn't a serious person, no one took him serious," Meek said. "But if someone had taken him serious, this all would all have been avoided."
Officials: Suspect bought gun in April
It's one thing to talk of stirring racial hatred, another to act on it to kill nine innocent people -- including the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a state senator who had welcomed Roof into the Bible study session.
One key part of this horrific scheme -- the weapon -- came in April, when Roof bought a .45-caliber handgun at a Charleston gun store, the two law enforcement officials told Perez and Bruer from CNN, the first network to report this development. His grandfather says that Roof was given "birthday money" and that the family didn't know what Roof did with it.

He apparently didn't hint at his intentions when he went to the historic church Wednesday. A Snapchat video shows him at a table with a small group, not anything to suggest the carnage to come.
An arrest warrant says Roof entered the church at 8:06 p.m. wearing a fanny pack. "After approximately an hour of studying," the warrant says, "the defendant stood up and with malice and aforethought pulled out a handgun and began shooting at the parishioners inside the hall striking nine victims. All victims were hit multiple times."
From what Johnson heard, Roof reloaded his gun five times. Six women died at the scene, as did two men -- with a third, the Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., passing away later during surgery. Johnson said her friend played dead, lying in the blood of her slain son.
Before Roof left the church, he asked one of the elderly members whether he had shot her, and she said no.
"And he said, 'Good, because we need a survivor because I'm going to kill myself,' " Johnson told CNN.

She followed him more than 30 miles, keeping authorities updated along the way.
Police in Shelby, North Carolina -- about  245 miles (395 kilometers) from Charleston -- pulled him over and took him into custody. He waived extradition and returned to South Carolina late Thursday. 
The Charleston Police Department also got help from Roof's family. The arrest warrant says: "The father and the uncle of the defendant contacted CPD and positively identified the defendant and his vehicle as those they saw in the photographs. Further, the defendant's father told investigators that his son owns a .45-caliber handgun."
Federal authorities have opened a hate crime investigation into the shooting at the oldest AME church in the South, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Charleston's mayor said that society should continue to talk about issues pertaining to race and try to educate people more, such as through an African-American history museum planned for a Charleston site where slaves used to land to be sold in the United States. But, he added, it may not be realistic to think you'll be able to change the minds of all racists.
"There's a lot of things we can do, in our country, to enhance the dialogue about race," Riley said. "But to get (hateful thoughts) out of the minds of very evil people ... is very difficult."

We’re not seeing more police shootings, just more news coverage

It feels like every week, a name is added to the list: another man, often black and unarmed, has died at the hands of police.
Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Jason Harrison, Walter Scott, Eric Harris, Freddie Gray, to name a few.
The headlines make it feel as if the country is experiencing an unprecedented wave of police violence, but experts say that isn’t the case. We’re just seeing more mainstream media coverage, and for a variety of reasons.
Let’s be clear: That’s just each expert’s sense of things. We rely on hunches because real numbers don’t exist, likely because no one thought it important to keep a tally until recently.
Chat with a publisher or editor at one of the country’s African-American newspapers, and she or he can tell you they’ve been covering these cases for a long time.
How long?
“We’ve been in business for 130 years,” said Robert Bogle, president and CEO of The Philadelphia Tribune, without a hint of sarcasm.
“What is being exposed nationally is something that’s been troubling us in Philadelphia as African-Americans,” he said. “Yes, we have written about it. We’ve talked about it. This is the African-American experience, and for some reason non-African-Americans don’t believe it.”
Sea change?
They’re starting to believe it, thanks to cell phones, said Cedric Alexander, the DeKalb County, Georgia, deputy COO of public safety and president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives.
“Black and brown people have been making these complaints for years, but they fell on deaf ears because no one wanted to believe some officers would act that way,” he said.
After video of Cleveland police killing the 12-year-old Rice outside a recreation center, New York police choking Garner as he cried “I can’t breathe” and Scott being repeatedly shot in the back as he fled an officer, the public’s skepticism is waning, he said.
People are realizing, “Wow, they really did shoot this guy in the back. Wow. Oh, s**t, there’s some truth to this,” Alexander said.
Black newspaper executives feel the videos lend credibility not only to black victims’ versions of events in specific situations, but also to their versions of events historically. Where a victim’s race could affect a story’s perceived veracity, video permits no such prejudice.
Alexander concurred, citing a common dilemma for inner-city kids: “If police say that’s what happened and you don’t have something to prove otherwise, you’re screwed.”
Had there been no video of Scott’s shooting, Bogle said, the public might have believed Officer Michael Slager’s story that he’d been attacked and had no choice but to fatally shoot Scott.
The video, though, taken by a bystander who happened upon the incident, showed Scott running as Slager shot him in the back. Slager now stands charged with Scott’s murder.
“When you have clear evidence that would contradict a different story, it’s difficult to engage in denial,” Bogle said.
Added Publisher Tracey Williams-Dillard of the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, another African-American newspaper: “Things are being recorded by others. There’s now no way it can be disputed.”
Where are the numbers?
Today, it seems like there’s a stat for everything.
Want to know the most common offense for which people are incarcerated? No problem. Need to know the percentage of fatal plane crashes caused by pilot error? Easy. The score of every Monday Night Football game since 1990? A breeze.
But if you want to know how many times a police officer has killed someone in the line of duty, you’re out of luck.
“It’s really ridiculous we don’t have that count,” said David Klinger, an associate criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. “For whatever reason, the powers that be that collect data for the feds … decided that how often police kill people doesn’t matter.”
Despite that the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 required the government to keep “data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers,” no such database exists. A study published 14 years ago sought to nail down numbers, but its author conceded to CNN that only 564 of the nation’s 18,000 law enforcement entities participated.
The closest thing to a statistic is the FBI’s assertion that police were responsible for about 400 “justifiable homicides” annually between 2008 and 2012.
Even if there were an accurate count, Klinger said, we’d still be “missing a huge part of the picture when it comes to deadly force.” Cops tend to shoot to kill — and gunfire is the predominant means by which police kill suspects — so more illuminating would be knowing how many times police opened fire, period, he said.
Can videos end cycle?
Bogle doesn’t need statistics, he said. It wasn’t many generations ago that black Americans could not find justice in lynchings and other racially motivated crimes, he said, explaining that extrajudicial killings by police are just a continuation.
“Black Americans and black Philadelphians have been talking about and addressing these issues, to no avail,” he said. “There’s no way to actually determine that there’s more or less. What’s occurred is there are more ways to expose it.”
Not only are we in a better position to capture video of police misbehavior today, we’re also better equipped to disseminate the footage. Instantaneity is important, he said.
Events that 10 years ago would’ve come down to a suspect’s word versus an officer’s are now recorded on cell phones and officers’ body and dashboard cameras. And where a news reporter could have taken days to travel to a city, find and interview witnesses and obtain a police narrative, a bystander can post video of a police encounter to the Internet minutes after it happens.
“That’s critical. If you see an incident a week later, that has an impact on the reaction,” Bogle said. “It’s not a timely event, and people’s reactions are different.”
Because humans are visual creatures, videos impact people more than might a written or spoken narrative, and many experts feel the images help drive coverage of the incidents.
“It not only feels like there’s more coverage, there is more coverage. … It’s not a perception, it’s definitely real,” Williams-Dillard said.
Don’t expect the videos to be a panacea for the violence, said Klinger, who counts police use of force among his research interests. Yes, video can refute a lie, but just as police have lied about suspects, suspects have lied about police as well.
“Most of the time when there’s video, it demonstrates the officer did the right thing,” he said. “I think it’s going to cut both ways. … We’re going to have a bunch of cried wolf.”
A ‘sensitized’ nation?
People’s attitudes are changing as well, said Irv Randolph, managing editor of The Philadelphia Tribune. Not only do you have people as influential as Attorney General Eric Holder speaking out, but civil rights is “front and center in terms of what young people are protesting against.”
Look no further than the rallies for Trayvon Martin, the teen killed in 2012 by a Florida neighborhood watch volunteer, or Scott in North Charleston. The protests drew diverse crowds, Randolph noted.
Likewise, the nonfatal but still racially charged incidents at two major American colleges — the arrest of a black student at the University of Virginia and racist chants by fraternity members at the University of Oklahoma — were condemned by folks of all races, he said.
“People are saying they’re not going to tolerate this anymore,” Randolph said.
Asked which factor — videos, social media or attitudes — was driving the recent spate of media coverage, Alexander said, “I think it’s all of the above.”
The nation, and especially its “communities of color,” is more “sensitized now to any contact with police,” he said.
But he’s reluctant to put the recent shootings under a single umbrella. For one, race isn’t always a factor in police brutality, he said, pointing out that the California man beaten after running from police on a horse, as well as James Boyd, the mentally ill man killed by Albuquerque police last year, were white.
The circumstances in many of the shootings also require that they be scrutinized differently, he said.

Similar yet different
In the Scott case, it’s “disturbing” to see Slager open fire on the 50-year-old, said Alexander, who has worked in a variety of local, state and federal law enforcement capacities since 1977.
“Something is wrong with that officer there,” he said. “Walter Scott was no threat. He wasn’t even able to run well when you watch the tape. We can pretty much clearly see that this guy was no threat to the officer.”
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, you have a septuagenarian reserve deputy providing containment in a “high-threat undercover gun sale” who shoots Eric Harris with his gun instead of his Taser. The debate has revolved around the deputy’s age, stress level and the fact he was a benefactor to the police department.
And in Ferguson, Missouri, you have a police shooting — ruled justified by investigators — occurring in a town that the Justice Department determined “was deliberately, outright, straight-up racist,” Alexander said.
You have three different shootings involving a white officer and black victim, yet they involve wholly different sets of circumstances, he said.
It’s also important to remember that there are far more good police officers than bad ones, and just like the media has failed to tell the stories about police violence against minorities, “there are officers out jumping in front of bullets and doing the right thing, and those stories aren’t being told as well.”
“Don’t paint your whole police department as bad guys,” Alexander said. “I support police, but the bad ones, we need to go in and pull those guys out. We need police, and police need community, and there’s a lot of good cops doing good work out there everyday.”
Bogle, The Tribune CEO, agreed, saying, “Just like there are some bad police, there are bad people out there, no doubt, that need to be taken off our streets.”
He’d like to see people participating more in surveillance and crime prevention in their neighborhoods, while police should receive more training and return to a community-oriented model, he said.
“There needs to be training because we’re not going to end how people feel about each other,” he said. “We need a good, strong police force, but we don’t need them adding to the problem because they don’t understand who is living in these communities.”
Yet no matter how much people participate and how many policing reforms are enacted, the American public is fickle and “law enforcement, by nature, is contentious, not just in the black community,” Klinger said.
Just as support for the death penalty spikes during periods of high crime in the country, that support drops when crime is down, Klinger said. He suspects police use of force follows a similar pattern.
“Everybody loved the cops on September 12,” he said.
