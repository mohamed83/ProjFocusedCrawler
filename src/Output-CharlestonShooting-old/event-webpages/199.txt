2 Killed, 7 Injured In High-Speed Crash In Robbins; Drag Racing Suspected




CHICAGO (CBS) —
 Chicago Police say an officer shot and killed a man on the city’s South Side early Sunday morning.


WBBM Newsradio’s Steve Miller reports, around 5 a.m. Sunday, two male officers from the Gresham District saw a man running near 79th Street and Vincennes Avenue, and the man was carrying a black object in his hands.


Fraternal Order of Police Spokesman Pat Camden says when police tried to stop him, he ran, and one of the officers chased on foot, the other pursued in the marked police car.

In the 400 block of West Winneconna Parkway, the officer in the car stopped the suspect in a driveway.


“And all of a sudden the offender is running towards him.  He now takes a gun out of the knit cap that he’s carrying, and he’s pointing it at the officer running at him.  The officer, in defense of his life, opens fire,” Camden said.


Camden says one officer fired several shots and killed the man – who Camden says was in his 20s.


Camden says a gun was recovered at the scene.


He says the man who was shot was wearing rubber gloves.


The police officers were not injured, Camden says.


The Independent Police Review Authority was investigating the shooting.
