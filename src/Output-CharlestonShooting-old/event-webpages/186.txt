CHICAGO (STMW) —
 Chicago Police shot and wounded a male who allegedly pointed a gun at officers Thursday evening in the South Side Fuller Park neighborhood.


Police shot and wounded a person in the 4400 block of South Princeton Avenue about 6:40 p.m., according to a statement from police News Affairs.


Paramedics took the male to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Fire Media Affairs Director Larry Langford said. His injury was not thought to be life-threatening.


Area Central Gun Team officers saw two “suspicious males” near the mouth of an alley in the 4400 block of South Princeton and were approaching them to conduct an interview when the males ran away, police said.


The males separated during a foot chase, according to the statement. One of them was allegedly wielding a gun and ran north down the east alley of Princeton. He pointed the gun at the officers pursuing him, at which point the officers opened fire and shot him, police said.


He was arrested and taken to Stroger Hospital, authorities said. The other suspect was located a short time later and also taken into custody.


According to Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden, the incident began after officers saw a man hand something to another man in an alleyway near 45th Street and Portland Avenue.


When police approached, one of the men took off running and officers could see a silver handgun in his hand, Camden said.


The man allegedly turned and shot at the officers who returned fire, striking him in the leg, Camden said. Authorities eventually found him hiding behind a building and took him into custody.


The men, both in their 20s, are in custody, Camden said. No officers were injured in the incident.


Area Central detectives and the Independent Police Review Authority are investigating.
