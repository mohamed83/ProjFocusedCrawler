Church security a consideration after deadly South Carolina shooting

GREENSBORO, N.C. – As the nation grieves for the people in Charleston, churches in the Piedmont are being forced to think about security.


It’s a difficult topic for many churches that want to demonstrate being a place of faith and not fear.


However, one Piedmont man who specializes in church security says the state of the world has local pastors weighing their options.


“The church wants to have that open-door policy and that creates vulnerability in and of itself,” said Greg Leimone, president of Sentinel Consulting Group.


Leimone is a former Greensboro police officer and also served as a security specialist for a FEMA disaster response team.


His company works with a variety of businesses, but also helps local churches build security plans.


“It’s a terrible incident,” Leimone said. “It’s just a time for mourning and prayer for the families, but security is everyone’s responsibility.”


Leimone’s current project is working with a church in High Point to have a strategic plan that includes a lockdown procedure.


“Sunday service, an armed subject comes into the building, how do we evacuate Sunday School, those who are in mass, those who are in meetings in the prayer room, we’ve got nursery going on, how do you manage that?” he asked hypothetically.


He admits the idea of welcoming security is a tough balance.


“Some are very aloof and standoffish about it. They don’t want to feel restricted.”


“We can’t lock it down like Fort Knox,” he added.


Leimone says oftentimes the greatest barrier for churches investing in security is a lack of funding.


Leimone’s hope is that while the world prays for the congregation in Charleston, pastors everywhere will start having conversations with their own members.

Multiple fatalities reported after shooting at historic black church in Charleston, S.C.


 



By Ed Payne
CNN


(CNN) — [Latest developments]
— An official close to the investigation told CNN there are multiple fatalities inside the church. The source said there are several bodies in the church that have not yet been identified.
— The suspect in the shooting is a clean-shaven white man in his 20s, with a slender build, police say.
— Police are asking anyone with information about the shooting to call 911 dispatchers.
[Full story]
Several people were killed in a shooting at an historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina, a source close to the investigation told CNN.
The shooter is still at large.
The shooting took place Wednesday evening at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. On its website, the church describes itself as the “oldest AME church in the South.”
“It’s really bad. It’s a very bad scene,” local pastor Thomas Dixon said.
“Apparently the person just entered the church and opened fire. That part has not been fully articulated on what happened yet … they are still looking for the suspect.”
Search on for suspect
Police haven’t said how many people have been shot. But the source who spoke to CNN said several bodies were in the church that were yet to be identified.
Police said the suspect in the shooting is a clean-shaven white man in his 20s, with a slender build. He was wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and boots.
Soon afterward, news camera showed officers taking a man matching that description into custody, but police said they were still looking for the shooter.
The department asked anyone with information about the shooting to call 911 dispatchers
Heavy police presence
Every Wednesday evening, the church holds a Bible study in its basement.
Corey Wessenger, who was standing across the street from the church, said the area was swarming with law enforcement.
“I just saw a group of about 40 people escorted by cops,” Wessenger told CNN by phone.
Community members gathered in a prayer circle just down the street from the scene.
Patrick Wright, a reporter with WFMY News, tweeted, “We’ve been told not to leave our restaurant here in #Charleston for the time being. Helicopter still circling above.”
