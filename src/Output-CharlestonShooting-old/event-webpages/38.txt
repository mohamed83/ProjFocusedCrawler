HENRICO COUNTY, Va. — A message written by Gospel musician Marcus Stanley and posted to Dylann Roof’s Facebook page is going viral.


He posted the message that include the phrase “I love you Dylann” while Roof was on the run after allegedly murdering nine people at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.


Give your heart to Jesus and confess your sins with a heart of forgiveness. He is the only one that can save your soul and forgive you for the terrible acts you’ve done. I love you Dylann, even in the midst of darkness and pain you’ve caused.


The Henrico County man told WTVR
 that he prayed that his words posted on Roof’s Facebook page would reach the suspected killer. According to the message, Stanley encouraged the suspected shooter to take responsibility for the shooting and try to make amends with God.


Marcus Stanley’s posts message on Dylan Roof’s Facebook page.


Years ago, Stanley was shot eight times at point blank range by a gang member and was left to die. Stanley said his own story of survival is a testimony to what he knows God can do.


Stanley told WTVR that he knew his message was something many people would not understand, but encouraged people to stop attacking and instead reach out with love.

KINGS MOUNTAIN, N.C. (June 18, 2015) — The woman who spotted the car driven by the suspect in Wednesday night’s church shootings in Charleston, South Carolina, says God brought him to her attention.
Debbie Dills says she was on her way to work in North Carolina, singing and praying for the nine people who were killed, when she thought she recognized the car and driver she’d seen on the news.
She called her boss, who contacted police and then stayed in contact with her as she followed the suspect. Police responded quickly and arrested 21-year-old Dylann Roof.
Dills says the Lord “knew he needed to be caught” and she’s sure that “it was divine intervention.”
