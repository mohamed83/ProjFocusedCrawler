South Carolina lost a pillar of its political and religious communities Wednesday when a gunman opened fire on a Charleston church.
Clementa Pinckney, the pastor of Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, is among the nine people who were killed in a massacre Wednesday night. His death is rocking Democratic political circles from Charleston to Washington and Columbia, where he was a member of the state House of Representatives.
"Michelle and I know several members of the Emanuel AME church," President Barack Obama said Thursday. "We knew their pastor, Rev. Clementa Pinckney who, along with eight others, gathered in prayer and fellowship and was murdered last night. And to say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families and their community doesn't say enough to convey the heartache and sadness and the anger that we feel."

President Barack Obama delivers the eulogy for South Carolina state Sen. Clementa Pinckney on Friday, June 26. Pinckney was a pastor at the Charleston, South Carolina, church where 
he and eight other people were fatally shot
 on June 17. Pinckney was 41 years old. "We are here today to remember a man of God who lived by faith," Obama said. "A man who believed in things not seen. A man who believed there were better days ahead, off in the distance. A man of service who persevered knowing full well he would not receive all those things he was promised, because he believed his efforts would provide a better life for those who followed."

Prominent Republicans were also shocked by Pinckney's death.
During an emotional interview, U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, whose congressional district includes the Charleston area, remembered Pickney, a 41-year-old married father of two, as a "remarkable human being."
"I cannot say enough good things about Clementa," Sanford, who is also a former South Carolina GOP governor, told CNN's New Day.
Pinckney's death comes as South Carolina politics heat up in advance of the state's crucial presidential primary early next year. Pinckney was an Obama surrogate in 2012. Gearing up for the next race, Hillary Clinton was in nearby North Charleston on Wednesday, though it's unclear that she crossed paths with Pinckney.
Baraki Sellers, who served in the legislature with Pinckney, said the pastor was especially interested in presidential candidates addressing income inequality heading into 2016.

Pinckney was also pressing to get a port built in his district.
"It would have brought jobs to the region and the economic impact would have changed the course of history for that area," Sellers said. "It would have lifted generations out of poverty."
The legacies of both Pinckney and Emanuel's -- as the church is known -- are rich with the use of faith to influence policy. 
According to the Charleston Post and Courier, Pinckney comes from four generations of pastors including an uncle who sued Gov. John C. West over voting rights and a great grandfather who sued the state Democratic Party to end whites-only primaries.

Emanuel hosted Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during the height of the Civil Rights Movement and the Church was founded by former slaves following an unsuccessful slave revolt.
Pinckney was close with South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn who is the highest ranking African-American member of Congress. They teamed up to bring stimulus money to the Charleston area in 2009.
"This money is really a godsend," 
Pinckney told the Rock Hill Herald
 newspaper. "I am extremely grateful that Congressman Clyburn thought of our area."
On Thursday, Clyburn said his "heart goes out to the victims," including Pinckney.
"I am distraught that this kind of hate still exists in our country and specifically in my home state of South Carolina."

Charleston remembers three more with services for victims of church massacre

Posted 10:42 PM, June 27, 2015, by CNN 

FacebookTwitterRedditPinterestEmailGoogle 






CHARLESTON, S.C. — On this hot, humid Saturday, in Charleston, South Carolina, hundreds of people gathered once more at Emanuel AME Church to pay their respects and say their final farewells to three of the nine people killed in last week’s shooting during a Bible study class. Family, friends, strangers black and white, all came together for “home going” services for Cythia Hurd, Susie Jackson and Tywanza Sanders.
Cynthia Graham Hurd
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has attended all six of the funerals held so far for the victims who’ve come to be known as “the Emanuel Nine,” said 54-year-old Cynthia Hurd was someone she only read about but wishes she had known. ” I love the fact that she said she was inspired by her mom because ‘can’t’ was never in her vocabulary,” Haley told the mourners.
Standing on the pulpit, decorated on both sides with huge matching floral arrangements of colorful, yellow and red flowers, Haley joked that, ” After every service I come to, I’m convinced I’m going to become an AME member after this.”
Hurd’s casket was adorned with a huge spray of pink and burgundy roses. Framing both sides of the casket, were nearly life-sized photos of Hurd from important occasions in her life. Next to the casket — a large, heart-shaped floral wreath dominating the sanctuary, infused with a startling bunch of red roses in the middle, bringing to mind a broken heart.
One after another friends, coworkers and relatives spoke of how loved Hurd was in her community. They spoke of how she never had kids of her own, but “adopted” everyone else’s kids, and of how much her loss had impacted her husband, Steve.
Rev. Jessie Jackson marveled at how the community of Charleston had come together, turning the other cheek and showing love in the face of hatred.
“Cythia Hurd not only taught us how to love, it was her family who taught us how to forgive”, said Haley. “She not only taught us how to love, it was her family who taught us how to forgive” she said.
Susie Jackson and Tywanza Sanders
Almost as soon as one funeral ended, the next began for 26-year-old Tywanza Sanders and his 86-year-old aunt Susie Jackson. They were together at Bible study that fateful night. When the shooting began he jumped up to try to protect his aunt and both were killed. They were remembered together on Saturday.
Both caskets sat before the pulpit — a huge spray of pink flowers on hers and dark purple flowers on his.
There were words of comfort from Charleston Mayor Joesph Riley, who has also attended every funeral. “Within this heartbreaking tragedy” he said “you, the family and this community of prayer have sent a desperately needed message to the world. And that is: you respond to hate with love.”
Referencing the controversy surrounding the Confederate flag, Jackson said there have been efforts to “get it down” for many years. “But, somehow there’s power in the blood” he told the mourners. “And the stained banner of blood brought it down and it will stay down.” Jackson also thanked Haley for saying publicly that it was time for the flag to come down.
Haley spoke again from the pulpit at the funerals of Jackson and Sanders, saying, “It doesn’t matter how many funerals you go, to they’re all hard, because it shouldn’t have happened.”
Haley spoke directly to the families telling them “I’ve struggled through all of these funerals because this happened on my watch. And what I can tell you is we will make this right. They will not have died in vain.”
Three more funerals remain
The funeral for Rev, DePayne Middleton-Doctor, who was 49, is planned for Sunday at 1 p.m. ET, also at Emanuel AME church.
On Monday, Myra Thompson, who was 59 will be laid to rest. Her funeral will take place at Emanuel AME church as well.
Plans have not been announced for the funeral of Rev. Daniel L. Simmons, Sr. who was 74.
