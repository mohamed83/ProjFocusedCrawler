A frustrated Barack Obama appeared almost to run out of words to describe his reaction to the racially charged 
killings
 in Charleston, revealing that he personally knew the pastor of the church and calling again for gun control reforms.

 “To say our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families, and their community doesn’t say enough to convey the heartache and the sadness and the anger that we feel,” said the usually loquacious president in a brief, six-minute White House statement. 


Though less visibly emotional than he had been after the Newtown school shootings in Connecticut, a numbed Obama also sought to differentiate the latest, racially charged, attack as an example of a “particular threat to our democracy”.


“I have had to make statements like this too many times,” he said on Thursday, flanked by a sombre-looking vice-president Joe Biden.


“We don’t have all the facts but we do know that once again innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun,” added Obama.

“At some point we will have to deal with the fact that this kind of mass violence doesn’t happen in other countries and it is in our power to do something about it.”


The president said: “Any death of this sort is a tragedy … Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy. There is something particularly heartbreaking about the death happening in a place in which we seek solace and we seek peace, in a place of worship.”


Though saying he could not comment too much on the ongoing criminal inquiry, the president did not shy away from the political ramifications of the attack.


“The fact that this took place in a black church obviously also raises questions about a dark part of our history. This is not the first time that black churches have been attacked. And we know that hatred across races and faiths pose a particular threat to our democracy and our ideals.”

“The good news is I am confident that the outpouring of unity and strength and fellowship and love across Charleston today, from all races, from all faiths, from all places of worship indicates the degree to which those old vestiges of hatred can be overcome.”


The president also quoted 
Martin Luther King’s response
 to the 1963 bombing of a church in Alabama in which the civil rights leader said: “We must be concerned not just with who murdered them, but the way of life, the philosophy that produced the murderers.”


Obama is estimated to have made 14 such statements in response to mass shootings during his six years as president but failed in his attempt to pass gun control legislation through Congress after Newtown and has also been criticised by some for failing to make a strong enough response to a spate of recent black police shootings.


Later vice-president Biden and his wife Jill put out a joint statement, saying “the senseless actions of a coward have once again cut short so many lives with so much promise”.


“Our hearts ache with sorrow with the entire Emanuel AME Church family as they seek solace and comfort in the shadow of a gunman’s act of pure evil and hatred,” the statement read.


The Bidens said they last saw 
Clementa Pinckney
, the pastor and state senator who was one of those killed in the attack, less than a year ago at a prayer breakfast in Columbia. “He was a good man, a man of faith, a man of service who carried forward Mother Emaunel’s legacy as a sacred place promoting freedom, equality, and justice for all. We pray for him and his sister as we do for the seven other innocent souls who entered that storied church for their weekly Bible study seeking nothing more than humble guidance for the full lives ahead of them.”


The statement also called for gun control. “We have no doubt the coward who committed this heinous act will be brought to justice. But as a nation we must confront the ravages of gun violence and the stain of hatred that continues to be visited on our streets, in our schools, in our houses of worship, and in our communities.”

  US newsWhat happened at the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting? On Wednesday 17 June nine people were shot dead during a bible study group at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church.CCTV footage released by police shows a man identified as 21-year-old Dylann Roof entering the church at 20:17 EDT. Witnesses said he spent around fifty minutes inside with the group before opening fire and then driving away. Was the suspect arrested? Dylann Roof was stopped in his car and arrested, following a tip-off, on Thursday 18 June in the city of Shelby, North Carolina around 400 km north-west of Charleston.During the manhunt police described him as “highly dangerous” and said they had “no doubt” the shooting was a hate crime.  What do we know about the suspect? Roof is from the town of Eastover, around 150 km north-west of Charleston. According to the state law enforcement division, he was arrested on 1 March 2015 for drug possession and again on 26 April on a trespassing charge.Roof’s uncle told Reuters he recognised his nephew from the CCTV image (above) and that he had received a gun for his 21st birthday in April. A photograph from Roof’s Facebook page shows him wearing a jacket with the historical flags of apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) on it. Who has died? Six women and three men were killed including 41-year-old Clementa Pinckney (pictured), the church pastor and a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate. He had campaigned for police to wear body cameras after Walter Scott, a black man, was shot dead in April by a police officer in the adjacent city of North Charleston as he tried to run away. Pinckney’s sister was also said to have died at the church. Three people survived the attack   Senator Pinckney was my friend for over 20 years. I’m speechless, heartbroken and angry. God grant his family some peace right now – South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford How many hate crime incidents have been reported in the United States? According to the most recent FBI statistics, there were a total of 3,407 hate crimes motivated by race in 2013. Why is this church significant? The Emanuel AME church has one of the largest black congregations south of Baltimore and a history entwined with that of race relations and the civil rights struggle in the US. It traces its roots back to 1816 and was burnt by white landowners in 1822 after one of its founders, Denmark Veysey, tried to organise a slave revolt. The Reverend Martin Luther King addressed the church in 1962 while in 1969 his wife, Coretta Scott King, led a 1,500-person march in support of striking hospital workers to the church where they faced bayonet-wielding members of the South Carolina National Guard  What is Charleston’s racial makeup? The racial breakdown of the peninsula has shifted since 1980, from roughly two-thirds black to two-thirds white in 2010. The historic black church now lies within a mostly white area of the city Charleston Mostly black 2010 data from US Census Bureau Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church Drum Island Number of incidents in 2013 F E D C B A A | 2,263, Attacks on Black or African Americans  B | 728, White  C | 146, American Indian or Alaska Native D | 158, Asian E | 109, Multiple Races, Group  F | 3, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander  Senator Pinckney was my friend for over 20 years.
