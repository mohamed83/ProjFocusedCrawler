JENNINGS, Mo. (PIX11)
 — Police in St. Louis are investigating the shooting death of a 23-year-old man who was shot while allegedly charging at an officer with a knife Friday night, 
KTVI reported
.


The incident occurred in a residential neighborhood in Jennings, where police responded to a 911 call of a man who barricaded himself in a house with access to knives and a Samurai sword. Thaddeus McCarroll’s worried mother was locked out and wanted her son to be removed from the home, calling his behavior “not normal.”


The first officers on the scene were unsuccessful in their attempts to coax McCarroll out of the house around 10:30 p.m. It took hours of negotiations for him to emerge from the home with a Bible in one hand and a knife in the other.


SWAT team members gave verbal commands for McCarroll to drop the knife, but he continued to approach police instead. They then fired a rubber bullet, which struck him in the leg, but McCarroll continued to close in on two officers with the knife still in his hand.


The officers then shot him several times.


A medic tried to revive McCarroll, but he died at the scene.




The St. Louis Police Department released video from the scene, taken from body cameras worn by officers involved in the incident.


In July 2014, police responded to a 911 call involving McCarroll in a state of mental distress. He was able to be subdued and taken in for professional treatment in that incident.

Funeral plans are being announced for Clementa Pinckney, the South Carolina state senator who was one of nine people killed in the shooting spree at a Charleston church on 17 June.
A spokesman for Leevy’s funeral home in Columbia confirmed the details to the State newspaper.
Pinckney’s casket will be at the State House, the South Carolina legislature, for public viewing on Wednesday afternoon, according to the funeral listing, with additional public viewings on Thursday at a Columbia church and at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church where Pinckney was shot.
The funeral is set for 11am on Friday at TD Arena on the College of Charleston campus.
Dylann Roof is charged with nine counts of murder in the apparently racially motivated killing of Pinckney and the other victims.

On Saturday, hundreds of protesters walked down the streets of Charleston chanting “black lives matter” and “we can’t take it no more”.
In the evening a large crowd demonstrated against the presence of the Confederate flag on the grounds of the State House, where Pinckney’s casket is to lie in state. Calling the flag a symbol of hatred not heritage, the protesters chanted “take it down” in a rally that ended with a chorus of civil rights anthem “We Shall Overcome”.
Police say 21-year-old Roof went to the church and joined a Bible study group, then opened fire.
