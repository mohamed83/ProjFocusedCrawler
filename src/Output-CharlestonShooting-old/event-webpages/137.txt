 Known as "Mother Emanuel" by those who love her, the Charleston church that was the site of 
Wednesday's horrific shooting 
holds a central place in African-American history. 


 One of the largest and oldest black congregations in the South, Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church's roots reach back to 1816 when black church members withdrew from predominantly white Charleston's Methodist Episcopal Church "over disputed burial ground," 
according its website
. 


 "It's not just a church. It's also a symbol … of black freedom," Robert Greene, who studies the 20th century South at the University of South Carolina, told the Washington Post. "It's a church that represents so much about the rich history and tradition of African Americans in Charleston."

 Under the leadership of Morris Brown, a free shoemaker, organizers established the church for people of color. 


 Six years after it's founding, the church was burned down when one of its ministers and founders, Denmark Vesey, was discovered as he tried to organize a major slave revolt.

 "The plot created mass hysteria throughout the Carolinas and the South" and Vesey was hanged, according to Emanuel's website. The congregation was then forced to worship underground after black churches were outlawed altogether in Charleston in 1834. 


 "The black church experiment was not to be repeated in the southern city until after the Civil War," according to 
educational website The Social Welfare History Project

Charleston shooting impacts Missouri governor’s race


 


ST. LOUIS COUNTY, MO (KTVI) – The aftermath of Wednesday’s deadly church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina is having an affect on the 2016 race for governor here in the Show-Me State.
South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, a star in the Republican Party since her election there in 2011, was to be the headliner at a fundraiser for Catherine Hanaway, a GOP contender for Missouri governor, Thursday night in west St. Louis County. That event was postponed after Wednesday’s shooting.
Haley was in Charleston Thursday to meet with local officials, all trying to help that community come to grips with the deaths of nine people at Emanuel A.M.E. Church. A suspect was apprehended in North Carolina Thursday morning.
News of the impact on the Hanaway event was first reported by PoliticMO.
A campaign spokesman tells FOX2 the event, with Governor Haley’s participation, will be rescheduled. Hanaway is in a crowded primary field that includes State Senator Mike Parson and former State Rep. Randy Asbury. St. Louis businessman John Brunner, former Navy SEAL Eric Greitens, and Lt. Governor Peter Kinder are all exploring entry into a race that has been of national interest since State Auditor Tom Schweich, an early front-runner, took his own life this spring.

 The faithful did not waste time after the end of the Civil War and in 1865 the name Emanuel was formerly recognized. The present church was built in 1891 by African Americans. 


 Emanuel A.M.E. is part of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the world's oldest Christian denomination founded by African Americas. 


 "The church was born in protest against slavery — against the dehumanization of the African people brought to the American continent as labor," according to A.M.E.'s website.

 Civil rights icon and co-founder of the NAACP W.E.B. du Bois called the A.M.E. Church a "social center of astonishing efficiency, where the poor and ostracized met in human sympathy, mutual charity and encouragement, to fight the battle of life." 


 President Barack Obama referenced the church in his remarks Thursday from the White House. "It has risen from flames, an earthquake and other dark times," he said. "It will rise again now as a place of peace."
