 The slaying of nine people at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, by a white gunman has reignited one of the state's most racially charged debates: taking down the Confederate flag for good. 


 Calls for the rebel banner's removal at the statehouse have grown on social media after it was left 
to fly at full staff
 this week — even after two flags atop the capitol were lowered in honor of the victims. 


 South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has since suggested that it might be time to revisit the flag controversy again in "thoughtful words." But for many, the argument over whether to pull it permanently remains rooted in a deeper divide: Is it a symbol of Southern heritage or enduring hate?

 State Rep. Christopher Hart told NBC News he gets emotional when he drives past the statehouse and sees the Confederate flag hoisted up high. 


 "You're at the stoplight and you have to see it fly right at your face, and it's disgusting," Hart said.

 The Democratic lawmaker has tried repeatedly since he joined the General Assembly in 2006 to have the flag removed, but he said his bills don't even get out of subcommittee because of opposition from the Republican majority. 


 A previous push to get the Confederate battle flag scrubbed from the statehouse, where it's been since 1962, ended with a compromise in 2000. The flag was taken from the top of the capitol dome and placed elsewhere on the grounds at a Confederate war memorial.

 The move came after the NAACP threatened the state with boycotts. 




"I'm a product of the South. Who's heritage is it? It's not my heritage."




 This time, the 
horrific murders
 at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on Wednesday night have once again put a spotlight on the flag. The suspected shooter, Dylann Roof, drove a car bearing a license plate featuring the Confederate symbol. 


 After the shooting, the Confederate flag at the statehouse was left flying at full staff because the General Assembly is out of session, and state law requires any changes dictating how the flag is flown to be approved by the lawmakers. They would also have the authority on whether the flag is taken down permanently. 


 The General Assembly must wait until January to take up the issue again, said Antjuan Seawright, political adviser to the Senate Democratic Caucus.

 The Confederate controversy became a campaign issue last year, when Haley, a Republican, ran against Democratic Sen. Vince Sheheen for South Carolina governor. Sheheen held a news conference calling for the flag's removal in a state "too often separated by race, by region, by party." 


 Haley said at the time that the flag wasn't an issue, but she suggested during an interview Friday on "CBS This Morning" that "the state will start talking about that again." Her office didn't immediately respond to NBC News for comment.

[Update 8:34 a.m] A woman who survived the church shooting says the gunman told her he was letting her live so that she could tell people what happened there, Charleston NAACP President Dot Scott told CNN. Scott said she heard this from the woman’s family.
Update [7:19 a.m.] There were three survivors in Wednesday evening’s shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston police Chief Greg Mullen said Thursday morning.
Three males and six females were killed in the shooting, he said.
Original story 
CHARLESTON, S.C. — Police released photos of the suspect in the Charleston church shooting that’s being investigated as a hate crime.
The suspect is in his early 20s and is approximately 5 feet 9 inches tall.
“He has on a very distinctive sweatshirt as well as the vehicle, with a very distinctive license plate,” Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said.
Police said they believe he is still in the Charleston area.
“This is an all hands on deck effort with the community as well as law enforcement,” Mullen said. “When people go out they should be vigilant, they should be aware of their surroundings. And if they see anything suspicious, they should call law enforcement.”

Full Story 
A white man walked into a historic African-American church in Charleston, S.C., and opened fire during a Bible study class, killing nine people Wednesday evening.
The suspect was still at large early Thursday morning. And the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the oldest AME church in the South, is being investigated as a hate crime.
“The only reason someone would walk into a church and shoot people that were praying is hate,” said Charleston Mayor Joe Riley.
Eight churchgoers died at the scene; a ninth at a hospital, police said. Among them is the church’s pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, according to CNN affiliate WCSC.
Officials wouldn’t say how many people were at the Bible study during the shooting. There were survivors,  Mullen said, but he didn’t elaborate.
Historic significance
Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church has been a presence in Charleston since 1816 when African-American members of Charleston’s Methodist Episcopal Church formed their own congregation after a dispute over burial grounds.
It was burned to the ground at one point, but rebuilt. Over and over throughout its history, it overcame obstacle after obstacle — destroyed by an earthquake, banned by the state. But its church members persevered, making it the largest African-American church in terms of seating space in Charleston today.
Every Wednesday evening, the church holds a Bible study in its basement.
The shooting was “obviously the most intolerable and unbelievable act possible,” the mayor said.
“People in prayer Wednesday evening. A ritual, a coming together, praying, worshiping God. An awful person come in and shoot them is inexplicable,” Riley said.
Police received the first call around 9:05 p.m. Officers arrived to find several victims inside.
“It’s really bad. It’s a very bad scene,” local pastor Thomas Dixon said.
Search on for suspect
Police said the suspect in the shooting is a clean-shaven white man in his early 20s, 5 feet 9 inches tall, with a slender build and sandy blonde hair. He was wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and Timberland boots.
“He obviously is extremely dangerous,” Chief Mullen said.
Thursday morning, police handed out images of the man and his vehicle taken from surveillance footage and asked for the public’s help in identifying the man. Officials believe he is still in the Charleston area, but have contacted law enforcement authorities elsewhere to be on the lookout.
“This is an all hands on deck effort with the community as well as law enforcement,” Mullen said. “When people go out they should be vigilant, they should be aware of their surroundings. And if they see anything suspicious, they should call law enforcement.”
Late Wednesday night, news cameras showed officers taking a man matching that description into custody, but he was later released.
“While we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another,” South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said.
Mullen was more direct: “I do believe this was a hate crime.”
‘Sick to our stomachs’
The church sits in an area of Charleston densely packed with houses of worship and well-preserved old buildings.
The city, as several reverends pointed out, is known as the “Holy City” for its tolerant attitude toward different denominations.
The church was led by Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was also a state senator. His death was reported by affiliate WCSC, who confirmed it through Elder James Johnson, the president of the Tri-County chapter of the civil rights organization, the National Action Network.
Recently, Pinckney backed a bill to make body cameras mandatory for all police officers in South Carolina. The legislation was in response to the death of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man killed by a police officer earlier this year.
“Body cameras help to record what happens. It may not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but it helps to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop,” Pinckney said in April.
Early Thursday morning, residents stood in circles, hands clasped and heads bowed, as they prayed.
“Like everybody out here, we’re sick to our stomachs that this could happen in a church,” Rep. Dave Mack, a friend of the church’s pastor, said.
They called for justice, but also for calm heads.
Theirs is a strong community, they said, and this incident wouldn’t tear them apart.
The head of the NAACP expressed his outrage over the shooting.
“There is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people engaged in the study of scripture,” Cornell William Brooks said.
Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush canceled a scheduled town hall in Charleston on Thursday because of the shooting.
“As the Charleston police deem this horrific act a hate crime,” the King Center tweeted, “we pray vigorously that this person’s hate does not cultivate more hate.”

 Some prominent South Carolina politicians were outspoken on the issue Friday. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican presidential candidate, said the problem is with the gunman, not the flag. 


 U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, a Charleston Republican and former governor, said resurfacing the issue could end up being a "Pandora's box." 


 But Seawright said he anticipates a "growing choir" demanding change. Such a movement could be bolstered by the 
Supreme Court ruling this week
 that Texas cannot be required to allow the Confederate flag on car license plates. 


 But across the country, a recent 
NBC News online survey conducted by SurveyMonkey
 found that Americans remain evenly divided over what the Confederate flag represents. About half of those surveyed see it as a symbol of racism, while the other half sees it as a symbol of Southern pride. 


 


Take down the 
#ConfederateFlag
 at the SC Capitol. To many, it is a symbol of racial hatred. Remove it now to honor 
#Charleston
 victims.
— Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) 
June 20, 2015
 


 Lee Wilson, vice president of the Confederate Heritage Trust in South Carolina, which organizes Civil War reenactments, puts himself in the second camp. 


 "Our history and heritage is really important to us," Wilson said. The Civil War "is an event that happened. It was bad for a lot of people — whites and blacks died during the war between the states." 


 But South Carolinians such as Hart don't buy the heritage argument. 


 "I'm a product of the South. Whose heritage is it? It's not my heritage. It's not Southern to me," Hart said. "There were hundreds of black soldiers in the Civil War, but you don't see black people walking around with Confederate flags now."

 Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a prominent black member of Congress, told NBC News that South Carolina didn't have to be a battle ground over the battle flag — if a certain compromise had been reached in 2000 to place the Confederate flag at the backside of the capitol grounds. Still, he would like to see it taken down now. 


 "It's long past time, and I think that we ought to remove it," Clyburn said. "Not because of what happened in Charleston, because it has no place having any appearance of sovereignty."
