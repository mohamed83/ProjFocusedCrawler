Three months before the deadly shooting rampage at Charleston’s historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church that killed nine people, Dylann Roof was questioned by a Columbia police officer who found AR-15 magazines in his trunk, according to a police document released on Friday.


Roof was spotted on 13 March loitering in his car in a Columbia park by an off-duty police officer. It was the same officer who had arrested Roof a month earlier at a Columbia mall on a misdemeanor charge of possessing the drug Suboxone, a narcotic used to wean people from opiate addiction, the police report said.


The officer who arrived at the scene asked Roof why he was in the park and asked if he could search the car. Roof agreed and the officer found six 40-round magazines as well as part of an AR-15. Roof was questioned, but he was not charged.


The news comes as President Barack Obama prepares to deliver the eulogy in Charleston, South Carolina, for the 
Rev Clementa Pinckney
, the pastor of Emanuel AME church who was one of those killed last week.


Roof, 21, has been charged with nine counts of murder in connection with the deadly attack at the Charleston church. Police say he used a .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun in the attack. Friends say Roof bought the gun in April with money he got for his birthday.

Prominent black South Carolina church burns; feds investigating

Posted 8:41 PM, June 30, 2015, by Associated Press, Updated at 11:19pm, June 30, 2015

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Firefighters were trying Tuesday night to extinguish a blaze at a prominent black church in South Carolina.

State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel said the Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal church in Williamsburg County caught fire Tuesday night.
The church was burned down by the Ku Klux Klan in 1995, but Keel says it is too early to say what the cause of Tuesday night’s blaze is. He said there were thunderstorms with frequent lightning in the area.

Keel says officials at the scene don’t’ think anyone was inside when the fire started.
Williamsburg County Councilman Eddie Woods Jr. drove to the scene and says the blaze was so intense people were being kept several hundred yards away.
Federal authorities are investigating several recent fires at predominantly black churches, though the blazes do not appear to be related.
