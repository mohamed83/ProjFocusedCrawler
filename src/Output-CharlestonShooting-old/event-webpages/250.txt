Police arrest 3 suspect in crime spree


 


ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – An elderly woman was one of three victims of armed robbers during an early morning crime spree across St. Louis Monday morning.
According to police, it began at 6:00 am when a group of young men robbed a man at gunpoint in the 3700 block of North Euclid in the Penrose neighborhood of North St. Louis. The suspects fled in a white car.
At 6:25 am police say those same robbers traveling in that same white car robbed a man walking a dog in the 4900 block of Sunshine in the Princeton Heights neighborhood. They took his cell phone and wallet.
Five minutes later, police say the group struck one more time in the 4600 block of Tyrolean, robbing at gunpoint a 76 year old woman sitting on her steps waiting for a friend. In that case, the suspects allegedly took her purse, hitting her once in the face with the gun when she initially refused to give it to them.
With the help of a tipster and a description of the car and partial license plate from one of the victims, police were able to find it by 7 am in the 4800 block of Kossuth.
Charged with Robbery First Degree and Armed Criminal Action are: Nicholas Bryant, 23, of the 5800 block of St. Louis Avenue, Derrick Mason, 19, of the 4800 block of Sacramento, and Cory Thomas, 19, of the 5700 block of Roosevelt.
