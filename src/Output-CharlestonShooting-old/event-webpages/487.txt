SACRAMENTO —
Around 3:20 a.m. Tuesday morning a Sacramento State Police officer was flagged down by a woman who reported her daughter had been taken or gone with a Hispanic male in his mid-twenties.
The woman said the male had sexual intercourse with her 16-year-old daughter at different locations in Sacramento.
The victim said she first came in contact with the suspect around midnight at the south end of the Sacramento State campus near the Capital Public Radio building.
She said he drove her around until dropping her off around 3:00 a.m. near the college campus.
The male is further described as close to 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, with short black hair and a black mustache.
He was driving a white four-door police-type sedan with grey leather interior.
The Sacramento Police Department asks anyone with possible information call (916) 278-6000.
