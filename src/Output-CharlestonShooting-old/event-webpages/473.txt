Official: Police shoot, kill suspect in south Chicago suburb


 


HARVEY, Ill. (AP) _ A spokesman the southern Chicago suburb of Harvey says police have shot and killed a robbery suspect who fired a weapon at officers in a church parking lot.
Harvey spokesman Sean Howard says the suspect was shot in the head by an officer Sunday afternoon outside St. John the Baptist Catholic Church, where he says about 200 people were gathered in a fellowship hall.
Howard says officers had pursued the man following the report of an armed robbery at a dollar store. He says the suspect fled the store on foot and went inside the church about two blocks away, trying to hide cash inside a bathroom.
After running back outside, Howard says the man was confronted by an officer and pointed a weapon at police, firing it “at least twice.”
