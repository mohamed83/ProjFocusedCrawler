A North Carolina florist is being hailed a hero after alerting police when she spotted the suspected gunman Dylann Storm Roof’s car early on Thursday and then tailing him until authorities arrived.
Debbie Dills was driving to work on Thursday through Shelby, North Carolina – about four hours’ drive from Charleston – when she spotted a black Hyundai with a South Carolina plate and a confederate flag.
“There was just something inside of me that said it just didn’t look right to me,” she said.
When she pulled up alongside, she saw the driver’s blond bowl haircut and immediately called her boss, Todd Frady.
“I think this is the guy from Charleston who shot the people. I’m right beside him,” she told Frady.
Frady called the King’s Mountain police and Dills pulled in close to identify the licence plate.
She then tailed the car for 56km (35 miles), still not entirely sure he was the young man police had been hunting for 14 hours.
“Everything inside of me said it’s possible, but everything inside of me didn’t want to believe it either,” she said.
King’s Mountain police arrived within 15 minutes and arrested Roof, who did not resist. 
“It was God who made this happen,” she said of the credit she received. “It don’t have nothing to do with Debbie. It don’t have nothing to do with Todd. It’s all about him.
“He answered the prayers of those people who were praying in Charleston last night, who were holding hands and praying.”

The FBI is investigating a website that appears to contain a manifesto by the white supremacist Dylann Roof, who is suspected of shooting dead nine black churchgoers in 
South Carolina
.

The provenance of the website, which contains a cache of photographs of the 21-year-old, some in which he holds firearms and others in which he stands beside the Confederate flag, has not been confirmed.


However federal agents are investigating the website, a law enforcement source has told the Guardian. The FBI is preparing a statement for public release imminently.


The website also contains what appears to be a manifesto that, if authentic, would shed light on the thoughts that led Roof to massacre black worshippers at a Bible study group at the Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday.


The apparent manifesto states: “I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight.


“I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. 


“Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.”

The author also writes that they were “truly awakened” by the case of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was killed by George Zimmerman in Florida three years ago.


Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch leader, was acquitted of murdering the 17-year-old teenager but the case became a touchstone for debates over racial discrimination in the US.


“It was obvious that Zimmerman was in the right,” the author of the manifesto writes on a website that Roof appears to have created, entitled Last Rhodesian. “But more importantly this prompted me to type in the words ‘black on white crime’ into Google, and I have never been the same since that day.”


The website, which is filled with offensive racist diatribe, also contains 60 photographs, 34 of which are of Roof. In one picture, he is shown burning an American flag. In four others, he is either holding or surrounded by the Confederate flag.


Data embedded in the images suggests they were mostly taken in recent months. However one, in which Roof photographs himself in a mirror, appears to have been taken at 2.45pm on Wednesday, less than six hours before he arrived at the Emanuel church.


The website appears to have been created in February, with the registrant’s name given as Dylann Roof.
