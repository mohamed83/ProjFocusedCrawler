Man Suspected in String of South Sacramento Liquor Store Burglaries

SOUTH SACRAMENTO —
It turns out the third time wasn’t the charm for a suspect believed to be behind a string of burglaries in South Sacramento.
Police have identified the suspect as 29-year-old Zachary Chapman.
“What he had done, is he removed the air conditioning unit, and he made his way into the sub-floor of the roof,” Sacramento police Sgt. Dustin Smith said.
The store’s owners said the suspect allegedly cut two holes in the roof of the business, lowered in his ladder and then climbed down into the store.
“They have been taking alcohol, cigarettes and scratchers,” Smith said.
This was the third liquor store to be burglarized in South Sacramento in the past three weeks.
Pints-N-Fifths Liquors is located on Stockton Boulevard and 48th Street. The other two were on Stockton Boulevard and Fowler Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard.
In all three burglaries, police said a suspect used a ladder and went through the roof. Police said this allowed the suspect to be undetected by people on the street — until Tuesday.
“An alert citizen called and said a male subject took a ladder and put it against the building behind us and crawled up on top of the building and grabbed the ladder and pull it up on top of of roof,” Smith said.
Police quickly responded, surrounded the building and trapped the suspect on the roof.
Officers sent a K9 on the roof with the help of the fire department’s ladder. And within minutes, police had the suspect in custody.
“We wouldn’t be able to do our job without the citizens of this great community we live in, and work in, so without them, we wouldn’t be able to catch people like this,” Smith said.
Police are still waiting to officially link the suspect will all three break-ins, but they do know all three liquor store that were hit had good surveillance video and that the suspect matches the man in the video.
