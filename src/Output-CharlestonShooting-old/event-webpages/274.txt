UPDATED: 6 p.m., 4/6/15 


CHICAGO (CBS/STMW) —
 Autopsy results released Monday afternoon say a Waukegan teen who was shot and killed by Zion police on Saturday was shot in the back.


The Lake County Coroner says 17-year-old Justus Howell was shot twice in the back and one of the bullets penetrated his liver and heart, WBBM Newsradio’s Terry Keshner reports.


Saturday’s shooting happened after a Zion officer responded to reports of an argument or fight and a possible gun shot.


According to a statement from the Zion Police Department, officers immediately administered medical assistance to the teen, who was transported to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police also said that they recovered a handgun from the scene.

Also Monday, authorities met with community leaders as a potentially volatile situation unfolded. The invitation-only meeting was held at the Christian Assembly of God Church, CBS 2’s Jim Williams reports. Among the attendees were the Zion police chief and the Lake County state’s attorney.


Representatives of the NAACP’s local chapter also attended and promised to withhold judgment – for now.


“We’re trying to make sure that we get all the facts and let the investigation take its course, and then the NAACP will make a decision based upon that,” Jennifer Witherspoon said.


Zion Community activist Clyde McLemore says the shooting of Howell is reflects the uneasy relationship between Zion police and the African-American community.


“Black lives matter,” McLemore says. “We just went through this with Ferguson (Mo.), and I have been saying that Zion is another Ferguson just waiting to explode.”


The Lake County Major Crimes Task Force and the Lake County State’s Attorney are investigating. WBBM has reached out to the Zion Police Department for comment.


Dozens of family and friends gathered Sunday at the scene of Saturday’s shooting to remember Justus, whom they say was an aspiring rapper.


His mother, LaToya Howell, said Justus wanted to go to medical school to be a surgeon.


“Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police,” she said. “As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn’t have been a threat if he was running.”


Two witnesses said Howell was not armed at the time of the shooting.


Michael Dizzone and his wife live in a home directly across the street from where Howell was shot. Dizzone said his wife was looking out of her bedroom window when she saw and heard the officer shoot Howell twice.


“She saw him fall to the ground,” Dizzone said. He said his wife told police what she saw and that she did not see a gun on or around Howell. “She was really upset.”


Bobbie Vaughn, who lives nearby, said she heard two shots and began running toward the scene, following a police officer. When she arrived, she saw Howell on the ground.


“I heard the officer tell the other officer, ‘I shot him,’ ” she said. “They were shaking him, but he didn’t move. He was on his stomach, so they turned him over and the police officer I was with gave him CPR.”


Vaughn said that she remained on the scene for quite some time and did not see police uncover a weapon.


“I didn’t see a gun, no knife, nothing,” she said.


LaToya Howell said her son would have celebrated his golden birthday on June 18, when they had plans for a big party. The party guests were planning to wear white and gold.


“He was on the path to becoming a man,” she said. “He loved to rap and went by the name ‘Lil’ Meachi.”


Howell’s great aunt, LaDonnia Gilmore, of North Chicago, said she believed that an evil act was committed.


“Justus was a baby in the eyes of many,” she said. “There are more babies dying than seniors. They don’t even have a chance to carry out their careers. We want to make a statement that the police brutality must decrease.”


Tyrece Branch, 17, whose father is engaged to Howell’s mother, ran to the scene Saturday as soon as he heard that Justus, whom he considered his brother, was shot.


“I got a call that Meachi is on the floor and I was like, ‘It can’t be him,’ ” Branch said.


“I got real emotional, real angry,” he said. “He’s been in my life since I was 5 and we were real close.”


The vigil was peaceful as the participants chanted, “Justice for Justus.” Many sported T-shirts with Howell’s picture and the same sentiment. Others just hugged and cried.


While most of the group was made up of family members and friends, some came just because they were angry about what happened to a member of their community.


“You can’t keep killing our black children and not tell us why,” said Vanessa Gibbs, of Zion. “When is this going to stop? I’ve heard too many of these stories and I’m tired.”

Pastor one of the shooting victimsIn the beginningThe congregation first formed in 1791, a coalition of free blacks and slaves. At first they were members of Charleston's Methodist Episcopal Church. But in 1816, they left their white counterparts in a dispute over burial grounds.At the time, the church was 1,400 members strong. They rallied behind the leadership of a pastor named Morris Brown and organized under the banner of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.Burned to the ground The early years of the congregation were fraught with trials as Brown and other ministers of the church were jailed for violating laws that prohibited slaves and free blacks from gathering without white supervision.In 1822, the church was burned to the ground, after plans for a slave revolt were exposed.Denmark Vesey, a carpenter who brought himself out of slavery, was the architect. Since he was one of the founders of the congregation, authorities suspected the church was the meeting place for planning the rebellion.The church was torched in retaliation. Authorities arrested 313 alleged participants, and executed 35, including Vesey. Born again The congregation rebuilt the church and met there until 1834 -- when all-black churches were outlawed by the state legislature.Undeterred, they continued to meet in secret until the end of the Civil War in 1865, when they formally reorganized.They adopted the name 'Emanuel,' meaning "God with us."An earlier configuration of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal ChurchEXPAND IMAGEAt the time, the church was a wooden two-story structure, and it was destroyed in an earthquake in 1886. Once again, it rebuilt. During the civil rights movement of the 1960s, it was a destination stop for many of the leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr. Today, the church -- with its historic Gothic Revival-style structure and signature steeple -- is a fixture in Charleston. With seats for 2,500, it has the largest capacity of any African-American church in Charleston. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Leader of the flockA dynamic church, Emanuel had at its helm an equally dynamic leader. The Rev. Clementa Pinckney was among the nine people killed, according to CNN affiliate WCSC. The affiliate confirmed it through Elder James Johnson, the president of the Tri-County chapter of the civil rights organization, the National Action Network.Pinckney began preaching at 13 and was appointed to his first church at 18.In addition to being the senior pastor at Emanuel AME, Pinckney was also a state senator.  He was elected to the State Senate in 2000 at age 27, according to the church's website.  He made his statehouse debut four years earlier when he was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives.Recently, he backed a bill to make body cameras mandatory for all police officers in South Carolina. The legislation was in response to the death of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man killed by a police officer earlier this year."Body cameras help to record what happens. It may not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but it helps to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop," Pinckney said in April.Who is the shooting suspect?Emanuel A.M.E. shootingAccused church shooter faces more chargesWho were the victims?
