Police video shows killing of black Oklahoma suspect


 


TULSA, Okla. (AP) – Police say a white reserve sheriff’s deputy thought he was holding a stun gun, not his handgun, when he fatally shot a black suspect during an arrest that was caught on video in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The video of the April 2 incident shows a Tulsa County deputy chase and tackle Eric Harris, 44, whom they accuse of trying to sell an illegal gun to an undercover officer.
While the deputy subdues Harris on the ground, a gunshot rings out and a man says, “Oh, I shot him. I’m sorry.”
Authorities have identified the shooter as 73-year-old reserve deputy Robert Bates and say he meant to use his stun gun.
The video was released over the weekend at the request of Harris’ family. They have not commented since its release.
