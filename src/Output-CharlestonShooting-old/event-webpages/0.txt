Shooting reported at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston






 






(CNN) – An official close to the investigation told CNN there are multiple fatalities inside the church. The source said there are several bodies in the church that have not yet been identified.


The suspect in the shooting is a clean-shaven white man in his 20s, with a slender build, police say


Police are asking anyone with information about the shooting to call 911 dispatchers


Several people were killed in a shooting at a historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina, a source close to the investigation told CNN.


The shooter is still at large.


Police in Charleston, South Carolina, are at the scene of a shooting at a downtown church, a local lawmaker told CNN Wednesday night.


There was no immediate information on potential victims.


The shooting took place at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, said State Rep. Wendell G. Gilliard who represents the district where the church is located.


Gilliard didn’t have additional information and said he was on his way to the scene.


Police too have offered little information. The department listed the site of the shooting as 110 Calhoun Street, the location of the church.


On its website, the church describes itself as the “oldest AME church in the south.” Every Wednesday evening, the church holds a Bible study in its basement. Corey Wessenger, who was standing across the street from the church, said the area was swarming with a heavy law enforcement presence.


“I just saw a group about of 40 people escorted by cops,” Wessenger told CNN by phone.

There was a time when citizens could by dynamite and blasting caps at the hardware store to blast tree stumps.  Nobody thought twice about it, and nobody used it to hurt other people.  Those days of human decency are gone.
