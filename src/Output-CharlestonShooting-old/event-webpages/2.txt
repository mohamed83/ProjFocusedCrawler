Charleston church shooting investigated as a hate crime

CHARLESTON, S.C. — A white man walked into a historic African-American church in South Carolina and opened fire during a Bible study class, killing nine people Wednesday evening in what officials are investigating as a hate crime.


The suspected gunman was captured early Thursday, thanks to a tip from a vigilant woman on her way to work who followed the man’s car for some 35 miles until police arrived. Dylan Storm Roof, 21, is accused of opening fire inside Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the oldest AME church in the South.


“The only reason someone would walk into a church and shoot people that were praying is hate,” Charleston Mayor Joe Riley said.


Eight churchgoers died at the scene; a ninth at a hospital, police said. Among them is the church’s pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, according to CNN affiliate WCSC.


Officials wouldn’t say how many people were at the Bible study during the shooting. There were survivors, said Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen, but he didn’t elaborate.


Historic significance


Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church has been a presence in Charleston since 1816, when African-American members of Charleston’s Methodist Episcopal Church formed their own congregation after a dispute over burial grounds.


It was burned to the ground at one point, but rebuilt. Throughout its history, it overcame obstacle after obstacle — destroyed by an earthquake, banned by the state. But its church members persevered, making it the largest African-American church in terms of seating space in Charleston today.


Every Wednesday evening, the church holds a Bible study in its basement.


The shooting was “obviously the most intolerable and unbelievable act possible,” the mayor said.


“People in prayer Wednesday evening. A ritual, a coming together, praying, worshiping God. An awful person to come in and shoot them is inexplicable,” Riley said.


Police received the first call around 9:05 p.m. Officers arrived to find several victims inside.


“It’s really bad. It’s a very bad scene,” local pastor Thomas Dixon said.


 


Sick to our stomachs’


The church sits in an area of Charleston densely packed with houses of worship and well-preserved old buildings.


The city, as several church leaders pointed out, is known as the “Holy City” for its tolerant attitude toward different denominations.


It was led by Pinckney, who was also a state senator. His death was reported by affiliate WCSC, who confirmed it through Elder James Johnson, the president of the Tri-County chapter of the National Action Network civil rights organization.


Recently, Pinckney backed a bill to make body cameras mandatory for all police officers in South Carolina. The legislation was in response to the death of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man killed by a police officer this year.


“Body cameras help to record what happens. It may not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but it helps to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop,” Pinckney said in April.


Early Thursday morning, residents stood in circles, hands clasped and heads bowed, as they prayed.


“Like everybody out here, we’re sick to our stomachs that this could happen in a church,” said Rep. Dave Mack, a friend of the church’s pastor.


They called for justice, but also for calm. Theirs is a strong community, they said, and this incident wouldn’t tear them apart.


The president of the NAACP expressed his outrage over the shooting.


“There is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people engaged in the study of scripture,” Cornell William Brooks said.


Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush canceled a scheduled town hall in Charleston on Thursday because of the shooting.


“As the #Charleston police deem this horrific act a hate crime,” the King Center tweeted, “we pray vigorously that this person’s hate does not cultivate more hate.”

Charleston Church Shooting: 9 Killed in What Officials Call Hate Crime

CHARLESTON, South Carolina —
A white man walked into a historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina, and opened fire during a Bible study class, killing nine people Wednesday evening.
The suspect was still at large early Thursday morning. And the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the oldest AME church in the South, is being investigated as a hate crime.
“The only reason someone would walk into a church and shoot people that were praying is hate,” said Charleston Mayor Joe Riley.
Eight churchgoers died at the scene; a ninth at a hospital, police said.
Officials wouldn’t say how many people were at the prayer service during the shooting. There were survivors, said Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen, but he didn’t elaborate.
Historic significance
Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church has been a presence in Charleton since 1816 when African-American members of Charleston’s Methodist Episcopal Church formed their own congregation after a dispute over burial grounds.
It was burned to the ground at one point, but rebuilt.
Every Wednesday evening, the church holds a Bible study in its basement.
The shooting was “obviously the most intolerable and unbelievable act possible,” the mayor said.
“People in prayer Wednesday evening. A ritual, a coming together, praying, worshiping God. An awful person come in and shoot them is inexplicable,” Riley said.
Police received the first call around 9:05 p.m. Officers arrived to find several victims inside.
“It’s really bad. It’s a very bad scene,” local pastor Thomas Dixon said.
Search on for suspect
Police said the suspect in the shooting is a clean-shaven white man in his 20s, with a slender build. He was wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and boots.
“He obviously is extremely dangerous,” Chief Mullen said. “We will put all our resources, we will put all of our energy in finding this individual.”
The department asked anyone with information to call 911 dispatchers.
“While we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another,” South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said.
Heavy police presence
“Like everybody out here, we’re sick to our stomachs that this could happen in a church,” Rep. Dave Mack, a friend of the church’s pastor, told CNN affiliate WCSC.
Corey Wessenger, who was standing across the street from the church, said the area was swarming with law enforcement.
“I just saw a group of about 40 people escorted by cops,” Wessenger told CNN by phone.
Community members gathered in a prayer circle just down the street from the scene.
Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush canceled a scheduled town hall in Charleston on Thursday “due to the tragic events unfolding in South Carolina tonight.”
