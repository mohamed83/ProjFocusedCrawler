Shooting suspect Dylann Roof charged with nine counts of murder

<<<<<<< HEAD
(STMW)
 –A Chicago Police detective shot and critically wounded a teenage boy who allegedly pointed a gun at the police during a Friday afternoon foot chase in the Calumet Heights neighborhood.


Area South detectives heard shots fired near East 95th Street and South Jeffrey Boulevard about 3:15 p.m. and called for backup as they followed three fleeing north, according to a Chicago Police statement.


One of the suspects was taken into custody in the 2000 block of East 94th Street and detectives continued to pursue the two other two, police said.


The detectives ordered one of the remaining suspects to drop a gun, but instead the suspect pointed it at detectives, who opened fire, Chicago Police said.


That suspect, a 17-year-old boy, was shot in the leg and taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn in critical condition, authorities said.


No officers were injured and a weapon was recovered at the scene, according to the statement.


The third subject escaped and is not in custody Friday evening.


The Independent Police Review Authority and Area South detectives are investigating.
