The US can't keep track of how many people its police kill. We're counting because lives matter



















To record the deaths of every person killed by police marks a small but important step in restoring their humanity – and holding the powerful accountable

In her 
biography of Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston
, Valerie Boyd explains why it was so difficult to track Hurston’s whereabouts during the novelist’s early twenties. “In 1911 it was relatively easy for someone, particularly a black woman, to evade history’s recording gaze,” wrote Boyd in 
Wrapped in Rainbows: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston
. “If not legally linked to a man, as daughter or wife, black women did not count in some ways – at least to the people who did the official counting.”


The question of 
who counts and whom is counted
 is not simply a matter of numbers. It’s also about power; the less of it you have the less say you have in what makes it to the ledger and what form it takes when it gets there. Collecting information, particularly about people, demands both the authority to gather data and the capacity to keep and transmit it. Those who have both the authority and the capacity need to feel that the people on whom they are keeping tabs on matter. 


The Guardian has, through its new investigative project The Counted, developed the capacity to count the number of people killed by the police. We think it matters; the debate that has ensued on the issue of police killings and 
has been forced on to the national agenda
 through popular protest will be better informed for having easily accessible data.


We think those who have been killed matter; a handful of these deaths make national headlines while the rest barely make a ripple beyond their own families and communities. The data is important. But they are not statistics; they are people. To record their deaths, particularly when the circumstances of those deaths are in dispute, marks a small but important step in the attempt to restore their humanity – albeit posthumously.






The data is important. But they are not statistics; they are people.






There will be those who argue that we are counting the wrong thing; that we should be 
tracking the number of black youths killed by other black youths
, or policemen killed in the line of duty or any number of other tragic categories. To them we say: the internet is a big place. Have at it. Any kind of counting that fills a void, enriches debate and focuses attention on an important issue should be supported.


Contrary to the popular adage, facts don’t always speak for themselves. “The facts speak only when the historian calls on them,” EH Carr argued in his landmark essay, The Historian and His Facts. “It is he who decides to which facts to give the floor, and in what order or context … It is the historian who has decided for his own reasons that Caesar’s crossing of that petty stream, the Rubicon, is a fact of history, whereas the crossing of the Rubicon by millions of other people before or since interests nobody at all.”


We are not calling on these particular facts by accident; we give them the floor for a reason. The idea emerged from the growing public attention paid to police killings over the past year, 
from Ferguson to Baltimore
. Lest there be any doubt, we are counting everybody of every race and both sexes (women make up 5% of police killings so far this year). Significantly more white people are killed by police than black people and, 
as we saw in Baltimore
, black cops can be charged as killers. The race of the police and those they kill is important, but neither fundamentally changes the systemic issue of how those who have a monopoly on violence use their power. Questions about the deadly use of police force are not limited to black people; the answers inform our understanding about the society in which we all live, the laws that govern it and the manner in which those laws are applied.


But the focus there has been on race during this period is no accident either. The most high-profile police killings have been of black men and boys that 
sparked the #BlackLivesMatter movement
. Black men make up about 6.5% of the US population but 29% of the police deaths so far this year; half of those black men shot by police had no gun and one in five had no weapon at all.


As long as there have been black people in America, the issue of how much black lives matter, and why, has always been contested. Under slavery, you could literally count the value of black life in dollars and cents, while black black slaves were constitutionally quantified as three fifths of a person. Abolition got rid of the institution but did little to change the rationale that underpinned it.


“When I was coming up in Mississippi I never knew it was against the law to kill a black man,” Buford Posey, 
an elderly white Mississippian once told me
. It was only when he enlisted to fight in the second world war that he discovered otherwise: “I was 17 years old. When they told me, I thought they were joking.” 


When black deaths don’t matter, there’s little hope for black life. 


Indeed it is, in no small part, precisely because this is not a new problem that it is so vexing. For all the other things that have changed in America that 
basic existential insecurity remains
. 


The circumstances under which each of the police killings that the Guardian has documented have taken place have been quite different, as has the public responses and the political ramifications. Some, like Walter Scott, Eric Garner or Tamir Rice, had their deaths caught on video; others, like Michael Brown and Freddie Gray, did not. Some police officers have been charged in connection with the deaths, while others have 
walked free
. Some deaths have prompted huge demonstrations, a few of which have 
turned violent
; even more have received scant national attention. 


But for all the ways in which each incident has been distinct, their accumulation over several months has been notable for both its sum and its parts: each death is tragic in its own right, while each new one adds to the sense of a broader, deeper, more intractable narrative and growing outrage and frustration. This investigation lends face and form to what has become a banal fact of death in America; the white noise is set sufficiently low to allow the nation to go about its business undisturbed. 


We count to hold the powerful to account, and in the hope that we can shift the patterns of conversation from “isolated incidents” and “bad apples” to a more informed assessment of the widespread patterns and the whole barrel. We count everyone because everyone counts.


•
 This article was amended on 4 June 2015. An earlier version said that under slavery black black slaves were constitutionally quantified as three fifths of a person. The three-fifths rule in the US constitution was not about suffrage, but a way of counting population to determine how many representatives a state would have in the federal government, and for taxation purposes.

CAPTURED: Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof has been caught in Shelby, NC

Posted 11:19 am, June 18, 2015, by Web Staff and CNN Wire 

FacebookTwitterGooglePinterestRedditEmail 





CHARLESTON, S.C. — They got him.
Dylan Storm Roof, the 21-year-old man who police say walked into a South Carolina church and fatally shot nine people attending Bible study class, was arrested in Shelby, N.C., on Thursday, about 250 miles from Charleston.
According to WCCB in Charlotte, investigators say police stopped Roof at Highway 74 and Plato Lee Road, west of Shelby, following a tip from the public. A citizen reported a suspicious vehicle. Roof was armed when he was arrested.  It’s not clear if it’s the same firearm used in the shootings.
“He was cooperative with the officer who stopped him,” officials said during a press conference.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has confirmed the Charleston church shooting suspect has been arrested.

Roof was a quiet person who got a gun for his 21st birthday in April, his uncle told the New York Daily News.
His uncle Carson Cowles, who described his nephew as a shy person who kept to himself, said he was appalled by his nephew’s alleged crimes.
“He’s a monster, and they need to catch him, and he needs to pay for what he’s done,” he said prior to Roof’s capture.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said his niece, Emily, was in an eighth-grade English class with Roof.
“He was quiet, strange, very unsocial and everyone thought he was on drugs,” Graham, a U.S. senator from South Carolina, said of the suspect, relaying the description from his niece Emily and sister Darline Graham Nordone.
The niece did not recall Roof making statements related to race, Graham said.
“I just think he was one of these whacked-out kids. I don’t think it’s anything broader than that,” said Graham, who is running for president. “It’s about a young man who is obviously twisted.”

Previous story:
Police say Roof walked into the church and fatally shot nine people attending Bible study class.
Witnesses told officials Roof reportedly said he was at the church to shoot black people, a source told CNN.
Police released a flier Thursday morning with details of the suspect in the attack on the historic African-American church as they appealed for help to track him down as quickly as possible.
The suspect’s uncle, Carson Cowles, 56, told Reuters that he recognized the man in the surveillance photo distributed by police as his nephew.
“The more I look at him, the more I’m convinced, that’s him,” Carson Cowles, 56, told Reuters in a phone interview. Cowles also said Roof received a .45-caliber pistol as a birthday present in April.
According to Lexington County School District One, Roof attended White Knoll High School in Lexington, S.C., for one year, WCSC is reporting. It’s not clear if he transferred or dropped out.
Roof was currently out on bond in connection with multiple recent arrests on drug and trespassing charges.
“The following subject is wanted for the shooting that occured in Charleston at the Emanuel AME Church. Subject is Dylann Storm Roof w/m 4/3/1994 5’9″ 120 lbs. The subject should be driving a 2000 Hyundai Elantra GS, SC registration LGF330. The vehicle is dark-colored. Subject should be considered armed and dangerous and caution should be used if seen. “
Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen told a news conference that officers “have obtained surveillance videos of the suspect in this case and a suspect vehicle.”
Mullen said the suspect was a “younger white male between 21 and 25 years of age, 5-foot-9 in height” and “has a very distinctive sweatshirt that has markings.”


Surveillance image released by Charleston Police.

Mullen emphasized the suspect is “a very dangerous individual” and said “he should not be approached by anyone.”
Any people who recognize the suspect or spots the vehicle should alert law enforcement, he said, rather than trying to follow themselves.
Woman spared by shooter to give account?
A female survivor told family members that the gunman told her he was letting her live to tell everyone else what happened, Dot Scott, president of the local branch of the NAACP, told CNN.
Scott said she had not spoken to the survivor directly but had heard this account repeated at least a dozen times as she met with relatives of the victims Wednesday night. Scott added that she didn’t know if the survivor had ended up at the hospital or being questioned by police.
Because of the church’s historic significance, it is not unusual for visitors, whether white or black, to visit it, Scott said. She said she’d had no indication that any children were among the victims.
Mullen told the news conference the suspect had been in the church attending a meeting that was going on — and “stayed there almost an hour with the group before the actual event.”
But he declined to comment on whether the suspect had let one woman escape.
