Chicago
 police officers shot and wounded a 14-year-old boy on Thursday night after police say he ignored commands to stop running and drop his weapon.


Local news reports identified the boy as Deguan Curry, although police have yet to release the teenager’s identity. He was in stable condition at Chicago’s Comer Children’s Hospital early Friday morning after being shot in both legs, 
the Chicago Tribune reported
. 


“This is like a really, really bad dream,” Curry’s mother, Ikyshia Webber, told the paper.


Officers responded to a report of shots fired in the 8900 block of South Escanaba Avenue on Thursday, looking for suspects on bicycles, according to a Chicago police statement released on Friday. Police spotted Curry and another person riding bicycles and stopped to talk with them. Officers reportedly noticed a “bulge” protruding from Curry’s pocket.


When officers exited their car, Curry fled on foot and the officers gave chase, police said, and noticed that Curry was carrying a weapon as he ran. Local media 
reported
 that Curry was carrying a gun, but the statement released by police does not specify what weapon he was carrying and the police did not respond to a request for clarification. 


The officers shot the boy in both legs after repeated commands for Curry to stop and drop his weapon were ignored, according to the police statement. Curry was struck three times, the Chicago Tribune later 
reported
. 


Police declined to release additional details about the exchange leading up to the shooting, but said a weapon was found at the scene of the incident. 


Webber 
told
 the Chicago Tribune that she had never seen her son with a gun before.


“I’ve never had a problem with Deguan up until this point other than him being a typical boy,” she said. 


All shootings involving Chicago police are reviewed by the city’s Independent Police Review Authority, which has assumed the investigation into Curry’s shooting. A spokesman for the organization said shooting investigations can take up to one year to complete. The IPRA has investigated nearly 400 police shootings since 2007 and 
found
 just one to be unjustified. The city recently fired an investigator after he ruled several police shootings unjustified and refused to reverse his decision, local media 
reported
.


Chicago police killed 70 people between 2010 and 2014, more than any other major city, according to a recent 
analysis
 from the Chicago-based Better Government Association. When adjusted for population, the BGA’s analysis showed that Chicago ranks fourth for fatal shootings by major police departments in that time period. 


Chicago police have killed three people so far in 2015, according to the Guardian’s ongoing investigation 
The Counted
.

HENRICO COUNTY, Va. — A Virginia gospel musician’s message to Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof is going viral on Facebook.
Years ago musician Marcus Stanley was shot eight times at point-blank range by a gang member, according to WTVR. Stanley said he was left there to die.
He said his own story of survival is a testament to what he knows God can do.
Stanley told WTVR he believes God will bring healing to the families who lost loved ones in the Charleston shooting.
“Words cannot express how painful it is,” Stanley said.  “My heart goes out to the families for the terrible act against their loved ones.”
Stanley said he decided to post a prayer on Roof’s Facebook page in hopes it would reach the suspected killer.
In the post, Stanley encouraged the suspected shooter to try to make amends with God for his actions.
Give your heart to Jesus and confess your sins with a heart of forgiveness. He is the only one that can save your soul and forgive you for the terrible acts you’ve done. I love you Dylan, even in the midst of darkness and pain you’ve caused.
Marcus Stanley’s posts message on Dylan Roof’s Facebook page.
Stanley told WTVR he knew many people wouldn’t understand his message to Roof but decided to post it anyway.
“Instead of attacking, I said let me reach out to him in love. He still has to face the consequences of the law and I’m not denying that, but what I was trying to do was save his soul,” Stanley said.
He said his near-death experience showed him the power of forgiveness.
“I don’t expect the people affected by this tragedy to act like everything’s perfect. It’s a process,” Stanley said.
“There will be tears and there will be laughs and good memories. It’s a healing process. It took me six years to forgive the shooter who shot me.”
He said he hopes the Charleston community will hold to its faith and cling to each other with love.
