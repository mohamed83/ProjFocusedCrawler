BRONX— NYPD officers shot and killed a 19-year-old Bronx man Wednesday morning after he pointed a gun at them.


According to police, he was seen holding a woman at gunpoint in the elevator at 2000 Valentine Avenue before going up to a 4th floor apartment. Sources have identified the suspect at Isiah Hampton.


According to the NYPD Chief of Department James O’Neill, “The officers repeatedly ordered the male to come to the front door of the apartment. The male did not comply.”


Police said Hampton’s ex-girlfriend was also in the apartment. Sources identified her as Shaliyah Ivey. The 19-year-old yelled for help when police arrived.


“The officers then heard the female screaming from the bedroom, ‘Help me! Help me! He is going to kill me,'” O’Neill said.


When NYPD officers opened the bedroom door, Hampton was holding a gun to Ivey’s head. When he allegedly pointed the gun at police she was able to pull away.


According to O’Neill the officers fired multiple rounds at Hampton when he wouldn’t put the gun down.


Cops said the gun was recovered at the scene. Hampton died at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx.


Authorities said Ivey was taken to the hospital due to a graze wound on the shoulder. And she needed stitches for her head. Hampton allegedly pistol-whipped her before police arrived.


According to the NYPD, Hampton has 5 prior arrests and was out on parole for robbery.

The first images of a white suspect who allegedly killed nine people in a black church have been released.
The man, who is thought to be in his early 20s, ‘opened fire’ during a prayer meeting inside the Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston yesterday night.
The assault is being treated as a hate crime.
He managed to flee from police officers attending the chaotic scene but authorities hope to track him down after releasing photographs from a surveillance video.
