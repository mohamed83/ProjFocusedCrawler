CHICAGO (STMW) —
 A male was shot by a Chicago Police sergeant after allegedly fighting with police, resisting arrest and pulling out a cutting instrument Tuesday evening in the South Chicago neighborhood.


South Chicago District officers saw a group of people drinking in public in the 8400 block of South Manistee Avenue at 6:23 p.m., according to a statement from police News Affairs.


When the officers approached them for questioning, the male, whose age was not released, became combative and a “physical altercation” ensued before he ran away, police said. One officer used a stun gun on him without effect, and the male ran into a nearby residence.


An assisting sergeant who arrived at the scene was confronted by the male in the vestibule of the building, police said.


He tried to escape arrest by “retrieving one of several cutting instruments in his possession,” at which point the sergeant shot him once in the right leg, according to the statement.


He was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital with non-life threatening injuries, police said. An officer was also treated at a hospital for minor injuries to his left arm.


Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden could not provide further details on the shooting early Wednesday.


The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting.
