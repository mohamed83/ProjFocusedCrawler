Univ. of Missouri campus police shoot man inside parking garage


 


COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) – Authorities have positively identified a man killed by police inside a University of Missouri parking garage.
Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Kevin Hunter confirmed Thursday that the man killed was Mark Adair. The convicted sex offender was suspected of hiding inside a woman’s car at a supermarket and trying to force her to drive away at gunpoint just hours before he was killed Wednesday night.
His name was released after an autopsy, although the complete medical findings aren’t available.
Columbia police deputy chief Jill Schlude said a campus police officer cornered the man on the second floor of the parking garage and shots were fired after an altercation between the two. More shots were fired after a Columbia police officer arrived.
