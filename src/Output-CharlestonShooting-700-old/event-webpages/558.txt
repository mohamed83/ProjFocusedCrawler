Police Search for Suspect After Man Shot Multiple Times in South Sacramento

SOUTH SACRAMENTO-
Chatting in their car put one couple in harm’s way Wednesday night.
Sacramento County sheriff’s deputies learned of a shooting when a wounded man in his mid-20s drove to Mutual Housing at Sky Park to call for help.
He was attacked just around the corner.
Deputies found bullet casings in front of 7029 Sixth Parkway.
They say the victim and his wife were sitting in a car there when they somehow got into a heated argument with man walking down the street.
That man apparently pulled a gun and fired repeatedly into the car, only striking one occupant.
Neighbors right next door were stunned at what they heard.
“I got up from a nap and all I heard was like six shots.  And I looked outside and all I seen was a lady running this way,” said Dominic McClure.
James Hollis heard the gunfire from several blocks away and said there was no mistaking the sound.
“I thought it was a shooting but I didn’t know where it was. I was kind of surprised it was over here,” he said.
The suspect in this case was last seen on foot and has not yet been arrested.
As of 10:30 p.m. Wednesday, the injured man was in surgery.
Investigators say his wounds are life-threatening, but that he was awake and able to talk to them before being taken to the hospital.
