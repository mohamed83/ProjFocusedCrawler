        COMMENTEMAILMOREMUNCIE -- City police on Tuesday night arrested one of two suspects in the May 6 shooting of a 7-year-old Muncie boy.D'ante Napoleon Davis, 16, was apprehended about 8 p.m. in a car parked in the Chateau Apartments complex, 2401 N. Walnut St., Police Chief Steve Stewart said.The teen's arrest came about 24 hours after investigators had publicly  identified Davis as a suspect in last week's shooting spree near Eighth and Grant streets that critically wounded the child, playing in a nearby yard.The other suspect in the case, 19-year-old Treyvon Bennett, remained at large Tuesday night.Police Sgt. Seth Stanley said Davis did not resist arrest, and immediately asked to consult with an attorney. He remained at City Hall at about 9:30 p.m., but was expected to soon be transferred to the Delaware County jail.Davis was to be preliminarily charged with two counts each of attempted murder and aggravated battery, and a single count of carrying a handgun without a license.The teenager will also be held without bond in the jail on a warrant pending in Delaware Circuit Court 4, where he was charged in January with three counts of armed robbery.In addition to the 7-year-old boy -- who was shot in the right hand and abdomen, and continues to be treated at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis --- a 17-year-old Muncie youth suffered a non-life-threatening bullet wound in last week's shooting spree.Investigators believe while the child was an unintended victim of the street violence, the older victim was a target of the gunmen.In the robbery case filed in January, Davis  is accused of robbing three other teenagers at gunpoint in a near-eastside neighborhood.The teenager was not armed when taken into custody Tuesday, Stanley said.The Muncie Police Department sergeant said investigators had received information that Davis was staying at the northside apartment complex. Police were in contact with the teen's relatives last week and tried without success to arrange Davis' surrender.Contact news reporter Douglas Walker at (765) 213-5851.
