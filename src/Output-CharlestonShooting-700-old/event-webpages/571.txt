STOCKTON —
Stockton Police are searching for a suspect who took officers on a high speed pursuit Saturday afternoon.
Traffic Officers attempted to stop a black Dodge Charger, but the suspect took the police on a four mile pursuit, reaching speeds of 50 mph. The pursuit was terminated by a sergeant, as the suspect headed westbound onto Route 4 at increased speeds.
A citizen reported that the vehicle collided with a parked car on Farmington Road and that a male and female fled from the Charger.
Officers located and impounded the vehicle. Inside of the car were a loaded firearm, credit card manufacturing equipment and patient care reports for the suspect, Keonarine Kham, a 30-year-old male.
If you have any information, contact the Stockton Police Department.
