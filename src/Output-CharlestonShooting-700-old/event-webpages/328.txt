The first images of a white suspect who allegedly killed nine people in a black church have been released.
The man, who is thought to be in his early 20s, ‘opened fire’ during a prayer meeting inside the Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston yesterday night.
The assault is being treated as a hate crime.
He managed to flee from police officers attending the chaotic scene but authorities hope to track him down after releasing photographs from a surveillance video.

‘We want to identify this individual and arrest him before he hurts anyone else.’
