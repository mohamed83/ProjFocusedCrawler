On Wednesday night, a gunman walked into a church in Charleston, killing nine people, including the pastor of the church, in what authorities describe as a "hate crime."
The gunman, identified as 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof, struck at the historic heart of the black community in Charleston.

That fact that the shooting took place in a black church "raises questions about a dark part of our history," President Obama said during an address on the shooting Thursday afternoon.
Known as "Mother Emanuel" to those in the community, Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church has long been tied to African American culture in Charleston. Its congregation is the oldest of its kind in the south and has survived several uprising and violent moments in the city's history.  
"Mother Emanuel Church and its congregation have risen before from flames, from an earthquake, from other dark times to give hope to generations of Charlestonians," Obama said. 
"With our prayers and our love and the buoyancy of hope, it will rise again now as a place of peace," he added.
Speaking during a civil rights event in February, church pastor Sen. Clementa Pinckney touched on role of the church in the community. Pinckney was killed in the attack. 
"Where you are is a very special place in Charleston," he told those gathered in the church. 
The church, said Pinckney, isn't just a place of worship but "a beacon, bearer of the culture and a bearer of what makes us a people." 
“I like to say this is not necessarily unique to us; it’s really what America is all about," said Pinckney.

Mother Emanuel's history
The building itself was built in 1891 but the congregation goes even further back. 
Emanuel's congregation was investigated for involvement in a planned slave revolt in 1822. A prominent church founder, Denmark Vesey, had organized a major slave uprising in Charleston, but authorities were informed of the plot before it could take place. 
The church, rebuilt after it burned to the ground, survived until 1834 when all black churches were outlawed. A PBS profile of Vesey describes why he was an important figure in the fight against slavery. 
Vesey became a martyr for African-Americans and a symbol for the abolitionist movement, while the increasingly militant politics of white America dragged the country toward Civil War.
The ban on black churches didn't stop the members of the community from worshipping, even if they had no formal church to attend. The congregation moved their worship underground, and members gathered for decades in secret, defying the harsh South Carolina laws. The congregation was part of the Underground Railroad, a network that helped slaves escape to freedom.
In 1865, after the end of the Civil War, the congregation was able to worship in public and they named their church "Emanuel." A wooden church, built on the site in 1872, was destroyed by a earthquake in 1886.

In 1909, Booker T. Washington came to the church. Half a century later, Martin Luther King Jr. spoke there about voting rights.

The church pastor Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the shooting, was an active and beloved member of the local community and a civil rights advocacy. He pushed for police officers to wear body cameras and called for accountability after a black resident named Walter Scott was gunned down in April.
Charleston Mayor Joe Riley said the aftermath of the church shooting is  "the most heartbreaking ... I have ever witnessed in my life."
"The only reason someone would walk into a church and shoot people that were praying is out of hate," he said.
