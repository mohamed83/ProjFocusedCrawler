Suspect in Chapel Hill shooting deaths of three college students to face judge


 Craig Stephen Hicks


DURHAM, N.C. — The man accused of fatally shooting three Muslim college students earlier this year will face a judge Monday.
The hearing will determine whether prosecutors will seek the death penalty against 46-year-old Craig Stephen Hicks.
On Feb. 10, 23-year-old Deah Shaddy Barakat, his wife 21-year-old Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, and her sister 19-year-old Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha of Raleigh, were killed at the couple’s home in the 200 block of Summerwalk Circle in the Finley Forest Condominiums in Chapel Hill.
Hicks was charged with three counts of first-degree murder after he drove himself over to Chatham County immediately after the shootings and surrendered to deputies in Pittsboro.
