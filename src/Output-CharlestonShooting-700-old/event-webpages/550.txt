Increased Stockton Police Presence Expected after String of Shootings

STOCKTON-
Stockton police investigators are looking into why nine people were injured in five separate shootings that happened in the span of two hours Monday night. Investigators added the shootings may be gang related.
On Tuesday they ramped up patrol in all five areas to prevent more gun violence.
One woman we spoke with heard the gunshots from the Central Stockton shooting. She believed increasing police presence is just a part of the solution. “Bop, bop, bop just back-to-back of each other,” Tamala Frederickson, a Stockton resident said.
For Frederickson, getting a candy bar at the Cal Park Grocery and Liquor store is an act of bravery.
“Am I safe? Will I be all right? Will I get shot? I was just concerned for my safety and the people that I live with as well,” she said.
The young woman told FOX40 she’s been nervous since hearing the gunshots that injured an adult victim near California and Park at 8:50 Monday night.

Just minutes before, in South Stockton, investigators said two male victims were shot on the 1500 block of Spring Street, an area police have claimed is gang territory.
Around 8:30, gunshots rang in Southwest Stockton on 8th and Lincoln where a suspected gang affiliated Hispanic man shot at a woman.
At 9 p.m. police said three men were shot in the 1000 block of North Wilson. It wasn’t over.
At 10:30 p.m. on West and Morada, investigators said two more people were shot.

All nine victims are expected to survive, according to police.
Stockton’s Black Leadership Council President Ralph Lee White believes more patrol is needed 24/7.
“If you want to stop a lot of the violence, you put your police in the area,” White said.
Stockton Police have been working with a short staff over the years but they’re planning to increase police presence in each of these areas.
“They’re going to target those gangs so that we don’t have any retaliatory shootings,” Officer Joe Silva, a Spokesman with the Stockton Police Department said.
For Frederickson — anything to potentially curb the violence is welcome.
“I don’t want to get shot, at all,” she said. “So I was pretty nervous at first, but I got a sweet tooth right now.”
We asked police about how they’re fighting the stigma against snitching because a lot of these communities people will often stay quiet for fear of retaliation. They pointed out that anyone can leave anonymous tips through their Facebook page or Crimestoppers.
