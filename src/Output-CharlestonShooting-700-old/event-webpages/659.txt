CITRUS HEIGHTS-
The Citrus Heights Police Department is looking for both the victim and the suspect in a possible robbery.
Citrus Heights police found digital evidence of a strong-arm robbery on April 20 showing a victim confronted by a suspect,wearing a gorilla mask, who robbed him of his bicycle.
The evidence suggests there were multiple people present at the time of the robbery.
There have been no reports made with similar circumstances to the Citrus Heights Police Detectives or surrounding agencies.
Police are asking for the community’s help in locating the victim of the bicycle robbery. They are also requesting the public’s help in identifying anyone else who may have been victimized by a suspect wearing a gorilla mask or anyone who has information about the identity of the suspect wearing the gorilla mask.
Detectives believe the masked suspect may be responsible for additional robberies in the Citrus Heights area.
The suspect is described as a white male, about 5-feet-11-inches tall with a medium build.
Anyone with information is strongly encouraged to contact the Citrus Heights Police Department at (916) 727-5500 with information regarding the victim(s) or suspect(s).
