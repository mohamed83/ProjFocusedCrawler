Man killed in police-action shooting remembered by friends, family, IMPD

INDIANAPOLIS,Ind (April 22, 2015)– A man killed in a police-action shooting earlier this month was remembered by friends, family and even a member of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) during a candle light vigil.
Mack Long
Mack Long was shot and killed after a struggle with police near the intersection of East 31st Street and North Sherman Drive. Several religious leaders were present Wednesday evening to honor Long’s life.
“There should not be a mother crying over the loss of her son,” said Bishop Victor T. Wood, New Unity Church.
“Mack, I wish he was here, I really do,” said Keonna Williams.
The support of family helps heal the wounds, but Long’s niece is still struggling with losing the man she looked at as a father.
“It builds us up some but it will never bring him back,” said Laseria Long.
Williams was driving with Long moments before he died. She says Long was in the passenger side of the car when they were pulled over for a routine traffic stop. Moments later, Long allegedly ran from the car with a gun in-hand. Officers eventually caught up with him and a struggle for one of the weapons ensured behind an abandoned house near 31st street and Sherman Avenue. Police say one of the responding officers shot and killed Long in fear for his own life.
“As I shared with the family, it’s alright to be bitter, it’s all right to be angry but there’s going to have to come a point in time when God will have heal that pain and bitterness,” said Bishop Wood.
Long is a convicted felon and had a gun on him the day of the shooting. Family at Wednesday’s vigil still wonder what happened in the grassy area behind the abandoned house.
Police say one of the officers on scene was wearing a body camera during the exchange. Currently, IMPD is reviewing that footage. This case is still under investigation.
