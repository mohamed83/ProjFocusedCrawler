Their call for assistance worked.
After a May 15 robbery at a Mountain American Credit Union the suspect, identified as Brian Powell, turned himself in on May 17.
“Mr. Powell’s family recognized him from the photos displayed by the news media and they convinced him to turn himself in to police,” according to West Jordan police.
On May 17, Powell, 30, came into the West Jordan Police Department with his attorney. Powell allegedly confessed to having robbed the credit union, located at 6761 S. Redwood Road.
“Mr. Powell also returned most of the money taken in the robbery,” police indicated.
On May 15, Brian Powell walked into the credit union and passed a note to a teller demanding money, according to a release from West Jordan police. The note allegedly indicated he had a gun.
The teller complied and Powell left the credit union with an undisclosed amount of money, release stated.
Powell was booked into the Salt Lake County Jail on aggravated robbery, a first-degree felony.
