INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (April 21, 2015) – Police are searching for a suspect after a person was fatally shot on the city’s northeast side Tuesday afternoon.
The shooting occurred in the 4300 block of Evanston Ave around 2:45 p.m. The victim is said to be an older teen.
“We just know that there is another individual laying on the streets that’s dead and gone,” said Bishop Horatio Luster. Luster was on scene with other members of the Ten Point Coalition.
“I heard the shots and looked around the corner of my fence and I saw somebody with a long rifle,” said witness Bill See.
Neighbor Bill See says he saw the alleged gunman and immediately called police.
“When I saw him running this way I just ducked,” said See.
Police are searching for a male suspect who was seen running from the scene with a rifle. On-duty SWAT officers, with the assistance of a K-9 unit, searched the area but were unable to locate anyone.
“They were dressed in black, they had a black hooded sweatshirt, black pants and they were running towards my house,” said See.
A suspect description has not been released.
“Summer hasn’t really kicked in just yet and we are still losing lives like this every single day,” said Luster.
