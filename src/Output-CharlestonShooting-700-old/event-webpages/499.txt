GREENSBORO, N.C. — One of two men accused in the killing of a man Friday in Chesnee, S.C., had a standoff with police, according to the N.C. Department of Justice.
Jason Andrew Cash, 24, of Spartanburg, S.C., and Steven Richard Lewis Jr., 29, of Greensboro.
Steven Richard Lewis Jr., 29, of Greensboro, and Jason Andrew Cash Jr., 24, of Inman, S.C., were arrested Saturday morning in Greensboro.
The suspects are accused in the shooting death of 40-year-old Carey Michael Mauldin.
When police arrived at Lewis’ home at 5714 Old Randleman Road, Cash ran into the woods and Steven Lewis refused to come to the door, according to authorities.
Officials said Cash was apprehended a short distance away, but Lewis remained inside the house for several hours.
Lewis eventually gave up, after pleas for his surrender by police, family and friends, according to the N.C. Department of Justice.
Both men are in the Guilford County jail without bail and had their first court appearances earlier today, according to online jail records.
Cash and Lewis are charged with murder and attempted murder, according to Lt. Kevin Bobo of the Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Office.
The coroner’s office said Carey Mauldin was pronounced dead in his home near Chesnee at about 7:45 a.m. Friday, according to The Greensboro News & Record.
An autopsy showed he died from shots in the abdomen. The office declined to detail how many bullets hit Mauldin. Bobo said Mauldin’s girlfriend was also shot.
Neighbors said the girlfriend’s wrists were bound and she was bleeding badly when she ran to their home for help.
