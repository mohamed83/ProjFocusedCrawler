Nine people are dead after a hate crime shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, on Wednesday night. Pastor Clementa Pinckney, who was also a state senator, was among the victims. 
Pinckney, 41, was a well-known leader in the community and civil rights advocate who recently pushed for police to wear body cameras.

The police have yet to formally confirm the identity of the other victims, but Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said six women and three men were killed at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church.
"The only reason someone would walk into a church and shoot people that were praying is out of hate," said Charleston Mayor Joe Riley, who described the scene as "the most heartbreaking ... I have ever witnessed in my life."
Who was Clementa Pinckney?
Pinckney was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1996 at the age of 23. Four years later, he was elected to the South Carolina Senate, becoming the youngest African-American in the state to be elected to the State Legislature. 
In February, Pinckney spoke to a group gathered in the historic church for a civil rights event. 
"[Our church] stands for the universal vision of all people being treated fairly under the law as God sees us,” Pinckney said.
The church, built in 1891, isn't just a place of worship but "a beacon, bearer of the culture and a bearer of what makes us a people," he said. 
“But I like to say this is not necessarily unique to us; it’s really what America is all about," Pinckney added.

Pinckney's colleague, South Carolina Senator Tom Davis shared a Facebook post in his honor. It shows a video of Pinckney speaking in the state senate in the aftermath of the Walter Scott shooting, advocating for police accountability. Pinckney campaigned for legislation to require police officers to wear body cameras.
"As we mourn his death, also remember his passion and sense of justice, both of which were on display in this Senate speech in the aftermath of Walter Scott's murder," wrote Davis.
