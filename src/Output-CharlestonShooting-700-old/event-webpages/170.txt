Dozens gather at Bethel A.M.E. in Greensboro to remember victims of Charleston shooting

GREENSBORO, N.C. — Dozens of people filled Bethel A.M.E. Church including people with close ties to the historic Charleston church, for a community vigil to remember the victims of the shooting.   
“We would walk to the church,” said Mozell Weston who grew up in Emanuel A.M.E and returned last summer for a family reunion.  “Going back home it reminds me of my foundation, where I sang in the choir, seeing my Sunday school teacher.”
Weston knows the family of the victims and said the pain of Wednesday night is being comforted by the community. 
 “Joy to know that you are not in this by yourself,” she said.  “It’s going to be a period time of healing for all of us and this is just the beginning of the journey.”
Weston said she is searching for understanding; not just for the families who lost loved ones but also for the alleged shooter Dylann Roof, that maybe some sense will be made of the events so it won’t happen again.
