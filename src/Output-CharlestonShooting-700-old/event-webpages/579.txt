SACRAMENTO-
A standoff between a man and Sacramento Police officers ended just after 10:30 Wednesday night after SWAT teams fired gas canisters into a home  in South Sacramento.
Police had created a perimeter around the home at 63rd Avenue and 21st Street where a man had barricaded himself inside.
Officers initially responded after reports of domestic violence.
At least one gunshot was believed to be heard from inside the home when officers arrived, police said.
Police were trying to communicate with the suspect throughout the evening with a loud speaker, and they had seen the man come to the door and turn lights on and off.
After tear gas was fired into the home, the suspect came out. He will be taken to a hospital to be evaluated before being booked into jail.
No one else was inside the home at the time.
