Are you going to suggest that Salvador Miranda Flores was on his way to Bible school with a box of baby kittens when he was accosted by some big bad police officer who was just desperate to find somebody he could shoot?

The puke was restricted from owning or possessing firearms.  The female had  outstanding warrants.  Now when Amal Hourieh gets out of jail she’s going to have to go out and round herself up a new boyfriend.

I’m sure he’s in the country legally.  Illegals never commit crimes.  They are a fine addition to our multi-cultural family, and nothing but a positive for your society and our economy.
