Police investigate reported attempted abduction on south side of Indianapolis

INDIANAPOLIS (May 14, 2015) – Indianapolis Metropolitan police are investigating an attempted abduction on the south side of Indianapolis.
According to IMPD, a 12-year-old boy left home around 8 a.m. Thursday and walked to his bus stop in the area of Yoke Street and Stanley Avenue. He saw a green Jeep with a red 2-inch pinstripe around the vehicle. He also said the Jeep had rusty wheels.
The vehicle circled the black a few times. The boy said a man in his late 20s to early 30s gave him “weird looks” as he passed by. The boy described him as a white male, clean shaven, with short honey-brown hair.
Once the boy arrived at the bus stop, the man offered him a candy bar. After declining the offer, the boy said the man reached out from his driver’s side window and grabbed him around the wrist. The boy broke free, ran to a friend’s house and called police.
On Thursday afternoon, an IPS police vehicle sat outside the bus stop. School officials say they have added extra police presence in the area after the attempted abduction. They say student safety is a top priority.
Neighbors say this is a quiet community full of kids. They’re concerned the man may have been targeting the boy.
“It’s very scary. I want it to get resolved. Nothing happens like this around here. It’s very scary, especially when you know kids that are on that bus stop,” said neighbor Sara Kidwell.
The bus stop location has also been a concern for neighbors. It’s near an alley and directly across from railroad tracks where neighbors say is a hang-out spot for drug users. Parents say they will use this situation as a lesson for their kids about stranger danger.
“Don’t get near the car. Don’t give them a chance to get close. Just get home and tell mom,” neighbor, Paula Shoultz said.
