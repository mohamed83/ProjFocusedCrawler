Police seek vehicle, 2 suspects after car stolen at gunpoint in Holladay


 


HOLLADAY, Utah – Police are seeking two suspects and a stolen vehicle after a woman was carjacked by a man with a gun late Thursday night outside of a bowling alley in Holladay.
The woman left Olympus Hills Bowling Lanes, 4015 Wasatch Boulevard, just after 10 p.m. Thursday and she walked past a man and woman before sitting down in her car. Once seated, the man approached and put a gun in her face and demanded the car keys.
The victim suffered a cut on her lip as a result. Lt. Justin Hoyal of the Unified Police Department said things could have been worse but the woman did what they encourage citizens to do in such situations.
“The victim did everything right, complied with the suspects and wasn’t hurt any worse than just the cut on the lip,” Hoyal said.
The suspects were last observed traveling west toward Wasatch Boulevard. The vehicle is a gray Subaru Tribeca with Utah license plate C50 6HH. The suspects are a white male with facial hair who was dressed all in black and a Latina woman who was described as being short.
Anyone with information about the alleged crime or who sees the vehicle is asked to contact police. UPD can be reached by calling 801-743-7000.

The right thing is to comply with criminals?  No.  The right thing is to shoot them in the face.
