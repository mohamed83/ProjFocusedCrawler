Orem police arrest 2 of 4 people suspected of installing scanners on ATMs to defraud users


 


OREM, Utah – Police in Orem have arrested two of four suspects who allegedly installed scanning devices on ATMs in order to fraudulently obtain card information from those who used the machines.
The suspects were featured on FOX 13 News Tuesday as part of Orem Police Department’s “Tattle tale Tuesday”, and Wednesday police announced the arrests.
Lt. Craig Martinez, Orem Police Department, said the Sandy branch of the Orem bank first targeted by the alleged scam artists found an active “skimmer” on their outside ATM.
Orem police and FBI cyber crime task force personnel staked out the bank, and when the suspects returned to remove the skimmer the police followed them. The two suspects, identified as 23-year-old Ionella Stefan and 25-year-old Alexandru Stefan, were stopped and arrested near Nephi.
Martinez said both suspects are California residents but were both born in Romania, and he said it is believed the pair may be involved with organized crime elements out of Eastern Europe.
