BOUNTIFUL, Utah — Bountiful police are searching for a man who robbed 12 people at an assisted living center last week.
Police said the alleged crimes happened July 1 at the Legacy House of Bountiful, which is located at 79 East Center Street.
The suspect was captured on surveillance video, see the video above for those images.
Police said the man walked into the Legacy House and started taking things that were easily accessible from patient rooms, like jewelry and credit cards.
Staff members eventually noticed the man and confronted him, but he ran from the facility.
Anyone who recognizes the man or who has any information about his whereabouts is asked to call Bountiful Police at 801-298-6000.
