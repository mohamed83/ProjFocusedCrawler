        TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREIn Greenville-area churches, plainclothes police officers sit in pews on Sundays. Uniformed private security officers also can be seen walking church halls during the week.But in the wake of the church shootings Wednesday night in Charleston, local pastors reiterated their concerns about having safe ministries and said they hope existing security measures are adequate.At First Presbyterian Church in Greenville, for example, officials have been intentional about congregational safety after shooting incidents in churches in other states several years ago, according to Senior Pastor Richard Gibbons."We have several layers of security in place throughout the week including an undercover police presence and armed security officers," he said. "The safety of our worshipers especially our youth and children is paramount at First Pres and we take it very seriously."Safety experts say few churches have a ministry dedicated to security and emergency planning, and they urge church leaders to address key risks they face."Houses of worship, especially Christian churches, are the victims of crimes and tragic situations each year, and most people, even in our (security) industry, are not aware of the extent," Jeffrey A. Hawkins, a public safety and security professional, wrote on a blog sponsored by American Military University.An average of 100 Christian churches are victims of arson every year, with some burned to the ground, Hawkins said.A poll once showed more than 75 percent of all churches in the U.S. had no security measures in place, he said.The National Black Church Initiative, a faith-based coalition of 34,000 churches comprised of 15 denominations and 15.7 million African Americans, is decrying the nine murders of church-goers in Charleston as hatred "and a violent affront on Christ's Church."The group said NBCI president the Rev. Anthony Evans was traveling to South Carolina to direct 682 churches on security measures for congregants and families."The dangerous unknowns of the murders, their intent and their allies still remain, and allies must rally together against those who are intent on silencing the black church and its members," the group said in a statement.Many large local churches pay off-duty police officers and sheriff's deputies to establish a security presence on Sundays. Many smaller churches, however, don't. And it is rarer that Wednesday night services, such as the one in Charleston, will have as much, if any, protection since attendance is less and doing so drives up a church's cost.Sgt. Jennings Autrey of the Greenville County Sheriff's Office, is among those who work at local churches on Sundays.He works at a church on Woodruff Road, primarily conducting traffic control before and after services. While services are being held, he patrols the parking lot looking for any suspicious activity.THE GREENVILLE NEWS'Horrific:' Suspect in Charleston killings in custodyCharleston, S.C., shooting suspect Dylann Storm Roof, center, is escorted from the Shelby Police Department in Shelby, N.C., Thursday, June 18, 2015.

You may also like these photo galleries:ReplayAutoplayShow ThumbnailsShow CaptionsLast SlideNext SlideAt another church, five officers maintain security, including one who sits with the congregation during the service and another who stays near the nursery area, Autrey said. Two walk along the vestibule and atrium areas, "watching and making sure" that nobody who looks suspicious comes in, he said.Since there aren't metal detectors, he watches a person's actions closely. Also, patrol cars are parked in front of churches as a deterrent.When deputies work a side job, they are employed by the churches and most are in uniform, which includes a gun belt "so there's no question in anybody's mind these are deputies with the Sheriff's Office," Autrey said."We don't enforce administrative policies of these places," Autrey said. "We are there for a security function.""It's been very successful so far," he said.Some churches also employ private security guards who walk church halls on Sundays and throughout the week.One such firm, American Security in Greenville, provides churches with armed guards.Randy Harrison, the company's president and a former agent with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), said a large part of the challenge is that churches have an open-door policy."Typically in a business or a school or factory, you would turn away people who maybe look different than you," Harrison said.But a church is there "to minister to people," he said. "Many churches go out and recruit, invite people from the community in.""We're just there primarily to look for anything or anybody that really acts odd or anybody that causes a disturbance," he said.As churches and congregations across the state struggled with the shootings in Charleston, they turned to faith and prayer in an attempt to understand."Our immediate thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who have died in this dreadful tragedy," said Gibbons of First Presbyterian. "We pray that in the midst of this senseless violence the comforting presence of Christ will be a living reality for the families as they begin to adjust to the mind-numbing grief of their terrible loss."He also said, "Over the last few years our nation has been horrified at the violence exhibited by gunmen in theaters, schools, colleges and churches, and our congregation is immensely grateful for the courage and service provided by our local police officers."
