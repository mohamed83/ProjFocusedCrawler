He later waived extradition and was headed back to South Carolina.According to reports, the gunman pulled a semi-automatic handgun and began firing on the prayer group, pausing once to reload. "There is absolutely no doubt in my mind this was a hate crime," Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen said at a midday press conference.Mullen called the shooting "a horrific situation — one that has touched the heart and soul of everyone in this community."Among the dead was state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, 41, head pastor at Emanuel AME. He was elected to the S.C. House of Representatives at the age of 23 and won election to the state Senate at 27, the church's website said. His district included Jasper, Beaufort, Charleston, Colleton and Hampton counties."We woke up today, and the heart and soul of South Carolina was broken," Gov. Nikki Haley said.FACEBOOKFacebookRemembering the victimsCharleston County Coroner Rae Wooten identified the other victims as:Myra Thompson, 59, a church member and sister of Delta Sigma Theta sorority.

Her son, Chris Singleton, is a baseball player at Charleston Southern University.And the Rev. Dr. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74, a member of the ministerial staff at Emanuel AME. He was the only shooting victim who didn't die at the church but at MUSC, while in the operating room, the coroner said.A tense nation turns to mourningThe shootings sparked statements of revulsion at the killings and sympathy from groups and elected officials nationwide, spurred President Barack Obama to urge a national conversation about gun violence, and caused several presidential candidates to cancel plans to campaign in the state.U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the Justice Department has begun a hate crime investigation.In Washington, Obama said the fact that the shootings happened at a black church raise questions about a "dark part of our history.""This is not the first time black churches have been attacked," he said. "And we know hatred across races and faiths pose a particular threat to our Democracy and our ideals. The good news is that the outpouring of unity and strength and fellowship and love across Charleston today from all races, from all faiths, from all places of worship indicates that those old vestiges of hatred can be overcome."THE GREENVILLE NEWSCapitol Hill grieves for CharlestonTHE GREENVILLE NEWSSenate praises fallen comrade: "He was the best of us"Quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King's comments following the deaths of four girls in a bombing in a black Alabama church during the civil rights struggle, the president said that people should look beyond despair to the "buoyancy of hope.""The Rev. Pinckney and his congregation understood that spirit," Obama said.Charleston Mayor Joe Riley called the suspect a "horrible scoundrel" and said the community needed to focus helping the victims, the church and their families."You will see an outpouring of love and assistance," he said.Meanwhile, the national president of the NAACP called the shootings "obscene" and the act of a coward."There is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people engaged in the study of scripture," said Cornell William Brooks, president and CEO of the civil rights organization. "Today, I mourn as an AME minister, as a student and teacher of scripture, as well as a member of the NAACP."Worshippers gather to pray down the street from the Emanuel AME Church following a shooting Wednesday, June 17, 2015, in Charleston, S.C.

A ninth died later at a hospital. Authorities said three others survived.The FBI was called in to assist in the investigation, as well as the State Law Enforcement Division and other law enforcement agencies.Police initially released a photo of the vehicle captured on surveillance cameras. Roof's childhood friend, Joey Meek, alerted the FBI after recognizing him in a surveillance camera image, said Meek's mother, Kimberly Konzny. Roof had worn the same sweatshirt while playing Xbox videogames in their home recently.A Confederate flag was on his license plate, Konzny said, and a photo on his Facebook page shows him wearing a jacket with stitched-on flag patches from Rhodesia, which is now black-led Zimbabwe, and apartheid-era South Africa.Roof wasn't known to the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., and it's not clear whether he had any connection to the 16 white supremacist organizations operating in South Carolina, but he appears to be a "disaffected white supremacist," based on his Facebook page, said the center's president, Richard Cohen.THE GREENVILLE NEWSMore Upstate churches increasing security measuresThe shooting evoked painful memories of other attacks. Black churches were bombed in the 1960s when they served as organizing hubs for the Civil Rights movement and burned by arsons across the South in the 1990s. Others survived shooting sprees.This particular congregation, which formed in 1816, has its own grim history: A founder, Denmark Vesey, was hanged after trying to organize a slave revolt in 1822, and white landowners burned the church in revenge, leaving parishioners to worship underground until after the Civil War.Wednesday's shooting came two months after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man, Walter Scott, by a white police officer in neighboring North Charleston, which increased racial tensions. The officer awaits trial for murder, and the shooting prompted South Carolina to pass a law, co-sponsored by Pinckney, to equip police statewide with body cameras.Saying today he has had to make statements about mass shootings "too many times," Obama said the nation needs to address gun violence."We don't have all the facts," the president said. "But we do know that once again innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun," he said.FACEBOOKFacebook"Now is the time for mourning and healing. But let's be clear, at some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."Obama said it does not happen in other places "with this frequency" and "it is in our power to do something about it."The president said he recognizes the "politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues" for change."But it would be wrong for us not to acknowledge it and at some point it's going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it and for us to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively."It was the 14th time the president has spoken on a gun-related tragedy during his tenure.The Associated Press contributed to this report.A group of local pastors and church goers pray together for the victims of Wednesday's shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., on Thursday, June 18, 2015 at Anderson Mill Road Baptist Church in Spartanburg.
