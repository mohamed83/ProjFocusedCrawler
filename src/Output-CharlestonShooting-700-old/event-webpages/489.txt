Police search for suspects accused of slashing man with knife, stealing wallet


 


SOUTH SALT LAKE, Utah – Police are asking for the public’s help finding two men accused of slashing a victim with a knife and then stealing his wallet.
Officers said, just before midnight, a man was taking out the trash at a business near 900 W. and 2500 S. when two men approached him and demanded his wallet.
The three men got into a fight and police said one of the suspects pulled out a knife and slashed the man in his stomach.
He is expected to recover.
Officers said the suspects got away with the man’s wallet and a few items from an unlocked car.
“We encourage people to be cautious especially when working late at night,” South Salt Lake Police Sgt. Matthew Oehler said. “It’s good too, if you have a co-worker available to go with you outside; if you’re going to be working late that’s certainly beneficial.”
Police don’t have a description of the suspects at this time.
Officers said they would like to speak with anyone who might have information at (801) 840-4000.
