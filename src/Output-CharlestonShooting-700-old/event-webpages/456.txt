Two more suspects arrested in shooting of beloved Utah store clerk

MURRAY, Utah – Murray police now have a total of three suspects in custody, including the person they believe to be the trigger man in the murder of a beloved convenience store clerk weeks ago.
Martin A. Castillo
It was very early on the morning of March 18 when two armed suspects stormed into the Lee Market and robbed the clerk, Dave Marsh, at gunpoint.
As they were running away, Marsh threw a register tray at one of the suspects, who then opened fire, hitting Marsh with at least one bullet.
Marsh died a few days later at the hospital.
Since then, authorities have been involved in an intense manhunt for the suspects.
Thanks to the evidence and several viewer tips, police made the first arrest, 20-year-old Alexis Alan Garcia, last week.
Over this past weekend, tips led them all the way to Florida where they arrested 19-year-old Martin Castillo.
Juan A. Zalazar
On Wednesday afternoon, police busted 23-year-old Juan Zalazar as he was going into a relative’s home.
Officers said they believe he is the shooter in this case.
Martin Castillo is in the process of being extradited back to Utah from Florida.
Police won’t say exactly what he was doing there but they do not believe he fled there to hide.
They said they also do not believe Castillo was in the Murray store that March morning and said they feel confident the two individuals were Zalazar and Garcia.
Much of this will likely be sorted out in the coming days when formal charges are filed in the third District Court.

After their trial and conviction these three killers belong on death row.  And yes, if you’re involved in a robbery where someone is shot and killed the law considers you to be responsible.

You really think they’ll give the death penalty to a guy who wasn’t even in the store at the time?

JEWLZZZ

No Bob, in the real world none of these animals will get the death penalty.  That doesn’t change the legal fact that “If more than one person participates in a felony that involves murder all involved are equally responsible, even those who didn’t cause the death. In some cases, even those who weren’t present when the death occurred are responsible.
Feel free to look it up for yourself.

Racist.

C'MON BOB

Citizenship involves nationality and has nothing to do with race Bob.  Get your dad to explain it to you, and if you don’t have one of those then ask your mommy.

Hey fox 13. Any chance you could look into the increased Norteno Gang activity in Murray?

Yeah, journalists handle crime, not the police.

Mike. I have asked Murray ps to do something about the gang problem months before David was murdered. I am asking the media because the police don’t seem to care

…and yes this is the democrat party’s fault. They are the ones who transport these people up here to attack us Americans.
