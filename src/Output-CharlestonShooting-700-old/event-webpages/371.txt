GREENWOOD, Ind. (July 9, 2015) – A man was taken to an Indianapolis hospital after a shooting involving police on the south side Thursday morning.
Officers responded to the 400 block of Prince Drive in White River Township in Greenwood around 9:48 a.m. after a female caller reported a man she had broken up with was sending her threat messages, threatening to harm himself. It was also reported the man had access to numerous weapons.
When authorities arrived on the scene, they located the man, 31-year-old Daryll Hedges, sitting in a 2007 GMC pick-up truck parked in the lot. Deputies ordered the man to exit the vehicle, but authorities said he did not comply with commands. He then made an “aggressive move,” according to investigators.
Two Johnson County deputies shot the man, who was taken to IU Health Methodist Hospital in critical condition.
Authorities are investigating the shooting.
