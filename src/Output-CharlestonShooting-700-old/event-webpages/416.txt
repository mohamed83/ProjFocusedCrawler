West Valley City assault, robbery suspect escapes police chase


 


WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah – Police are looking for a man they say led them on a high-speed chase overnight.
Officers said David Saul Hernandez has active warrants for aggravated assault and robbery.
The chase started when officers spotted his vehicle near 4500 S. and 150 W. Wednesday night.
They stopped following him less than 20 minutes later near 3900 S. and 900 E. in Salt Lake City to avoid the public safety risk.
Hernandez was driving a 2010 blue Ford Focus and is considered armed and dangerous.
West Valley City Police said they would like to speak with anyone who might have information.
