(Charles Ommanney/The Washington Post)  Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has canceled campaign events scheduled for Thursday in Charleston, S.C., due to a deadly church shooting there. Aides said after midnight that the former Florida governor would postpone events scheduled for Thursday morning "due to the tragic events unfolding in South Carolina tonight." "Governor Bush’s thoughts and prayers are with the individuals and families affected by this tragedy," a spokeswoman said. Bush was scheduled to detail some of his ideas about revamping the U.S. military and American foreign policy during a veterans town hall meeting at the Charleston Maritime Center. He has already been to New Hampshire and Iowa this week after formally launching his campaign Monday in his hometown of Miami. He is scheduled to speak Friday at a Christian conservative conference in Washington and attend the first fundraiser of his campaign there before speaking Friday night in Tampa.     A prayer circle formed following a shooting that left 9 dead at an historic African American church in Charleston, S.C.
