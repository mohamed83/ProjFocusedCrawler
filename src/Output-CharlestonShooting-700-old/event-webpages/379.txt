Police shoot suspect on city’s near east side


 


INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (June 14, 2015) – Police shot a man after he broke into a duplex and shot a woman early Sunday morning.
Investigators say around 12:50 a.m. the ex-boyfriend of the victim broke into the house and shot her in the face. Police identified the man Monday as Ivan Deida, 37, Indianapolis.
Police say they were responding to a burglary in progress at 425 N. Hamilton Ave. when they heard gunshots and screaming inside the home.

Arriving officers say they saw a man pointing a weapon at the screaming victim. Unsure if the suspect would further hurt the victim, an IMPD officer shot the suspect.
The female victim was transported to Eskenazi Hospital. Deida went to IU Health Methodist Hospital.
Officers say they were able to escort the victim’s sister and several children, who were present in the home, to safety.
