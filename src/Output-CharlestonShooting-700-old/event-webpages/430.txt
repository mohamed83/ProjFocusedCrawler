Police investigating two shootings that leave one man dead on city’s westside


 


INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (May 26, 2015) – Shortly after 10:30 p.m. Monday, officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department were dispatched to the 800 block of Chapelwood Boulevard on the report of several shots  being fired.  The run was subsequently updated to reflect someone had been shot.
When officers arrived, they found an unidentified and unresponsive male suffering from a gunshot wound to the head.  EMS crews arrived and pronounced the victim deceased.  Moments later officers received a second dispatched run reference a person shot to the 500 block of Venus Drive.  When officers arrived there, they found an adult male suffering from a gunshot wound to the stomach.  The unidentified man was transported to Eskenazi Hospital in stable condition.
Investigators preliminary believe that the two shooting incidents are related and likely the result of an ongoing disturbance.  The Indianapolis-Marion County Forensic Services Agency is processing the crime scene, and the Marion County Coroner’s Office will positively identify the victim.  Homicide detectives continue to canvass the area for additional information but urge anyone with information about the shooting to call Crime Stoppers of Indiana at (317) 262-TIPS.
