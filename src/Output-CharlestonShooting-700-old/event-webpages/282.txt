Police respond to shooting on far east side


 


INDIANAPOLIS (June 16, 2015) – A shooting was reported on the far east side Tuesday morning.
It happened near a Citgo gas station in the area of 30th Street and Mitthoeffer Road. An Indianapolis Metropolitan police officer on the scene said a fight broke out and escalated into a shooting. Investigators didn’t locate a shooting victim, but they did find shell casings at the scene. They have description of a shooting suspect but no one is in custody.
The location is about a mile-and-a-half away from a homicide early Monday morning that killed a 19-year-old man.
