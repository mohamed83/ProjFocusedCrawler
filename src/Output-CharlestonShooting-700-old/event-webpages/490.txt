SALT LAKE CITY — Police are seeking the public’s help in finding a man who robbed a Salt Lake City bank Friday afternoon.
At about 3 p.m., the man entered a Wells Fargo, 1710 S. Redwood Road, brandished a weapon and demanded money, according to Salt Lake City police. The teller complied and the suspect fled south along the west side of Redwood Road. He was on foot.
Detectives identified additional video of the suspect at another bank minutes before he robbed the Wells Fargo Bank, police say. Police believe the video shows a failed attempt to rob the bank.
The video shows the suspect walk into a Bank of Utah, 2309 S. Redwood Road. The suspect walks up to the counter then goes and sits down in a waiting area in the middle of the bank.
Anyone who recognizes the man in the video or has information related to this case is asked to call Salt Lake City police at 801-799-3000.
