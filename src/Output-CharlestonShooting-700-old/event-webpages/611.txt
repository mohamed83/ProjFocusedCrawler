MUNCIE, Ind. (May 12, 2015)– Police identified and later arrested a second suspect Tuesday in connection with a May 6 shooting that injured a 7-year-old boy.
The arrested suspect, 16, is friends with the other suspect, 19-year-old Treyvon Bennett. Police say they were together before and during the shooting. The family of the 16-year-old suspect told police they would turn him in on Friday. The family told police this week that they have not seen him.
He was taken into custody around 8 p.m. Tuesday, according to our news-gathering partners at the Muncie Star Press.
Bennett is still on the run.
The young boy suffered injuries to his right hand and abdomen in the shooting and a 17-year-old male was hit in the left hip. Two houses on 8th Street were also struck by bullets.
The 16-year-old suspect had a warrant out for his arrest for violating probation from a previous armed robbery. That warrant was filed the day after the Muncie shooting. Police say he will be charged as an adult for this shooting.
Bennett should be considered armed and dangerous.
