Police search for suspect after Indy 500 pace car stolen from dealership


 


ZIONSVILLE, Ind. (April 9, 2015) – An Indianapolis 500 pace car was stolen from a Chevrolet dealer on the city’s northwest side late Wednesday night.
Police say the suspect stole the car from inside of Bill Estes Chevrolet on 96th Street just before midnight. He then drove the car through the glass front door and down a flight of stairs.
The car was abandoned at Fort Road and Irishman Run Lane in Zionsville after police say the car was no longer drivable.
The suspect is described as a white male with glasses and no shirt. Police believe he is on foot, and say he may be hurt from driving the car through the glass door with the top down.
Police from Zionsville, Boone County, Whitestown and Indianapolis were searching the area.
Officers ask anyone who sees suspicious activity in the area surrounding Fox Hollow to call 911.
