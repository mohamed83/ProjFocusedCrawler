GOLDSBORO, N.C. — Kenneth Morgan Stancil III tried to wrestle with court officers as they rushed him out of a Goldsboro courtroom Thursday.
Stancil yelled and cursed at Superior Court Judge Arnold O. Jones and was thrown out of the courtroom.
The 20-year-old is charged with first-degree murder for the shooting death of 44-year-old Ron Lane at Wayne Community College Monday morning.
Lane was Stancil’s former boss at a campus print shop.
According to a jail transcript, Stancil says he shot lane — who was openly gay — for flirting with his younger brother on Facebook.
Stancil’s mother says that’s not true and believes her son was angry for losing his job.
