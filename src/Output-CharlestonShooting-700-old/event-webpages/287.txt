Police justified in White County shooting


 


MONON, Ind. (May 2, 2015) – On April 10, 2015 a hostage situation started in Watseka, IL and ended in Monon, IN with a hostage being freed and a suspect being shot after allegedly pointing his firearm at police.
Indiana State Police say the suspect robbed a business at gunpoint in Watseka and fled the scene by foot.  He was then confronted by police at an auto dealership where he took a female hostage and fled in her Napa delivery truck.  Police lost the vehicle after crossing the border into Indiana.
A few hours later an armed robbery occurred in Lafayette at the Lafayette City Cash America that allegedly involved the Napa truck.  The suspect’s vehicle lead police on a chase into White County were stop sticks were deployed.  The vehicle ran over the stop sticks and the pursuit was slowed until the truck pulled into a parking lot on the north edge of Brookston, IN where the suspect dumped the damaged truck and moved himself and his hostage into an SUV.
The SUV drove north through Reynolds on U.S. 421 to Monon, IN. The police deployed stop sticks. While attempting to avoid them the SUV hit another car.  Damage from the crash caused the SUV to begin breaking down.  On the north side of Monon, the SUV ran a silver Chrysler van off the roadway.  The driver and the two passengers exited the van and the suspect moved his hostage at gunpoint into the van.
Police were able to box the van in and when the suspect pointed his weapon at the officers, they defended themselves and fatally shot the suspect.  The hostage was able to exit the van and escape with the help of other officers on scene. The hostage suffered minor injuries and was treated and released from IU Health White Memorial Hospital in Monticello, IN.
