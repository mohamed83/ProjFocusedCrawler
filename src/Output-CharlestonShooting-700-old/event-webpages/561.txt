STOCKTON-
UPDATE: 5:30 p.m. Andeola has been captured by Tracy Police, according to the Stockton Police Department. He will be booked into San Joaquin County Jail.

The Stockton Police Department said they have identified the man they believe stole a silver Honda Civic with a little boy inside on Mother’s Day.
John Manual Andeola, 47, is wanted for kidnapping, child endangerment and stealing a vehicle. Investigators released the information Friday morning, less than a week after the alleged carjacking took place.

“So right now, we’re asking for the community’s help. If they see the suspect they need to call 911 immediately,” Officer Joe Silva, a Spokesman with the Stockton Police Department said.
The boy’s mother told FOX40 off-camera, “My kids are traumatized,” and says since Sunday they’ve been by her side because they’re afraid.
She explained that on Sunday afternoon she was getting ready to drive away when a man jumped in the driver’s seat instead. She and her family were screaming for help as police claimed, Andeola sped off with the 4-year-old in the back seat near East Lindsay and E Streets. The mother added, her neighbor spotted the man trying to break into his car. He scared him off and he hid behind a nearby fence.
Before the man could get away the brave boy jumped out before the Honda Civic could turn the corner. The mother said the boy explained it to her this way, “‘Because Mommy, I don’t know the people. If I don’t jump out I’m lost.” She added, “I would never leave my kids in the car. That’s common sense.”
Three days later, Stockton officers get their big break when they find the stolen Civic on Sierra Nevada and Fremont Streets. 35-year-old Tony Ramirez was arrested for stolen vehicle and possession of stolen property charges but it wasn’t over.
“Investigators still don’t know exactly who the original kidnapper gave the vehicle to but the big break during the middle of the week was locating that vehicle,” Officer Silva explained.
On Friday, police identify who they believe kidnapped the 4-year-old, “He’s also on probation for auto theft,” Silva explained.
Andeola, a man who has been in trouble before for alleged stolen auto theft charges, now facing kidnapping, child endangerment and stealing a vehicle charges.
The Stockton mom did not say much about the latest break in the case. She’s just hoping to keep her kids safe.
If you have seen Andeola, please contact the Stockton Police Department or Crimestoppers: (209) 946-0600. They are offering rewards of up to $10,000.
