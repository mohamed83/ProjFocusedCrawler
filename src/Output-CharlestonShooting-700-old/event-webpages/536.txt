        TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORESHELBY, N.C. -- A tip from a local florist led Shelby Police to the suspect in the mass shooting at a Charleston church.Police and the FBI identified him in the killing of 9 people at a historic black church in downtown Charleston as Dylann Storm Roof, a 21-year-old from the Columbia area. They released his picture and a description of the car he was driving as part of the manhunt early Thursday morning.Debbie Dills watched the news coverage from her home in south Gastonia. As she got into her car to drive to work in Shelby at Frady's Florist, the mass killing was heavy on her mind."I was very burdened for the people in Charleston," Dills told NBC Charlotte by phone.WCNCMass shooting suspect back in Charleston after Shelby arrestShe noticed a car matching the description from the news on Highway 74 near Sparrow Springs Road in Gastonia.  She called her friend Todd Frady to see what he thought she should do.  She said by looking at her phone, her first call to Frady was at 10:21 a.m.Roof's car pulled over in Shelby (Photo: WCNC)"I paid close attention to the pictures on TV, but I thought no. It can't be him," Dills said.Frady called the Kings Mountain Police Department."I noticed the car. And I noticed the boy's haircut," Dills said.But then she said she thought what if it wasn't him."I was scared," Dills said by phone as she started to cry. "I felt bad. I felt really weird. I felt like it was him, but I didn't want it to be him."Then, she caught up to him again."I pulled up behind him.  There were other cars around him," she said.Dills said Roof was by himself in the car and wasn't driving erratically.  By then, she was along Highway 74 in Shelby."I thought please don't let him think I'm following him," Dills said.She told Frady exactly where they were. Frady told Kings Mountain Police who told Shelby Police. She stayed behind the black Hyundai until she saw a Shelby Police car.  The officer pulled Roof over."I was just thankful," Dills said.  "Those families needed that part.  He did a horrible, horrible thing."Dills went on to say, "This isn't about Debbie and Todd.  We just did our jobs as Christians and citizens."CONNECT
