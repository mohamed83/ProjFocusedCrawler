Sundance…. most Bible Belt churches have midweek services on Wednesday night. They are not “special” programs like you’re describing.  Many communities don’t schedule Wednesday night events because anything else would conflict with regularly scheduled church meetings for a lot of people. This is true of most all churches… Methodist, Baptist, non-denominational, AME Zion also, I’m pretty sure.

Doesn’t need to be a false flag.  With everything that’s been going on on the racial front in this country, you KNOW there’s gotta be a lot of borderline psychos out there who will take very little to put them over the edge.  You also KNOW that’s exactly what certain people (BGI, etc) WANT to happen.  They’ve already been screaming that the Klan is re-emerging (with very little actual evidence of that), so as horrible as this attack at the church is, I guarantee many of those in the BLM “movement” will GLADLY use this to their advantage.

I’m here with ya, only in the mountains.  It’s been in the low 90’s and I am melting.
That’s why I can’t fathom anyone wearing Timberlands and a sweatshirt and jeans.  Was he trying to disguise himself?  Pull off the sweats and boots to avoid being identified?
It’s just so weird.

“Active shooter” means someone who is still in the process of shooting, or believed to be in the process. No further shooting has happened here. It is believed that this shooter has fled or is in hiding.

I fear for this young man.  With the current anger index so high in the African-American community and his picture being put on the nightly news (and probably newspapers as well, certainly online) someone will not bother to read that he is NOT the shooter.  They will simply see him driving or walking somewhere and decide he shouldn’t be free and out on the streets.

So the cameraman was detained simply b/c he fit the description of the shooter:
*A white male was briefly detained at the Shell gas station at Meeting and Calhoun streets. Two loud pops were heard and a crowd of people rushed to the front of the gas station where they had the male on the ground and were handcuffing him.
The white male had on a backpack and was carrying a camera and recording device fell on the ground near where he was detained.
David Corrie, 21, of Ladson, said he was walking out of the store and the officers forced him to get down.
He said the officers told him they were just doing their jobs, and he fit the description*.
