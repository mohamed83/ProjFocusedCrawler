GRAPHIC WARNING: Some viewers may find the following images disturbing. Viewer discretion advised. 
INDIANAPOLIS (July 9, 2015) — Indianapolis Metropolitan police discussed video footage related to the death of a man in April during a police-involved shooting.
Mack Long, 36, was fatally shot after a traffic stop in the 3800 block of East 31st Street on Sunday, April 12. A coroner’s report said Long died from multiple gunshot wounds.  Two officers were injured in the incident. In June, a grand jury decided not to file charges in the case. The grand jury met twice while investigating.
Long’s family had requested police show them footage of the shooting. Thursday, Indianapolis Metropolitan police released video shot on body cameras of the incident.
The video never gives a clear view of Long during the encounter. However, Chief Rick Hite said the footage had enough evidence to show Long didn’t listen to commands before the shooting.
FOX59’s Jill Glavan will have more on this story throughout the day.
