38-year-old Bhoti Subba
SOUTH SALT LAKE, Utah – Police are investigating a suspicious death in South Salt Lake after finding a woman dead in her apartment.
Authorities were called to a home near 2890 S. and 200 E. at the Arda Jean Manor Apartments just before 8 p.m. Monday to check on a resident.
When authorities arrived, they found the body of 38-year-old Bhoti Subba; she was from Nepal.
Police said Subba’s family had called officers to check on her because they hadn’t heard from her since Friday.
Police have not confirmed how the woman died but they are saying the death is suspicious.
South Salt Lake Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne Ruth said, “It’s just an ongoing investigation; at this point we’re in the process of determining who her friends, who her family are and talking with them at this point.”
