3 arrested after armed robbery suspects fleeing from police crash SUV in Ogden


 


OGDEN, Utah – Three people were taken into custody by Ogden police late Thursday night after officers responded to a report of an aggravated robbery and the suspects fled the scene in a vehicle, which they later crashed.
According to a press release from the Ogden Police Department, officers responded to a couple who reported they were robbed at knife point around 11:41 p.m. in the area of 3rd and Washington Boulevard. The victims, a 34-year-old male and 21-year-old female, were not injured and the suspects had fled the scene in a 2000 Ford Explorer, green in color.
Officers responding to the area were able to locate the suspect vehicle and attempted to stop it, but the suspects did not stop and instead fled from police. After a short pursuit, the driver of the Explorer lost control and the vehicle crashed in the 2000 block of Washington Boulevard.
The SUV came to a rest on its side, and, according to the press release, “Due to the aggravating circumstances in the reported crime, officers used a non-lethal extended range kinetic energy impact beanbag round to break the rear window to the vehicle, allowing a safe exit for the suspects. Officers then safely removed three suspects.”
The suspects were detained. Two were identified as 30-year-old Javier Garcia and 20-year-old Daniel Herrera, and both were charged with aggravated robbery and possession of a dangerous weapon by a restricted person. The third suspect, 23-year-old Angelica Fresques, was charged with aggravated robbery and felony evading in a vehicle.
All three suspects were booked into the Weber County Jail.
