Former Sheriff John McGinness Weighs in on South Carolina Shooting

Local police brutality activists questioned general law enforcement protocols Thursday after viewing video of a deadly April 4 shooting in South Carolina park, in which a white Charleston police officer shot an unarmed black man in the back.
“Just the number of shots … I get the feeling if he hit him with the first shot, those next shots were still coming,” activist Jamier Sale of Natomas told FOX40.  “This isn’t just nationally, it’s local, too.”
Sale added that his sister, Maile Hampton, was recently arrested at an anti-police brutality protest for allegedly lynching, or removing someone from police custody.
Former Sacramento Sheriff John McGinness said it appears in the video that protocol was not followed.
“What I find most troubling is the conduct after the shooting,” McGinness said.
He questions why Michael Slager went back to pick up what video forensic experts estimate could be his Taser. After that, Slager appears to drop the Taser next to Walter Scott’s body.
“That is troubling,” McGinness said. “It shows you a few things. It shows consciousness of guilt, a term under the law that shows he knew what he was doing was wrong.”
McGinness emphasized that a different type of force should have been used.
“Chase him on foot. I would support [that] use of force. If needed… deliver blows to detain the subject and then take him into custody,” McGinness said.
FOX40 reached out to multiple local law enforcement officials who declined to comment on the video.
Slager is in custody in South Carolina and is not eligible for bail.
