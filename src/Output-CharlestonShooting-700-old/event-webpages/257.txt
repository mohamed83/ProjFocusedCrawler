The first funerals for victims of the Charleston shooting were held on Thursday, as the community honored the nine people who were gunned down at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church by an alleged white supremacist. 
Funerals are scheduled into next week. 
“I am here to tell you that we are stronger because we are together as a community,” Norvell Goff, Emanuel AME’s interim pastor, said at the service for Ethel Lance at Royal Missionary Baptist church in North Charleston. 
On Wednesday night, Goff led the weekly Bible study class where Lance and eight others were killed exactly a week before. Hundreds gathered in the church’s basement. 
“Many of our hearts our broken, but only God can fix a broken heart,” Goff said at the gathering. “That’s my testimony.”

Marjorie McIver, whose sister Myra Thompson died in the attack, attended Bible study, according to the Post and Courier. Thompson’s funeral will be held on Monday at the church. 
“God loves us,” McIver said. “He’s forgiven us of our sins. It behooves us to forgive others. That message of love, even for your enemies, even for those who use you, who despise you – that’s a powerful message.” 
Later on Thursday, the funeral for Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, a mother of three, was held at Mt Moriah Missionary Baptist church in North Charleston. Charleston’s mayor, Joe Riley, said Singleton was “one of those extraordinary people, a coach who taught life lessons”.
On Wednesday, thousands visited the state house rotunda, where Clementa Pinckney lay in state. Lawmakers paid their respects to the state senator and Emanuel AME pastor, as did his wife, Jennifer, and two daughters, Eliana and Malana. 
A large, black curtain hung in front of a window in the state house lobby, blocking from sight the Confederate flag that flies over a monument on the grounds. The push to take down the flag, and stop states from allowing it on license plates or flying it on government land, has gathered momentum since the shooting, which police say was racially motivated. 
Apple has removed war games with the Confederate flag from its app store, and the National Park Service said on Thursday it would remove all items that depict only the Confederate flag from its stores.
Many of the lawmakers who worked with Pinckney have said they want the flag taken down, but to do so would require a two-thirds majority vote from the legislature. Governor Nikki Haley has said she supports taking down the flag. Haley said on Twitter earlier this week: “July 4th is just around the corner. It will be fitting that our state Capitol will soon fly the flags of our country & state, and no other.” 
President Barack Obama, who said the flag “belongs in a museum”, is scheduled to deliver the eulogy at the funeral for Pinckney on Friday. The ceremony will take place at the College of Charleston, which can hold 5,400 people. The first lady, Michelle Obama, Vice-President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, are also set to attend.
Funerals for the other victims are scheduled into next week at Emanuel AME and in the state capital, Columbia, where the funeral of Daniel Simmons will be held. Funerals for Cynthia Hurd, Tywanza Sanders and his great aunt Susie Jackson will be held at Emanuel AME on Saturday.
On Thursday, the Charleston County council voted to rename the library Hurd managed in her honor. All 16 branches of the Charleston library will close for her funeral, so workers can attend the service. 
The funeral for DePayne Middleton-Doctor, who was known for her talents as a singer and preacher, will be held at Emanuel AME on Sunday.
