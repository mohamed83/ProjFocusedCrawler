That’s definitely a Great Value camera… You would think Wal-Mart could afford a better one.

That’s not theft that’s finders keepers ppl. If I find money and I don’t turn it in…like most ppl wouldn’t …. that makes me a jerk not a thief. That’s a shotty thing to do by not being honest and turning it in. Shes a dishonest person not a thief. She didn’t steal a purse or something from the store and personally in my opinion I feel this is abuse of surveillance video. Yes even if it was mine I’d think that because I feel we need to use that for real thieves and kidnappers etc.
