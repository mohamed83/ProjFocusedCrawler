TURLOCK —
A 22-year-old Turlock man is dead following a Thursday night shooting. On Friday, investigators were looking into whether nearly 200 pot plants found inside a home near the scene played a role in this tragedy.
Police officers said they received calls of a drive-by shooting near the intersection of Linwood Avenue and Baywood Lane around 11:30 p.m. That’s where they found the victim, Marcus Culebro. Investigators also found another man who was tied and beaten.
An empty beer can lay next to where police say Marcus Culebro took his last breath. The 22-year-old was shot Thursday after 11 p.m. when he and some friends arrived at a house near Linwood Avenue and Baywood Lane.
“It sounded like they were lighting fireworks at first,” Beno Garcia explained.
Neighbor Beno Garcia said he was watching TV at his home when he mistook the deadly shooting for a celebration, “I heard a commotion outside, I heard a car screech away and that’s when I decided to look outside,” the resident said, “I saw the guy lying under the tree and he had blood coming out of the neck, shoulder area.”
The Turlock Police Department claimed Culebro did not live here. Investigators are trying to piece together who is behind tragedy and what motivated the shooter.
“It’s an active investigation and we’ve received conflicting reports on the amount of suspects so we’re still trying to find that out,” Sgt. Stephen Webb, a Spokesman with the Turlock Police Department said.
As soon as officers checked the home, they found a man bound and beaten, “He was pretty shook up and he gave us limited information so he will be re-interviewed.”
Plus, 190 marijuana plants. Investigators said they’re unsure if the drugs are related to the deadly incident, “I never knew about the marijuana plants but that helps explain the traffic at night. People leaving the house, coming and going,” Garcia told FOX40.
If you have any information please contact the Turlock Police Department or Crimestoppers.
