Vehicle of interest
 
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (April 25, 2015) – Robert Woods, 82, was murdered inside his eastside Indianapolis residence Saturday morning.
The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department was dispatched to the 1400 block of North Edmondson Avenue on a report of a person shot just after 7:30 a.m. Woods lived in Crestwood Village Senior Community.
When officers arrived, they located Woods inside of his residence with multiple gunshot wounds. Woods was declared dead at the scene
Police say shots were fired from outside the building and went through a sliding glass door. Woods was hit multiple times.
Investigators say a shots fired call was reported on Friday night. When they responded, they did not find anything.
“They were not flagged down by anyone stating that anyone had been shot. They were called back and discovered some shell casings,” said IMPD Public Information Officer, Lt. Richard Riddle.
Homicide detectives have surveillance video of a vehicle of interest in this morning’s incident. They are looking for a silver or gray Jeep Cherokee. Police say it was seen on video entering the area of the apartment complex just minutes before the shots fired call.
“We’re certainly concerned that individuals who are willing to shoot into a residence and an 82-year-old victim was struck and killed as a result of the shooting. That causes us concern and that’s why we’re pleading with the public for anyone who has information on this to please give us a call,” Lt. Riddle said.
If you know anything you’re asked to call Crime Stoppers at 317-262-TIPS.
