Lightning storms moved through the area Tuesday night.At a news conference on Wednesday, Special Agent D. Craig Chillcott of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives urged patience as investigators did their work. “We haven’t ruled anything in or anything out at this point,” he said.The fire in this town of just 375 brings to seven the number of churches, six of them with predominantly African-American congregations, that have burned in the last 10 days in South and North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida. Two of those appear to have been caused by lightning, and another was electrical.Investigators have found no evidence that any of the fires are connected and no indications of hate crimes. At least two were deliberately set, investigators said, with two still of unclear origins.Despite such assurances, the fires have sent a chill through black congregations that are well aware of a long history of their churches being targeted for violence by racists. As recently as the 1990s, there was a wave of dozens of arson fires at black churches, mostly in the South. In 1995, arsonists burned Mount Zion’s previous home to the ground, and President Bill Clinton visited the church in 1996 to speak out against those crimes.Elected officials in South Carolina, many of them African-American, urged people not to rush to conclusions.“Things are often not what they seem,” Mount Zion’s pastor, the Rev. John Taylor, said. “Just wait and see. Speculation is never good.”All of the recent church fires broke out in the days after the fatal shootings of a pastor and eight members at a Charleston church. A 21-year-old man, Dylann Roof, has been charged in the shootings, which officials have labeled a hate crime.Alan Blinder reported from Greeleyville, and Richard Pérez-Peña from New York. Michael S.
