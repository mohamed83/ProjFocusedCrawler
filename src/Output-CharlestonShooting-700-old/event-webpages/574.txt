SACRAMENTO —
A young man is dead after being shot in the parking lot of Home Depot on Meadowview Road in Sacramento.
The Sacramento Police Department reports just after 11:20 Sunday morning a 20-year-old man was shot in his car by a person in another car. The suspect fled the scene in an older model sedan and has yet to be located.
Officer Justin Brown with the Sacramento Police Department said the incident is not being classified as a drive by shooting and the relationship between the victim and suspect is unknown.
Multiple shots were fired and hit the window of a nearby Wendy’s, but no one inside the restaurant was hurt.
Brown said at this time a motive has not been identified.
The Sac PD will continue to investigate.
