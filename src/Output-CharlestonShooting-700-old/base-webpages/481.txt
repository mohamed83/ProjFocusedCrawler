   Charleston Police Department Police released this image of the suspect who is at large.   





	A gunman was at large early Thursday after a prayer service became a massacre at a historic black church in South Carolina the night before.

Nine people were shot dead inside Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston Wednesday night. Police are calling the attack a hate crime.

EMANUEL AME CHURCH HAS LONG HISTORY, TIES TO SLAVE REBELLION

	The gunman — described as a white male between 21 and 25 — sat down at the service before standing and opening fire, the Post and Courierreported. He spared one woman so she could tell everyone what happened, Charleston NAACP President Dot Scott told the paper after speaking with her family.

	“This is a tragedy that no community should have to experience,” Charles Police Chief Gregory Mullen told media early Thursday while confirming the fatalitiesat the Mother Emanuel AME Church. “It is senseless and unfathomable that somebody in today’s society would walk into a church and take their lives.”

CHURCH MASSACRE VICTIM CLEMENTA PINCKNEY MOURNED ACROSS U.S.

	The massacre is one of worst mass shootings in the state's history.

	Charleston police released surveillance video of the suspect and hit getaway car. The five-foor-9 gunman has sandy blond hair and was wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and boots and sped away from the massacre scene in a blue car.

	“We have no reason to believe that he is not in the Charleston area,” Mullen said at a Thursday morning press conference, adding that officers are looking across the east coast for the gunman.

	Helicopters hovered over downtown Charleston overnight and officers moved door to door through the area with guns drawn during the overnight manhunt.

	Police responded to the church carnage around 9 p.m. Hours later, authorities pushed back members of the media while investigating a possible bomb threat, which was eventually cleared. Authorities denied local media reports that nearby residents were evacuated.

EDITORIAL: DYLANN ROOF IS A HOMEGROWN AMERICAN TERRORIST

	"This is a scary and sad moment for the community," Pastor John Paul Brown, who heads the Mount Zion AME Church four blocks from where the shooting happened, told the Daily News Wednesday night.

	Eight of the victims died in the church and the ninth died in a hospital, police said.

	Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley said speaking to the families of victims was the most “heartbreaking scene I’ve witnessed in my life.”

	“This is one hateful person that did these dastardly deeds,” Riley said of the unidentified suspect.

	Police did not identify any of the victims Thursday morning.

	The church’s pastor, Democratic State Sen. Clementa Pinckney, is among the dead, according to friends and colleagues. Authorities have not confirmed his death, butState House Minority leader Todd Rutherford told The Associated Press Pinckney was killed.
   South Carolina Legislature Democratic State Sen. Clementa C. Pinckney is the church's pastor. He is believed to have been in the church during the shooting, according to local media.   

	The Rev. Al Sharpton tweeted a tribute to Pinckney after midnight.

	“Rev. Clements (sic) Pinckney, a SC legislator is among the 9 killed in SC church. I am reminded that he helped lead our prayer vigil for Scott,” Sharpton wrote, referring to Walter Scott, a black man fatally shot by a white officer in North Charleston last April.

	Mother Emanuel calls itself “the oldest AME church in the south” on its website and its Holy City history dates back to 1816, according to the Post and Courier. The church holds a Bible study session every Wednesday at 6 p.m., its website says.

	The mass shooting drew stunned responses from political leaders around the state and nationwide.
   Rev. Al Sharpton/via Twitter Al Sharpton tweeted about Pinckney's death, which has not been confirmed by authorities.   

	“Charleston, you're in our thoughts tonight,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted.

	South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on Facebook: “While we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we'll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another. Please join us in lifting up the victims and their families with our love and prayers.”

     



	Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush announced soon after the shooting he is canceling a Charleston campaign stop that was scheduled for Thursday.

	"Our thoughts and prayers are with the individuals and families affected by the tragic events in Charleston," he tweeted.
