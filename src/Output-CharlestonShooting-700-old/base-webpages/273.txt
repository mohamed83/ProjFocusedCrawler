Obama's 'Amazing Grace' is a sign of music's powerful role in black churches

I am weary of watching a sitting president plead in public for Congress to proffer a solution to American gun violence; the Charleston massacre broke my spirit. I decided against watching President Obama’s eulogy for Senator Clementa Pickney in real time because it felt too sad for words, and yet words are most of what is promised at public spectacles of mourning.
Instead, I watched people’s reactions to it on social media as a way to pay my own respects to Pickney and the other victims and, throughout Obama’s eulogy, the emotional and analytical reactions played out much as I expected. But when Obama concluded by singing the popular Protestant church hymn “Amazing Grace,” something changed: the tenor and ferocity of what I was reading increased dramatically and, to my surprise, it was void of the snarky, crippling tone one might otherwise expect. 
People tweeted about the cultural and political significance of the performance to the minute musical details of his rendition, the vocal ornaments, the key signature (E-flat major) in which he “raised the song”, the Hammond B-3 organ and the audience’s heterophonic responses that spontaneously emerged and supported the president-turned-preacher. Even some of the African Americans that I know to be critical of President Obama’s policies seemed to strongly identify with the gesture of that song, at that moment, in that place. 
Obama’s “Amazing Grace” was, of course, immediately easy to find online, almost instantaneously separated from the context of the entire eulogy. It’s a fascinating testament to music’s power to absorb just about any connotation imaginable. 
Even with meticulous presidential event planning, it’s hard for me to imagine that Obama had to tell the organist what song he’d planned to sing or what key signature he’d prefer. By singing a spontaneous congregational song at the end of a sermon – the traditional emotional apex of the ritualized event – Obama performed a familiar trope that united his immediate audience – mostly black church-goers – with their history, that joined himself to that history, and that staged social solidarity among the musicians and the singing congregation. 
Everybody in that church understood his and her roles in the musical ritual, from the spontaneous “sing, brother” to the congregation’s en masse simultaneous embellishing of the melody with a mosaic of blue notes and metallic timbres. It wasn’t so much the choice of song that made the moment cathartic and meaningful, but the way in which Obama judiciously handled the melody and his peppering the song with vocal gestures of a stalwart and willing – if slightly musically insecure – deacon. It took musical courage and familiarity. Each note choice, inflection and bodily movement situated him within a tradition of a people whose songs were precious cultural capital and even life itself. When he called out the names of the Charleston Nine in his rhythmic, commanding flourish at the end of the song, Obama flirted with the sing-song style of master preachers of this tradition. 
Like many Chicagoans, I was well-acquainted with the teachings, community works and music ministry of the church of Obama’s erstwhile pastor, Rev Jeremiah Wright, with its unique mix of progressive liberation theologies tempered by time-honored music traditions of the black church; everybody in Chicago knew that the Trinity United Church of Christ had the best music. For the most part, African Americans were disappointed that Obama, during and after his 2008 presidential campaign, apparently felt he had to abandon the moaning, chanting and call-and-response sounds of his chosen religious practice in order to convince a skeptical public that he could be the president of “all” Americans. He literally threw the riffs and blue notes out with the bath water. 
The late American poet Amiri Baraka wrote in his classic book Blues People that, in black music, “the people and the music is the same.” In the current moment ideas about the construction of social identities are circulating fast and furiously; the question, “Who are you?” seems to be constantly debated. The Black Lives Matter movement has successful moved the debate of black humanity and citizenship to the front of these concerns. 
An individual’s emotional health and survival often depend on our feeling deeply connected to others. The music scholar Thomas Turino has taught us that performances like the ones represented by Obama’s “Amazing Grace” are arenas in which social intimacy is achieved and during which we experience oneness with others. As a man who has had his loyalties, cultural literacy, political alliances, family background, religious affiliation and even birth circumstances questioned at every turn, I can imagine the space created in this ritualized performance did some important emotional and cultural work for Obama, just as it did for the grieving families and the larger audience. Music works when words are not enough.
