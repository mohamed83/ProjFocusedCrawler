The anonymous bystander hailed as a hero for capturing video footage of Walter Scott being shot dead by a police officer in South Carolina is prepared to speak publicly about what he saw, according to an attorney for Scott’s family.
L Chris Stewart said the man, who has not yet been named, has retained a lawyer and is assisting the state investigators who are conducting an inquiry into the alleged murder of Scott by patrolman Michael Slager of North Charleston police.

“That person will speak at some point,” Stewart told reporters. “Right now, they’re working with the investigating agency, they have an attorney.”
Stewart said the man, who can be seen on the footage scrambling to record the confrontation between Scott, 50, and Slager, 33, had been heroic to come forward with evidence that will be central to the prosecution of the officer, who has been charged with murder. 
“We have to really recognise the strength and fortitude and fearlessness that it took to come forward when you know you just filmed a police officer murder somebody,” he said, adding that the man’s actions “should be respected throughout this country”.
“That’s the kind of person that needs to be duplicated,” Stewart said.
The man’s voice can be heard at some points during the video footage as he realises the gravity of what he has witnessed. At one stage an alert tone appears to come from his phone as he continues to record.
“Oh shit, oh shit, shit,” the man says, after Slager finishes firing and approaches Scott’s body. “Fucking abuse,” he appears to add. “Fucking abuse, man.” Finally he appears to say: “Shit, he was shot.”

He is understood to have contacted Scott’s family following early reports of the shooting, which did not tally with what he had recorded. Police told the media Scott was shot after stealing Slager’s Taser – a claim seemingly contradicted by the cellphone footage.
South Carolina representative Justin Bamberg, an attorney who is assisting the Scott family, said the footage should put pressure on fellow members of the state legislature to pass a law forcing police officers to wear body cameras recording their actions.
“Had this witness not shown the courage that he showed, and come forward, would we be standing here?” said Bamberg. “It is very arguable that with body cameras on law enforcement, we won’t have to depend on the courage of a random stranger who happens to witness something happen.”
The footage was turned over to authorities by the Scott family’s legal team. They are understood to have also passed the footage to media on Tuesday in advance of a press conference, where Stewart made his remarks about the man who filmed it.
