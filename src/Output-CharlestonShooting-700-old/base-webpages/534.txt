US president Barack Obama has pointed to the effectiveness of Australia’s gun laws while lamenting the US’s apparent tolerance for frequent mass shootings.
Speaking to comedian Marc Maron, Obama discussed the recent Charleston church shootings, where 21-year-old Dylann Roof is alleged to have shot and killed nine people. Roof spent an hour with the Bible study group before pulling a gun out of his backpack and opening fire.
Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder, and has been linked to online racist manifestos espousing white supremacy.
Obama said there was “no other advanced nation on Earth” that tolerated and considered normal such frequent mass shootings.
“The truth of the matter is this doesn’t happen with this kind of frequency in other countries,” he told Maron, who interviewed Obama on Friday for his podcast.
“When Australia had a mass killing – I think it was in Tasmania – about 25 years ago, it was just so shocking the entire country said ‘well we’re going to completely change our gun laws’, and they did. And it hasn’t happened since.”
In the wake of the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, when Martin Bryant shot and killed 35 people and wounded 23, prime minister John Howard pushed through laws banning automatic, semi-automatic and pump action guns, and enacted a comprehensive gun buy-back scheme, despite strong opposition from parts of the Australian community.
Obama was not optimistic about such changes occurring in the US.
“I don’t foresee any legislative action being taken in this Congress,” he said. “And I don’t foresee any real action until the American public feels a sufficient sense of urgency and they say to themselves, ‘This is not normal, this is something that we can change and we’re going to change it’.”
Obama also lamented the rush of Americans who go and buy firearms after US shootings and the “extremely strong” grip the powerful lobby group the National Rifle Association has on Congress.
