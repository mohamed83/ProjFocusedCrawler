Worshippers embrace following a group prayer across the street from the scene of the shooting (AP)  "It will be investigated as a hate crime," he said.

 A helicopter hovered overhead as police sealed off streets around the church.  The website for the church said it has one of the largest and oldest black congregations in the region.  The church was built in 1891 and is considered a historically significant building, according to the National Park Service.   A small prayer circle forms close to the shooting at the Emanuel AME Church (AP)  Charleston is known locally as "The Holy City," due to its large number of churches and historical mix of immigrant ethnic groups that brought a variety of creeds to the southern city on the Atlantic coast.  • South Carolina officer who shot black suspect is charged with murder  Local reports said a Bible study group met on Wednesday evenings.   Local ministers comfort each other near the site of the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist (AME) Episcopal Church (EPA)  Police briefly detained a man who matched the description of the gunman, however, he was identified as a local photographer and the search continued.

 A group of several men stood in a circle in front of a hotel near the church. "We pray for the families, they've got a long road ahead of them," Reverend James Johnson, a local civil rights activist, said during the impromptu prayer service.  Race relations have been under intense scrutiny during the past year, a period marked by protests at police brutality directed at young, black men.
