This extraordinary video shows the moment Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof was arrested by armed police.
Cops can be seen following a black car after receiving a call from somebody suspecting that the man who allegedly killed nine innocent churchgoers was inside.
Video footage from the officer’s dashboard camera shows cops pull over the suspected racist gunman in Shelby, North Carolina.
One officer then pulls Roof - who had been on the run for 14 hours - out of the vehicle before he is frisked. Despite being the centre of a huge police manhunt both the cops and Roof seem remarkably relaxed.
Eventually Roof is placed in a police car before a group of officers show their relief by high-fiving each other.

It has since emerged that Roof was given a Burger King meal by police after his arrest.
The confessed killer told officers who seized him he was hungry and had not eaten since before the attack.
Police chief Jeff Ledford said they bought him food from a nearby Burger King .
“He was very quiet, very calm. He didn’t talk,” Ledford said. “He sat very quietly.”
Hours after shooting nine churchgoers dead, racist gunman Dylann Roof was treated to a Burger King meal by police.
The confessed killer complained of being hungry following his arrest after carrying out his massacre at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina last Wednesday.

After the shooting he fled in his black Hyundai car 250 miles north where he was finally apprehended in Shelby after 14 hours on the run.
Now the police chief whose officers arrested Roof has revealed cops bought him a Burger King meal after he said he hadn’t eaten since carrying out the assault.
Jeff Ledford said the killer refused to answer any question put to him by his staff and that the only conversation he had was about food.
Ledford said police bought him food from a nearby Burger King. “He was very quiet, very calm. He didn’t talk,” Ledford said. “He sat down here very quietly. He was not problematic.”
Roof had been found with .45-calibre handgun in his car and told armed police “I am Dylann Roof” when he was arrested.
He is reported to have shown no remorse and expressed racist views as he later confessed to the crime to the FBI.

The gunman has since been charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a firearm in the commission of of violent crime.
If found guilty prosecutors as well as South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley have said they will seek the death penalty.
It comes as the relatives Roof’s victim told him during his first court appearance on Friday they forgave him for the killings.
Many have said they would not want him sent to the death chamber.
Roof is currently being held in solitary confinement, where he is under 24-hour watch and only allowed out of his cell for 60 minutes a day.
As yet he has had no visits from his family or friends with the only person who has talked to him has being his lawyer.
His cell is next to the one holding former cop Michael Slager - the policeman accused of gunning down unarmed black man Walter Scott in April.

Roof, 21, is in cell 1141B at Charleston County Jail.
Slager, 33, who was seen on video shooting Mr Scott in the back, is in 1140B.
Sources at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Centre have said the two killers can talk to each other through shouting but both have refused.
“Roof is sitting quietly in his cell and not saying a word,” said the insider.
“The only person he has conversed with is his lawyer.
“It seems everyone else has washed their hands of him.
“He remains on suicide watch.”
