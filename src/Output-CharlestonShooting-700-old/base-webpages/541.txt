    Speaking for the first time in court, the state-appointed psychiatrist for James Holmes says the Aurora theater shooting suspect has a mental illness but can tell right from wrong. Jurors also saw recordings of part of their interview sessions.

        COMMENTEMAILMORECENTENNIAL, Colo. — James Holmes' heart and mind are being laid bare before the world.Prosecutors earlier this week introduced Holmes' personal notebook into evidence, one in which he detailed plans to attack a suburban Denver movie theater but also repeatedly wrote "why, why, why." And Thursday, they began playing more than 20 hours of video recordings of his interviews with a court-appointed psychiatrist at the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo.Holmes faces the death penalty in connection with the 12 deaths and 70 injuries July 20, 2012."Despite my biological shortcomings, I have fought and fought. Always defending against predetermination and the fallibility of man," Holmes wrote in his notebook. "There is more one battle to fight with life. To face death, embrace the longstanding hatred of mankind and overcome all fear in certain death."Holmes mailed the notebook to a university psychiatrist he had seen repeatedly during his time as a neuroscience doctoral student, and investigators discovered it, envelope unopened, hours after the shooting. The notebook contains stick-figure drawings, sketches of the theater and its auditoriums, and even estimates of how long it would take police to arrive.USA TODAYClassmate: Accused theater shooter not always relevantHolmes also wrote the infinity symbol repeatedly, obsessed about the meaning and value of life, and intellectually explored other killings, such as murdering hikers after shocking them with a stun gun."I was fear incarnate, love gone, motivation directed to hate and obsessions," he wrote toward the end of the notebook. "No consequences, no fear, alone, isolated, no work for distractions, no reason to see self actualization. Embraced the hatred, a dark knight rises."“It's not just about the action. You have to look at the state of mind. You have to put everything together.
”Dr. Carl Clark, Mental Health Center of DenverBecause Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, he had to undergo a mental-health examination. The independent doctor that the state selected found him mentally ill but sane, as did a prosecution-selected doctor.One commissioned by defense lawyers concluded that he suffers from schizophrenia and legally can't be held responsible.Mental-health experts consulted by USA TODAY say evaluations such as the ones Holmes underwent focus on the defendant's state of mind shortly before, during and after an incident.Dr. William Reid, the independent examiner that the court chose, interviewed Holmes two years after the shootings. Reid used to run the Texas state mental health system, and normally testifies as a defense witness.In a portion of the video examination conducted by Reid and previously played in court, Holmes said he believed that killing people would increase his self-worth. By the time of the interview, Holmes' dyed orange hair had returned to its natural reddish-brown color, and he was taking several medications to combat depression and psychotic episodes."I only count fatalities," a sullen-looking Holmes said in one interview. Asked about the injured, he responded: "They're collateral damage, I guess."USA TODAYAccused Aurora shooter says he had a 'broken mind'Testimony about Holmes' mental state has been interspersed in the entire trial with victims telling tearful stories of the devastation he unleashed while they sat in a darkened movie theater eagerly awaiting a summer blockbuster. Lucas Smith, who was sitting with his wife when the shooting began, described shotgun pellets hitting him in the leg."I thought I was going to die," Smith said from the witness stand, just a few feet away from where Holmes sat shackled to the floor.Sanity evaluations are judgement calls, said Dr. Carl Clark, the president and chief executive of the Mental Health Center of Denver. Clark, who has performed sanity exams for the state hospital, said it's human nature for jurors to seek simple answers.USA TODAYCoroner describes bodies of theater shooting victimsForensic mental health exams focus on the subject's mental state immediately before, during and after a crime, he said. Clark has been monitoring the case but has not examined Holmes."It's not just about the action. You have to look at the state of mind," he said. "You have to put everything together."For instance, a forensic examiner might conclude someone is sane if he hides the body and disposes of the murder weapon after killing someone because the actions suggest he knew what he had done was wrong. In contrast, Colorado officials recently declined to prosecute a man suffering from Alzheimer's disease who beat his nursing-home roommate to death but seemed to be unaware of what he had done despite being covered in blood."They will have to make a judgement about this. And all important decisions are based on insufficient information," Clark said. "It doesn't matter how long this trial goes on, there will still be gray areas."
