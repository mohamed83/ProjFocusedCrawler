Share Anywhere
Share to any service, or add a custom service to share to. AddToAny gets people to the right destination to share or save your content, whether it's in a native app or on the web.



Mobile & Responsive
Universal menus react instantly to taps, clicks, and multiple forms of input and device orientations. Sharing on mobile lets you choose between a service's mobile app or mobile site.



Perfect Icons
AddToAny icons are Scalable Vector Graphics, meaning they load fast, are mathematically precise, scalable to any size, and are stunning on High-PPI screens such as Retina and Retina HD displays.



Built For Good
AddToAny's lightweight code follows best practices, and is optimized to load efficiently from locations all around the world. Accessibility, cross-browser fallbacks, graceful degradation are a few AddToAny staples.



Google Analytics Integrated
Sharing stats automatically roll into your Google Analytics, tying into your other metrics in one dashboard.



No Account Necessary
AddToAny just works. No registration, and no user accounts to manage.



Share Counters
Official counts alongside your share buttons. AddToAny counters in the same style show numbers directly from major services.



Floating Share Bars
Encourage visitors to share your content with a special share buttons bar that stays in place as you scroll.



Plugins That Delight
Open source plugins for WordPress, Drupal, etc. are tailored to each platform. AddToAny plugins load asynchronously, so your content loads first or in parallel with AddToAny.



Highly Customizable
Designed for customization, AddToAny supports color & style overrides, event handling, URL shorteners, email templates, custom integrations, usually the next big thing, and much more.
