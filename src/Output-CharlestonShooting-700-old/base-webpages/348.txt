									BREAKING REPORTS: Mass Shooting In N. Charleston South Carolina…							


Centinel2012:Lets hope this is not the start of more violence started by the agenda driven administration.
Originally posted on The Last Refuge:
Sketchy details, but possibly 8 people deceased.  In Charleston SC there is a MASSIVE response, including confirmation of FBI, to a mass casualty shooting event being described as taking place in a church.    Initial ground reports are the LEO response units are severely distressed at what has been found so far.
