        COMMENTEMAILMOREMacon Bibb County's Fire Chief Marvin Riggins says the fire that gutted a church Tuesday appears to be suspicious.  The fire is currently being investigated as an arson.Riggins says investigators believe they've eliminated accidental causes for the fire, like electrical problems.God's Power Church of Christ caught fire around 4:30 Tuesday morning. The church is on Cedar Avenue off Mercer University Drive.Nobody was injured, but Riggins says the church may be a total loss. The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was on the scene, which is standard procedure for church fires, and they brought an accelerant-sniffing dog.Associate Pastor Jeanette Dudley says she was shocked by the fire at the place she calls a second home."What's the church doing on fire? That was my response to it," she said. "I just couldn't believe it and once I got here, I did, I cried. I cried for a little bit."The God's Power Church of Christ caught fire around 4:30 Tuesday morning. (Photo: Sheera Poelman, 13WMAZ)

"If we turn back we gonna wanna stop. And if we stop then nothing is gonna be accomplished. It's like the devil gonna win."Pastor Lillie Powell says she founded the church more than 20 years ago and hopes to see it rebuilt soon. "I want this church to be put back like it was so we can continue to use this church," said Powell. Powell says for now they will host services at the church's other location in Danville in Twiggs County. Corey Reeves says Powell, his great-grandmother, built the church and it means a lot to his family. "She started out with a small shack then she expanded it as she started growing church members," Powell said. "Then after a little while of having church in Danville the lord led her to Cedar Avenue."Agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were on the scene Tuesday afternoon investigating the cause. That's standard procedure for church fires nationwide. They brought in a dog trained to sniff out accelerants that may have been used to start the blaze.  Macon-Bibb County Fire Chief Marvin Riggins says they believe the fire started at the back of the church."Penetrating through across the roof area and at that point in time the initial crew made an attack," he said. "It took us probably about an hour or so to get the fire under control at this point in time."Dudley adds that they will hold services at their second location in Twiggs County until they decide whether to rebuild. Riggins says fire investigators are interviewing the congregation and neighbors.He says they are offering a $10,000 reward for more information.You can call the Georgia Arson Control hotline at 1-800-282-5804. ________________________________The God's Power Church of Christ caught fire around 4:30 Tuesday morning, according to Fire Chief Marvin Riggins.
    The God's Power Church of Christ caught fire around 4:30 Tuesday morning
    The church is located on Cedar Avenue, near Pio Nono Ave.Fire crews contained the flames within an hour, but Riggins says it's still unclear if the building is salvageable. He says most of the damage is on the roof and in the rear of the building.The assistant pastor of the church, Jeanette Dudley, says God's Power Church of Christ opened another location in Danville recently. She told 13WMAZ  church leaders will have to decide whether to rebuild or just move the entire congregation to the Danville church.No one was injured in the fire. The cause is still under investigation.We'll have more details on this developing story as they become available.
