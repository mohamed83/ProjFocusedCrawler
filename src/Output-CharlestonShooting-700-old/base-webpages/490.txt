        COMMENTEMAILMOREReading some national reports and social media posts, it would seem that the loss of a predominantly black church in Tallahassee to a fire last Friday was caused by racially motivated arson.But that's not the case, investigators say.In the weeks following the fatal shooting of nine people at Charleston, South Carolina's Emanuel AME Church, there have been stories in national publications about black churches being targeted by arsonists. The recent Tallahassee church fire has been cited among those incidents.While there have been six recent church fires in Southern states, only a handful of them have been attributed to arson.The fire that consumed Greater Miracle Temple in Tallahassee began when a tree fell on electrical wiring. The electricity arced and ignited the blaze, according to the State Fire Marshal's Office, which is leading the investigation.TALLAHASSEE DEMOCRAT'Call 911. This church is on fire': Sign foretells blazeThe side of the St. Marks Street building is charred where the wires once connected. A still-green pecan tree lay on its side after it fell during heavy rains.Buy PhotoA fire at Greater Miracle Temple in Tallahassee has been linked to an exposed electrical wire caused by a falling treeÂ (Photo: Karl Etters/Democrat)Strangely enough, for the past two months the church's sign had read "Call 911. This church is on fire."Although the final report on the fire has not been completed, investigators are positive it was not intentionally set."I can confirm that the fire that occurred at the church on St. Marks Street is accidental," said State Fire Marshal Research Analyst Kayla Anderson. "A tree branch fell onto some electrical wires, which started the fire."
