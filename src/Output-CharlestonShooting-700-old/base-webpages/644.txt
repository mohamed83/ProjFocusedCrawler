WASHINGTON, D.C. — In the wake of the Charleston, S.C., church shooting that left nine people dead, President Barack Obama suggested Thursday that more gun control is needed to avoid similar mass killings.
“We do know that once again, innocent people were killed in part because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun,” Obama said at the White House.
“At some point, we as a people will have to reckon with the fact that this kind of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency. It is in our power to do something about it.”
With Vice President Joe Biden standing alongside him, Obama said, “Any death of this sort is a tragedy. Any shooting involving multiple victims is a tragedy. There is something particularly heartbreaking about death happening in a place in which we seek solace, we seek peace.”
