Charleston shooting impacts Missouri governor’s race


 


ST. LOUIS COUNTY, MO (KTVI) – The aftermath of Wednesday’s deadly church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina is having an affect on the 2016 race for governor here in the Show-Me State.
South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, a star in the Republican Party since her election there in 2011, was to be the headliner at a fundraiser for Catherine Hanaway, a GOP contender for Missouri governor, Thursday night in west St. Louis County. That event was postponed after Wednesday’s shooting.
Haley was in Charleston Thursday to meet with local officials, all trying to help that community come to grips with the deaths of nine people at Emanuel A.M.E. Church. A suspect was apprehended in North Carolina Thursday morning.
News of the impact on the Hanaway event was first reported by PoliticMO.
A campaign spokesman tells FOX2 the event, with Governor Haley’s participation, will be rescheduled. Hanaway is in a crowded primary field that includes State Senator Mike Parson and former State Rep. Randy Asbury. St. Louis businessman John Brunner, former Navy SEAL Eric Greitens, and Lt. Governor Peter Kinder are all exploring entry into a race that has been of national interest since State Auditor Tom Schweich, an early front-runner, took his own life this spring.
