Woman climbs pole and removes 'racist' Confederate flag after 9 killed in Charleston church massacre

A woman has been hailed a heroine after scaling a 30ft flagpole to remove a 'racist' Confederate flag in South Carolina. Bree Newsome, along with James Ian Tyson, negotiated a wrought-iron fence to pull off the stunt in the grounds of the South Carolina Statehouse. "We can extinguish hatred, oppression and malice... in the name of God, this flag comes down today," she said at the top of the pole. There have been calls to remove the flag since nine black churchgoers were killed in a racist attack at a Charleston church last week in the state. 


Planned stunt: Bree scales flagpole


 State Capitol police, addressing Newsome as ma'am, asked her to climb down several times as she inched her way up. When she descended she and Tyson were arrested and led away peacefully. They have since been freed after posting bail, but charges against them have not been dropped. 


Symbolic: She descends with flag


         “We removed the flag today because we can’t wait any longer,” Bree said in a press release. “We can’t continue like this another day. "It’s time for a new chapter where we are sincere about dismantling white supremacy and building toward true racial justice and equality.” A new Confederate flag, protected by state law, was raised an hour after the stunt. 


Arrested: Bree is led away


 “The confederate flag was born out of a government defending the enslavement of Black people and resurrected as an emblem for whites violently opposing racial integration,” read a statement from colorofchange.org. “Any government that recognizes the flag is declaring that it cherishes a history of racial terror. “Taking down the flag is just one step but a symbolically meaningful one. "Make no mistake about it, however, racism isn’t just a flag or words it’s baked into our economy and inequities in our democracy and criminal justice system."

 Later on Saturday several dozen supporters of the flag held a rally at the Statehouse. The event was planned before Newsome's stunt. The statement continued: “South Carolina officials have sided with white supremacists in choosing to restore the flag before a planned rally. “The legislature must immediately vote to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the capitol and all state buildings.”

  Ryan Hughes, who attended the rally, said the people demanding its removal should view it simply as a symbol of Southern history. "They are wrong," Hughes said. "They need a history lesson. They need to go back and look at what this flag really stands for, and that is state's rights. "That's freedom from tyranny. That's freedom from subjugation from the federal government." Demonstrators also attended but there was no violence Last week South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley called on lawmakers to remove the Confederate flag, which white supremacist Dylann Roof posed with prior to his alleged church murder spree.
