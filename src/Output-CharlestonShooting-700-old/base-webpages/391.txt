Dylann Roof is suspected of killing nine people inside a Charleston church



The suspect being hunted by police after nine people were killed in a horrific church shooting has been captured by police.
Dylann Roof, 21, was named by the FBI this afternoon as the suspect behind the shootings inside a Charleston church last night.
FBI agents flooded his neighbourhood as they desperately tried to find the suspect.
It has now emerged he has been captured in Shelby, Charlotte, and taken into custody.
Roof's uncle this afternoon revealed Roof had received a gun as a birthday present by his father in April.
Uncle Carson Cowles said he recognized Roof in a photo released by police, and described him as quiet and soft-spoken.

Charleston Police issued surveillance photos of the suspect earlier today



He added that Roof’s father gave him a .45-caliber pistol for his birthday this year.
Eye witnesses to the massacre on Wednesday night recounted how the 21-year-old remained “as cold as ice” as he opened fire killing three men and six women.
One female survivor said the killer reloaded five different times and at one point was spoken to by the son of a churchgoer who tried "talk him out of doing the act of killing people."
As he began unloading he told them: “I have to do this.

“You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go.”
They also recalled how he told one parishioner to “tell the world” what they had seen and how an elderly women told her granddaughter to play dead when the shooter started firing.
Following the massacre, officers also investigated a possible bomb threat but several hours later gave the all-clear.

Eight victims were found dead in the church, Chief Gregory Mullen told reporters at a media conference, and a ninth person died after being taken to a hospital.
One other person was wounded and receiving treatment following the shocking incident in Charleston, South Carolina.
Mullen said: "It is unfathomable that somebody in today's society would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives."
But the Reverend Al Sharpton, the New York-based civil rights leader, said in a Tweet that the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, the church's pastor and a member of the state Senate, was among the fatalities.

Mr Pinckney was a 41-year-old state senator, married and a father of two.
The shooting occurred at the Emanuel AME Church in the historic centre of downtown Charleston around 9pm local time (1am GMT), according to Charleston Police Department spokesman Charles Francis.

A police chaplain was present at the scene of the shooting, and a helicopter with a searchlight hovered overhead as officers combed through the area.
"We pray for the families, they've got a long road ahead of them," Reverend James Johnson, a local civil rights activist, said during the impromptu prayer service.
 
Following the attack on the church, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, canceled an appearance in Charleston that had been scheduled for Thursday morning.
"Governor Bush's thoughts and prayers are with the individuals and families affected by this tragedy," his campaign team said in a statement.

The website for the church said it has one of the largest and oldest black congregations in the south. It has its roots in the early 19th century, and the current building was built in 1891.
It is considered a historically significant building, according to the National Park Service.
