        COMMENTEMAILMORECENTENNIAL, Colo. — A mental-health professional who had James Holmes in therapy before he carried out his deadly attack on a Colorado movie theater considered his behavior bizarre after meeting with him for seven sessions over three months, the psychiatrist said Tuesday as she testified in Holmes' trial.Dr. Lynne Fenton saw Holmes five times alone and twice with a male psychiatrist in 2012 while he was a neuroscience graduate student at the University of Colorado, starting two weeks after he and his most recent girlfriend broke up.Initially, Fenton was told that Holmes was seeking treatment for anxiety in social situation. She prescribed medication for depression and anxiety and was trying to find the right combination of drugs to help him, based on his feedback about effectiveness and side effects.USA TODAYJuror's relative shot; she's taken off Colo. shooting trialAt one point in his first appointment, Holmes told Fenton that he had obsessive thoughts about killing people, and they were worse than ever, so homicide was the only solution to his biological problem."You can't kill everyone, so that's not an effective solution," Fenton said Holmes told her. She thought Holmes was dismissing the possibility of acting on his impulses, so she didn't consider his musings a real threat. When she asked him whether he wanted to hurt himself, he said no.“Just some of his remarks, … it felt like he didn't want to come for treatment with us, and he didn't like us.”Dr. Lynne Fenton, James Holmes' psychiatristHer testimony has been highly anticipated in what will be a months-long trial to determine whether Holmes, who has acknowledged that he was the gunman in a July 20, 2012, attack in a darkened movie theater that killed 12 people and injured 70 others, should be put to death. Fenton never has spoken publicly about their sessions.She remains bound by the trial judge's gag order, and a civil suit on hold until this trial is over contends that she should have done more to stop Holmes. But Holmes waived his patient-client privilege when he pleaded not guilty to the crimes in Aurora, Colo., by reason of insanity, opening the door for Fenton to testify.In early May, Fenton had asked Holmes to be allowed to bring another doctor into his treatment in hopes that he could relate better to a man, she said.Holmes' reaction? "Oh, it'll be to lock me up," which she assured him wasn't true. So Dr. Robert Feinstein joined their sessions on May 31 and June 11, 2012.By Holmes' fourth session on April 17, 2012, Fenton suggested that he try an anti-psychotic drug. He resisted.Feinstein asked again in Holmes' May 31, 2012, session. Holmes said no."He seemed to be not interested in treatment that Dr. Feinstein and I were offering," Fenton said on the stand. "And just some of his remarks, … It felt like he didn't want to come for treatment with us, and he didn't like us."USA TODAYFormer female friend testifies Holmes talked about killingAt the end of Holmes' June 11, 2012, session, both doctors offered to see their patient again for free. He said no though they expressed to him their concern that he was having a nervous breakdown.Afterward, Fenton said she called Holmes' mother, violating the privacy rules of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, to determine whether his behavior was new. Holmes' mother told Fenton that he always has been shy and socially awkward and became worse when they moved from a small town to San Diego.This screenshot made from a pdf released by the Colorado Judicial Department on May 27, 2015, shows a portion of Aurora shooter James Holmes' notebook after it was presented as evidence in his murder trial in Centennial, Colo. (Photo: AP)"I thought it was less likely that this was some sort of new psychotic break," Fenton said. "He been that way since he was a child."Holmes has said he kept Fenton in the dark on purpose as he plotted his attack.He never told her about the arsenal of weapons he was assembling. His elaborate schemes and to-do lists were kept in a journal that he didn't send to her until hours before his assault, and it lingered in a campus mailroom for days before being delivered to her.Because she didn't know of those preparations, she didn't move to have him committed to a psychiatric facility for 72 hours for evaluation.She initially was concerned he had a social phobia, considered the possibility of Asberger's syndrome on the autism spectrum and ultimately thought his diagnosis was schizoid personality disorder — a condition in which a person shows little emotion, avoids social activities and consistently shies away from interaction with others."He said, 'I don't have relationships with people; they have relationships with me,' " Fenton said. "I was worried that he would drop out of treatment at any time."Holmes would show emotion in text messages, such as his anger when she wrote the wrong surname on one of his prescriptions, causing her to have to call it in again to the pharmacy. Included in his texts to her about the problem were emoticons that translated into Q's on her screen but were really fists, "punching her in the eye," she said he told her.USA TODAY'Not morally wrong,' Aurora theater gunman saysYet when Holmes later told Fenton and Feinstein that he had failed his final exams, she described Holmes' reaction as "inappropriately nonchalant." He didn't study, instead he played the video game Diablo III for 100 hours in the two weeks beforehand and read up on Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Tylenol murderer James William Lewis.Other students would have exhibited far more stress about their academics and their future, she said. Holmes told her he planned to drop out of his doctoral program but stay in town and get a job until November because he didn't want to break his lease.Only in his final appointment, which included Feinstein, did Holmes have an "angry edge" to his voice, Fenton said.USA TODAYAurora shooting defendant went on 'autopilot'"Well, Fenton is clearly afraid of me," Fenton said of Holmes' exchange, consulting her notes. "That's why she asked you here. To protect her or something."But she had made notes to look into Holmes' "psychotic-level thinking," thoughts not based in reality, because of many odd statements he was uttering.Defense lawyers, who say Holmes suffers schizophrenia and was in the grips of a psychotic episode at the time of the attack, cross examined Fenton at length.Two court-appointed psychiatrists concluded he was sane at the time. Questions remain about whether anyone could have stopped him.Holmes' list for sessions with Fenton included: "Prevent building false sense of rapport … deflect incriminating questions … can't tell the mind rapists plan."USA TODAYHolmes found 'purpose' in Aurora theater shootingFenton contacted a campus-wide threat assessment team in June 2012, more than a month before the attack and told a campus police officer about her concerns after Holmes sent her threatening e-mail. However, she rejected the officer's offer to arrest Holmes and place him on a 72-hour psychiatric hold, according to the civil suit.In interviews with one of the two court-appointed doctors two years after the shooting, Holmes said he kept Fenton at bay. He didn't go out of his way to build rapport, seeing their relationship as artificial, he said."I kind of regret that she didn't lock me up so that everything could have been avoided," Holmes told Dr. William Reid.Contributing: The Associated Press
