Wedding: 'Amber and Michael' (left) said Dylann Roof's actions (right) had forced them to cancel their wedding











The sister of the gunman who killed nine people in Charleston church massacre has reportedly launched a fundraising page on social media to pay for her wedding.       A GoFundMe page in the name of Amber Roof has requested donations to pay for her marriage to partner Michael which was cancelled following the shootings last month. In the post Amber says her wedding day, which was originally planned for June 21, had been "tainted by the actions of one man". 


Money: Around $16,00 had been raised by the time the page was taken down


                 Dylann Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder following the gun attack on the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. On the wedding fundraising page 'Amber and Michael' say the media "abused our privacy" by publishing details of their wedding, the BBC and that they had cancelled the event "to protect our family and mourn the lives of those lost".   They said the donations would be used "to cover lost wedding costs, to pay bills, and to send us on our dream honeymoon."

Ten per cent of the money raised would be donated by the couple to the church Dylann Roof attacked, the couple said. The fundraising page was taken down earlier today, but had raised about $1,600 by then. The target was set at $5,000.       GoFundMe told the BBC the page was taken down by the user, not by the firm.   South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley has called for 21-year-old Dylann Roof to face the death penalty.
