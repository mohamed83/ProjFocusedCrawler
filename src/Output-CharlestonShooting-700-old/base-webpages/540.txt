        COMMENTEMAILMORECENTENNIAL, Colo. — A judge dismissed three jurors dismissed Tuesday in the Colorado theater shooting trial after one woman said she overheard another juror talking about information gleaned in news reports.The trial came to a halt as the information was presented and lawyers on both sides deliberated about the next step. In the end, Judge Carlos Samour Jr. of the 18th Judicial Circuit decided that Juror 872, whose husband asked her in a speakerphone call about information he saw on Facebook and Twitter; and Jurors 412 and 495, whom the judge determined heard the phone call, had to go to preserve the jury's impartiality.Juror 872 is a mother of three who doesn't watch the news and is OK with the death penalty.Defense lawyers also wanted to cut Juror 673, who reported the incident. But Samour said no.USA TODAY'Not morally wrong,' Aurora theater gunman saysA 30-minute recess to discuss the development became longer, and the judge eventually decided to call for a lunch break."This is a significant problem that Judge Carlos Samour has to resolve," legal analyst Scott Robinson said.“I would not want to be the husband ... or the wife of that husband. They're going to have an uncomfortable night or two.”Scott Robinson, legal analystRobinson expected the defense team to ask for a mistrial, but lawyers for James Holmes, who acknowledged killing 12 people inside a darkened movie theater July 20, 2012, at a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises, did not."It may be in an enormous letdown or a tremendous relief" to the dismissed jurors, Robinson said. "I would not want to be the husband ... or the wife of that husband. They're going to have an uncomfortable night or two."Juror 673 said she heard the Juror 872 and her husband arguing because that juror knew she wasn't supposed to discuss the case.As jurors returned from lunch, Samour told the remaining jurors not to talk to the missing jurors and not to think about why they are gone.Earlier while speaking to Samour and lawyers outside of the presence of the rest of the jury, Juror 673 said she heard juror 872 mentioning reports claiming the defense called for a mistrial, and that Prosecutor George Brauchler was caught tweeting in the courtroom. Brauchler was reprimanded last week for tweeting about the case during proceedings.Juror 673 said other jurors might have heard the same remarks, one of which happened a week ago and the other Monday. The discussion happened on a balcony outside of the jury lounge, she told Samour.The possibility that a juror heard about the motion for a mistrial is more significant than news of Brauchler's tweet, Robinson said.USA TODAYAurora shooting defendant went on 'autopilot'Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and faces the death penalty for the 12 murders and 70 injuries during the Batman movie.Losing jurors during a long trial is fairly normal, Robinson said. Usually, jurors drop out because of work, family or health concerns. That hasn't happened yet in this case although several jurors have prompted the court to delay start times or extend lunch breaks for dental appointments and stomach bugs."With 24 jurors and months and months of trial, it was inevitable something would happen," Robinson said. It took nearly three months to choose the jury after 9,000 summonses were sent.USA TODAYHolmes found 'purpose' in Aurora theater shootingTwelve members of the panel will deliberate Holmes' sentence at the end of the trial. The others will be allowed to go home.But the jurors and the public don't know who is a juror and who is an alternate. With the dismissal of three people Tuesday, nine alternates remain.Jurors are allowed to go home every night, but they can't discuss the case with anyone or see or read anything about it.USA TODAYJurors dissecting accused theater shooter's state of mindOnce Juror 673 was asked to leave the courtroom, Samour told the lawyers he was concerned that Juror 872 had violated his orders, including avoiding media reports about the case and not discussing the trial with anyone."It seems to me that the juror sitting in seat No. 9 appears to have violated one of my advisements," the judge said.Samour was most concerned that no one had told him earlier about what had happened.Contributing: Blair Shiff, KUSA-TV, Denver; The Associated Press
