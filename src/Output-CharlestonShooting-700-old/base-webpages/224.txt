 A woman survived the massacre at a historic black church in Charleston by playing dead and laying atop her granddaughter to protect her. 
 Cynthia Taylor told The Associated Press that she spoke with Felecia Sanders, who gave her the account of how she managed to survive the incident. 
 Taylor is the niece of 87-year-old shooting victim Susie Jackson, who was a longtime member of The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and sang in the choir.
