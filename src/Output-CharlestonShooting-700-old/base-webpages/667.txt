This video shows President Barack Obama leading a chorus of the hymn Amazing Grace following his 35 minute eulogy at the funeral of Charleston massacre victim Clementa Pinckney. He attended the service after flying in from the White House following America's historic supreme court decision allowing gay marriage across the country. During his address the President reiterated his intent to ensure there was crackdown on gun ownership in the States and also honoured the nine who died. He said that includes removing the Confederate flag from the State House grounds, which he said would be not an act of political correctness but a "meaningful balm" for the unhealed wounds of slavery.

 For too long we were blind to the pain the Confederate flag has stirred in many of our citizens,' the president told the audience halfway through his address. 'It's true, a flag did not cause these murders, but as people from all walks of life, Republicans and Democrats, have acknowledged, as we all have to acknowledge, the flag has always represented more than ancestral pride,' Obama said, drawing cheers and applause from members of the audience. More than half way through the five hour service, the president and first lady took seats in the first row accompanied by Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill.

Song: Obama leads mourners in singing the song "Amazing Grace"


 A sign at the front of the service read: "Wrong church. Wrong people. Wrong day." Mr Obama was the only speaker out of 25 to refer to Roof. He said the alleged killer was "blinded by hatred" but never could have imagined the remarkable forgiveness of the families of the victims, nor the "thoughtful introspection and self-examination that we so rarely see in public life." "He failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood, the power of God's grace, "He's given us the chance where we've been lost to find our best selves. We may not have earned it, this grace, with our rancour and complacency short-sightedness and fear of each other, but we got it all the same."
