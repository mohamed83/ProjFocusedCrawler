Family claims: The cousin of Dylann Roof has said that it may have been losing out to a love rival that drove him to racism











Racist Charleston church murder suspect Dylann Roof was driven to his warped, hate-filled view of the world after a love interest chose to date an African American man instead of him, a family member has claimed. The sick 21-year-old confessed to killing nine innocent African American worshippers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, last week. And according to Roof's cousin Scott, it was losing out on love that drove him to perform the horrifying killings. 


Racist: Dylann Roof is photographed holding a pistol and waving a Confederate flag


 Scott Roof told The Intercept that Dylann "kind of went over the edge when a girl he liked starting dating a black guy two years back". He added: "Dylann liked her. The black guy got her. He changed.  "I don’t know if we would be here if not."

 Since the attack, it was revealed Roof had wrote a sick, hate-filled racist manifesto before the killings, which he posted on a website along with a number of photographs of himself. In one picture the 21-year-old can be seen posing with a handgun while in another he spits on the US flag. The manifesto was posted on a website called The Last Rhodesian. Roof wrote: “I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. “I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country.

 “We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.” Dylann admitted he nearly backed out of the shooting as he was made to feel so welcome. A son of one of the victims told the LA Times that Roof attempted to commit suicide after he killed the victims, but he had run out of bullets. "He pointed the gun at his head and pulled the trigger, but it went 'click,'" because the chamber was empty, said Kevin Singleton, the son of 59-year-old Myra Thompson. “His plan was never to leave that church,” Singleton told the paper.

Singleton said he and his family were told the story by Polly Sheppard, 69, one of two adult survivors of the massacre. Roof was apprehended the day after the shooting, after he was spotted by a motorist in North Carolina, and brought back to Charleston to face nine charges of murder. Singleton, 40, a magazine publisher, said it appeared that Roof’s original intent was to kill the church's minister, Reverend Clementa Pinckney. But when the Rev. Daniel Simmons, 74, grappled with him, he shot Simmons and the others, according to Singleton.
