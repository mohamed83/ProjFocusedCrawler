        COMMENTEMAILMORECENTENNIAL, Colo. — A former classmate of the Aurora theater shooting defendant testified Wednesday that James Holmes was sometimes socially awkward and spoke in a monotone but never seemed upset or angry.Holmes was withdrawing from the University of Colorado's neuroscience doctoral program at the time of the July 20, 2012, shooting in a suburban Denver movie theater that was premiering the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises. In testimony, one of his former classmates, Chelsea Corser-Jensen, said Holmes' presentations sometimes didn't seem particularly relevant to the work they were doing, but even though he didn't seem to be paying attention, Holmes usually knew the answers to questions when called upon in class.Holmes faces the death penalty in connection with the shooting that killed 12 and injured 70 others, and has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Also testifying Wednesday were representatives of Adult Friend Finder and Match.com, where Holmes had accounts. Holmes had posted, "Will you visit me in prison" to the Adult Friend Finder dating site, according to testimony.Prosecutors argue that Holmes is a highly intelligent young man who secretly plotted his crime for months as his professional and personal life unraveled.USA TODAYAccused Aurora shooter says he had a 'broken mind'He suffers from schizophrenia and was delusional, Holmes' defense team said. His mental illness prompted him to plan and execute the shooting without understanding that what he was doing was wrong.The trial is in its fifth week of an expected four-month schedule. On Thursday jurors will watch video-recorded interviews of Holmes conducted by state mental-health examiners after his arrest.The doctor who interviewed him concluded that he suffers from mental illness but is not legally insane.
