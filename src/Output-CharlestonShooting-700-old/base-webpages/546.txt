        COMMENTEMAILMORECENTENNIAL, Colo. — A judge in the Colorado theater shooting trial dismissed a juror Monday whose brother-in-law was involved in a robbery attempt last week.The female juror's brother-in-law had stopped at an automated teller machine in Denver at around 3 a.m. Wednesday. While the man was there, a would-be robber asked him for a cigarette and shot him three times, she told the judge while the jury was out of the courtroom.Juror 901 also told the judge that her brother-in-law is in critical condition at Denver Health Medical Center.The juror brought this incident to the court's attention Thursday because members of the panel have been instructed to not visit any of the sites involved in the July 20, 2012, shooting in which 12 were killed and at least 70 were injured inside a darkened movie theater in Aurora, Colo. Denver Health is where many victims were taken after the mass shooting.USA TODAYFormer female friend testifies Holmes talked about killingJudge Carlos Samour Jr. of the 18th Judicial Circuit initially instructed her not to speak anymore with other jurors about the incident and allowed her to continue with the trial. But over the weekend, he said he reconsidered, ruling Monday that she cannot be fair and impartial on the fate of defendant James Holmes, who has acknowledged he was the gunman three years ago but whose lawyers say he was insane at the time.Juror 901 is a white woman in her 30s or 40s who is studying international security at Denver University and said on her jury form that she does not watch TV news.USA TODAYThree jurors dismissed in Colorado theater shooting trialSamour dismissed the juror and instructed her not to talk to anyone about the dismissal. When telling the remaining 20 jurors, who do not know which ones will be the 12 to decide on Holmes' fate and who are alternates, he asked them not to speculate on why Juror 901 was gone.As court returned to the case Monday, two survivors — Pierce O'Farrill and Jerome Brooks — shot during Holmes' rampage testified.All of the jurors dismissed so far on what originally was a panel of 19 women and five men are white women. The three dismissed Tuesday were in their 20s or 30s, according to information they provided the court. All the jurors are white although two are of Hispanic ancestry.Contributing: The Associated PressRelated:USA TODAY'Not morally wrong,' Aurora theater gunman saysUSA TODAYAurora shooting defendant went on 'autopilot'USA TODAYHolmes found 'purpose' in Aurora theater shooting
