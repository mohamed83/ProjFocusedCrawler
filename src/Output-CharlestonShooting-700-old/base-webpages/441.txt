A chilling Snapchat video showing Dylann Storm Roof moments before he allegedly opened fire on a group of black churchgoers in Charleston has emerged. Tywanza Sanders, 26, was the youngest of the nine people killed in Emanuel AME church on Wednesday. Moments before the shooting, Mr Sanders took a photo showing his bible study group sitting around a table covered with papers. All the participants in the group are black except one man sat at the back is white and believed to be 21-year-old Roof. Mr Sanders sent the picture to his friends with the caption: "Bible study knowledge planter".

One of his friends, Elroy Brown, tweeted the Snapchat video, writing: "It shows them in the church having the meeting... u can even see the terrorist in the corner for a short [second]." Another friend told Mashable: "I didn't notice until now that Dylann was just a few people away from Wanza. 'You can slightly see him in the right corner of the screenshot.' Roof is understood to have been invited to study with the churchgoers before turning the gun on them.

 Mr Sanders was killed alongside Sharonda Singleton, 45, DePayne Middleton, 49, Cynthia Hurd, 54, Myra Thompson, 59, Ethel Lee Lance, 70, Daniel Simmons, 76, and Susie Jackson, 87. Roof was detained and extradited to South Carolina after police arrested him 250 miles away from the church in North Carolina after 14 hours on the run.  It has emerged that Roof told his friends he wanted to kill people a week before the massacre - but no one took him seriously because of his deadpan sense of humour.  


Victim: Tywanza Sanders, 26, was the youngest of the nine people killed in Emanuel AME church


 The 21-year-old's friend Christon Scriven, who is black, said: “He flat out told us he was going to do this stuff. "He’s weird. You don’t know when to take him seriously and when not to." Roof stormed the church in Charleston, South Carolina, and ranted at his victims: “You rape our women and you’re taking over our country. And you have to go.” The killer spared one woman to “tell the world what happened” as he shot a pastor and eight members of a bible study group.
