        TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECENTENNIAL, Colo. --  A woman who dated the Aurora theater shooting defendant says she never felt he was dangerous but suggested he see a therapist after he talked about killing people.Testifying in open court, Gargi Datta said she dated James Holmes after meeting him in their University of Colorado neuroscience PhD classes. Datta testified that although Holmes sometimes made what she considered weird, awkward or inappropriate comments, she had no idea he was planning an attack on a suburban Denver movie theater.USA TODAYThree jurors dismissed in Colorado theater shooting trialHolmes faces the death penalty in connection with the 12 deaths at the theater during a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises. Holmes was arrested outside the theater minutes after the July 20, 2012, shooting. In videotaped interviews with a court-appointed psychiatrist, Holmes admitted to the attack and said he thought it would increase his worth as a person and ensure he was remembered.Prosecutors say he meticulously planned the attack, visiting the theater, amassing and then practicing with his guns and body armor in the months beforehand. Defense attorneys say he suffers from schizophrenia and should be found not guilty by reason of insanity. A court-appointed psychiatrist says Holmes is mentally ill but not insane.Thursday was the 30th day of a trial that is expected to last into August.Earlier in the week, Judge Carlos Samour dismissed from the jury pool three women who he felt had inappropriately learned about the case from the husband of one of them, who called during a trial break to comment about a tweet sent by District Attorney George Brauchler.
    The judge for the Aurora theater shooting trial in Colorado dismissed three jurors after one juror said she overheard another juror talking about information gleaned in a news report. The judge also prohibited the media from talking with any jurors.
    VPCThose dismissals dropped the pool of jurors from 24 to 21. Of those, 12 are the actual jurors and the remainder are alternates. Only Samour, prosecutors and defense attorneys know who the actual jurors are.As they have from the start, prosecutors this week intermixed testimony from experts and investigators with stories from victims. Speaking Thursday, Farrah Soudani said she was watching the start of the movie with friends when she heard what she though were fireworks going off. They weren't."For a moment the pops stopped, then I got up to leave, and then all the sudden my side was soaking wet and was warm and I knew I was hit," Soudani said. "I looked down and could see blood start to pour from my abdomen. I tried to reach for (a coworker) to get his attention, but then my intestines fell out. I had to reach down and pick up my intestines. I said 'I'm hit. I'm hit.'"In other testimony this week, a lawyer representing an ammunition company said Holmes bought 170 pounds worth of ammunition costing nearly $2,000 about two weeks before the theater attack. The mother of one of the shooting victims is suing the ammo company.And prosecutors showed jurors a photo Holmes took of himself wearing dark contacts he'd bought to wear for the shooting. The contacts make his pupils look like they fill his entire eyes, but Holmes told the court psychiatrist he didn't wear them, and that he struggled to see through the gas mask he wore as he fired at fleeing moviegoers.
