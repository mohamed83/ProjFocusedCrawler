        COMMENTEMAILMORECENTENNIAL, Colo. — In a calm, steady voice, the Aurora theater shooting defendant explained how he went on "autopilot" after strapping on body armor and tossing a tear gas grenade into a suburban Denver movie theater before opening fire with a shotgun, rifle and pistol.Prosecutors on Tuesday continued playing the 22 hours of video recorded interviews conducted with James Holmes by court-appointed psychiatrist William Reid. In the recordings made nearly two years after the July 20, 2012, shootings that left 12 dead, Holmes rarely showed any emotion or regret. Instead, he matter-of-factly explained how he faked a phone call to duck outside as the previews rolled, put a clamp on the emergency exit to hold it open, and then returned a few minutes later as The Dark Knight Rises began playing.USA TODAYHolmes found 'purpose' in Aurora theater shooting"I raised the shotgun and saw that people were getting up in the back left corner, so I like shot in that direction. I don't remember any of the other shots with the shotgun," Holmes told Reid.Holmes faces the death penalty for the 12 murders and 70 injuries that he acknowledges causing. In his conversations with Reid, he made no effort to deny or hide his actions, and instead said he'd probably do everything the same way again: "It went according to plan."“There's a strong implication, I think, that he wants to be stopped from doing something wrong.”William Reid, court-appointed psychiatristHolmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and his attorneys argue he suffers from schizophrenia. But in the interviews, Holmes comes across as cold-hearted, logical and detail oriented. He talks about the "mission" he gave himself, and said that 100 years from now he expects to be remembered for his actions. He also said that he didn't try to run anyone down while driving to the theater because that would have both been too personal and interfered with his specific plan to increase his self-worth by killing strangers. He also said that he deliberately didn't try to shoot anyone in the back, except for people who were cowering in fear on the theater floor or who were running away.Holmes also told Reid that he used headphones beneath his gas mask and helmet to play techno music and drown out the sounds of the attack.Reid concluded that Holmes is mentally ill because knew what he was doing was wrong. Testifying on the stand, Reid said Holmes' vague wish that someone had stopped him is evidence he knew what he was doing was both illegal and morally incorrect. Holmes told Reid he wished that either the FBI or his counselor had locked him up before he could act."There's a strong implication, I think, that he wants to be stopped from doing something wrong," Reid said.Prosecutors are a little more than halfway through their presentation to jurors. The trial is expected to last through the summer.
