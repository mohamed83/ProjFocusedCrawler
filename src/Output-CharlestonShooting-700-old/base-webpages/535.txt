        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECENTENNIAL, Colo. — A fifth juror was dismissed Wednesday from the Colorado theater shooting trial because she knows a witness.After initially calling for Juror 267, a middle-aged Hispanic woman, to be dismissed May 6 after she said a witness looked familiar, James Holmes' defense team brought up the matter again Tuesday.Holmes, 27, has acknowledged that he was the gunman in a July 20, 2012, attack that killed 12 people and injured 70 others during a midnight movie at a cinema in Aurora, Colo. His defense team has maintained that he was suffering a psychotic episode at the time of the crime, and he has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.Jurors in this case will have to decide whether Holmes should be sent to a mental hospital for additional treatment, to prison for a life sentence with no chance of parole or to death row.USA TODAYTheater shooter's psychiatrist found his behavior bizarreOn Wednesday, Judge Carlos Samour Jr. of the 18th Judicial Circuit agreed that Juror 267, a school attendance clerk, was not being entirely forthcoming about how well she knew witness Maria Carbonell, whose son goes to school where the juror works. He removed her from the panel, which now has 19 jurors remaining  — five white men and 15 white women, including one white woman of Hispanic ethnicity.Twelve will decide Holmes' fate and the remaining seven are alternates, but none know who will end up in the deliberation room after the months-long trial.USA TODAYJuror's relative shot; she's taken off Colo. shooting trialTwenty-four jurors initially were impaneled. Three were dismissed June 9 after one juror spoke to her husband about the case and two other female jurors overheard the conversation. A fourth juror was dismissed Monday because her brother-in-law was the victim of a shooting.Juror 267 and the other dismissed panelists are prohibited from speaking about the case while it is pending.Prosecutors said they expect to finish presenting their witnesses Friday. But Holmes' lawyers told the judge that they won't be ready to start his defense until June 25, so jurors may have a three-day break in the proceedings at the beginning of next week.USA TODAYThree jurors dismissed in Colorado theater shooting trial
