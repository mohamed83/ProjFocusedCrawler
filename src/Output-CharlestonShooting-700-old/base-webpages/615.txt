Brown’s parents declined to speak at a morning news conference announcing the pending lawsuit, but they released a statement Wednesday after the Justice Department cleared Wilson while also alleging that the Ferguson Police Department is systemically racist. [Read: Department of Justice report on the Michael Brown shooting] “While we are saddened by this decision, we are encouraged that the DOJ will hold the Ferguson Police Department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color,” Brown’s parents said Wednesday. “It is our hope that through this action, true change will come not only in Ferguson, but around the country. If that change happens, our son’s death will not have been in vain.” Attorneys for the family said that they disagree with the DOJ’s conclusion that Wilson did not commit any crime and was reasonably afraid for his life when he fatally shot Brown on Aug. 9. [Read: Justice Dept. concludes that no, Michael Brown’s hands probably were not up] The report on the shooting concluded that Brown probably attacked the officer and did not have his hands up in surrender when the shots were fired. But protesters, civil rights groups and other observers have clung to the second DOJ report, a 100-page document that contained scathing findings and concluded that the Ferguson Police Department engages in a pattern and practice that is discriminatory.
