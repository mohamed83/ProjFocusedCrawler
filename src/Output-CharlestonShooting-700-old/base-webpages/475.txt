	The FBI is searching for a white man in his 20s, who sat through an hour of service at the Mother Emanuel AME Church, before killing six women and three men, leaving behind a lone witness to spread his evil message.

  “he must be mentally ill bc he killed 9 ppl” logic is so ridiculous. mental illness doesn’t excuse someone’s actions! #CharlestonShooting— Franchesca Ramsey (@chescaleigh) June 18, 2015
 
  The #CharlestonShooting is terrorism. I say this as a scholar of white supremacy and the Klan. White people can be terrorists too.— Kelly J. Baker (@kelly_j_baker) June 18, 2015
