Dylann Roof is suspected of killing nine at a church group











The man behind the church shooting which left nine people dead tried to kill himself during the attack but failed as he ran out of ammunition, a witness has claimed. Dylann Roof shot dead nine black worshippers in a bible class at the Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Now a son of one of the victims has told the LA Times that Roof attempted to commit suicide after he killed the victims, but he had run out of bullets. "He pointed the gun at his head and pulled the trigger, but it went 'click,'" because the chamber was empty, said Kevin Singleton, the son of 59-year-old Myra Thompson. “His plan was never to leave that church,” Singleton told the paper. Singleton said he and his family were told the story by Polly Sheppard, 69, one of two adult survivors of the massacre. Roof was apprehended the day after the shooting, after he was spotted by a motorist in North Carolina, and brought back to Charleston to face nine charges of murder. Singleton, 40, a magazine publisher, said it appeared that Roof’s original intent was to kill the church's minister, Reverend Clementa Pinckney.

 But when the Rev. Daniel Simmons, 74, grappled with him, he shot Simmons and the others, according to Singleton. Earlier it was revealed Roof had wrote a sick, hate-filled racist manifesto before the killings, which he posted on a website along with a number of photographs of himself. In one picture the 21-year-old can be seen posing with a handgun while in another he spits on the US flag.

 As reported by The Telegraph, the manifesto was posted on a website called The Last Rhodesian. Roof wrote: “I have no choice. I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. “I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. “We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.” 


Ramblings: Dylann's manifesto was posted online


 Dylann admitted he nearly backed out of the shooting as he was made to feel so welcome. And, astonishingly, relatives of his victims forgave him for the killings. Roof, who already faces calls for the death penalty, sat for an hour with members of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church before opening fire and killing six women and three men. He told police: “I wanted to start a race war, but almost didn’t go through with it because everyone was so nice.”

 After the confession, Roof’s own uncle has said he would act as executioner. But as a judge asked a relative of each of those killed whether they wanted to address a bond hearing, they offered forgiveness and prayers for his soul. Roof appeared in court in Charleston via CCTV from his cell to hear the nine counts of murder he faces. Wearing a striped prison jump suit he starred vacantly, only speaking to confirm address, age and jobless status. Looking at the killer, the daughter of grandmother Ethel Lance, 70, said: “I forgive you. Lord have mercy on your soul. “I will never talk to her ever again, but I forgive you. You hurt me. You hurt a lot of people but I forgive you.”

Felicia Sanders, the mother of victim Tywanza Sanders, said: “We welcomed you in our Bible study with open arms. Every fibre in my body hurts, and I will never be the same. We enjoyed you. “Tywanza Sanders was my son. Tywanza Sanders was my hero. Tywanza was my all. May God have mercy on you.” A representative of Myra Thompson, 59, one of those killed added: “I forgive you and my family forgives you. Repent and confess and give your life to Christ and change your ways. You’ll be better off than you are now.” Roof remained impassive as each relative spoke. Judge Gosnell explained he could not set bond for the murder charges. Dylann Storm Roof in police custody, pictured below:
