        COMMENTEMAILMOREThe marquee in front of Greater Miracle Temple church has read "Call 911. This church is on fire!" since a spirited revival there more than two months ago.Jacob Henderson, Jr. never expected that to become a reality before he got several calls around 5:15 a.m. Friday morning that the St. Marks Street church had gone up in flames."We got such a large positive feedback from the sign that we kept it up for a while," said Henderson, the son of pastor Jacob Henderson, Sr. "But to see it as an opportunity where 911 had to be called because the church is on fire is an even tougher reality."Since 1968, the church of about 200 members has served the community around the South Tallahassee neighborhood, both spiritually and through food and clothing giveaways. On Friday morning it caught fire after a tree limb fell, exposing live electrical wires, fire officials say."To see it all go is like something has been taken out of you, ripped away from you," Henderson said. "That's the toughest part."The fire caused more than $700,000 in damage and is considered a total loss, said Tallahassee Fire Department spokesman Capt. Mike Bellamy.Charring can be seen near where the exposed wires detached from the building. That's where TFD and State Fire Marshal investigators are beginning their investigation.No injuries were reported in the blaze and there is a strong will to continue with the work being done by the church and its members, despite the emotional strain of losing the building."We're happy about understanding that he holds life and death and gives strength and power, and we know that we're going to rebuild and keep pushing his ministry and his presence in this community," Henderson said. (Photo: Bjorn Morton)Buy PhotoSalvaged items sit by the curb outside of Greater Miracle Temple after the church caught fire and was destroyed Friday morning. (Photo: Karl Etters/Democrat) (Photo: Bjorn Morton)Tallahassee Fire Department firefighters work to extinguish a fire at Greater Miracle Apostolic Holiness Church Friday. (Photo: Mike Bellamy/Tallahassee Fire Department)
