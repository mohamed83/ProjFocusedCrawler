Tyeesha Aiken, a mother of two young boys, was alone in a crowd of demonstrators on Wednesday morning, just outside North Charleston city hall – there as part of a rally to demand justice for Walter Scott, the 50-year-old black man fatally shot in the back by a white police officer.
The officer, 33-year-old Michael Slager, has been charged with murder. 
“Raising two boys here, I’m afraid of sending them to school, because the police are not there to protect and serve,” said Aiken, who said she had just completed a degree in criminal justice, but was now rethinking her career because she did not trust law enforcement. 
“All cops are not bad, but corruption has taken over,” she said. 
To most of the Wednesday’s crowd, the media was also culpable. Early reports of the shooting depicted a respectable police officer taking down a criminal. But the video released on Tuesday caused a dramatic shift in the narrative. 
“I don’t think the man would have been charged if that video hadn’t surfaced,” said William, a 17-year-old who did not give his full name and who spoke at the demonstration, where few chants garnered as much fervor as those against the media: “Lies! Lies! Lies!” 
For nearly two hours, people stood in front of a podium and talked about their experiences being discriminated against in North Charleston, just outside Charleston and about 100 miles from the state capital, Columbia, where a Confederate army flag flies outside the state house. 

 

Leonard Riley, a 62-year-old longshoremen, knew Scott from church and spoke to Scott’s parents after the shooting. Riley said that Scott’s mother-in-law was weeping uncontrollably at the scene of the shooting, a testament to how well Scott took care of her daughter and grandchildren. 
“He was a good guy. He was no street guy. He was no criminal,” said Riley. “That’s what you should know – he was a decent human being.” 
The video of Scott’s death emerged as police relations with minority communities come under increased scrutiny, following a wave of high-profile police killings of unarmed black men and boys. 
In cities like Cleveland and Ferguson, Missouri, investigators found local police to have strained, and sometimes discriminatory, relations with black members of the community. 
Activists in North Charleston voiced similar complaints, said Dot Scott, the president of the Charleston branch of the NAACP. The organization is still waiting for answers about the death of 19-year-old Denzel Curnell, who was shot in the head during an encounter with the Charleston police department in June 2014. 
And black men were twice as likely to be stopped by North Charleston police as white men, according to a 2010 investigation by the local Post and Courier. Police at the time defended the practice as part of a zero-tolerance strategy to reduce crime in predominantly black neighbourhoods.

The video of Walter Scott being shot dead


Scott said that this dynamic seemed to improve after then-police chief Jon Zumalt left the department in early 2013. 
Now, however, relations will likely plummet. “I think more caution and care would’ve been taken if that was an animal than the way the officer shot that guy,” said Scott. 
Scott said she was pleased that Slager was charged, but believed police discrimination needed to be addressed. “We see police officers saying they fear for their lives, but black men need to be fleeing from officers because you never know when you get these kinds of officers,” Scott said. 
Devon Sloss, Justin Lewis and Troy Smith were in the crowd on Thursday as members of Black Lives Matter, the movement that has grown up in response to the recent police shootings. Sloss and Lewis work as youth advocates for the non-profit Loving Arms and Smith is a radio personality. 
None of the three young men knew how often they had been stopped by police officers, but were confident they couldn’t count it on their hands. And they said they had all received “the talk” from their parents – the talk about being careful around police because of your race.
“I might be driving, and see police coming, and I take off my hat, because I know it’s that bad,” said Smith. 
“The dreads, the necklaces, the chains, we’ve all been stereotyped,” said Lewis.
James Randolph, the owner of Pete & Rita’s Cafe, spoke to the crowd about how he and other black business owners are targeted by police. He said that on nights when the restaurant is crowded, police will issue a handful of zoning violation tickets at $1,100 apiece.
Randolph said eight to 10 restaurants have experienced the same thing, but he and others at least have the resources to deal with this type of discrimination. 
“If they can do that to anybody, imagine what they can do to the young brothers who can’t afford to help themselves,” said Randolph. “They don’t stand a chance under this regime.”
