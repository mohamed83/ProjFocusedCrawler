Tragic: Sheriff's deputies search women's purses as they arrive for the Sunday morning church service











A heavily armed police presence guarded the emotional first service at Charleston Church since nine members were killed by a gunman.
Hundreds of the congregation were in tears while the organist played several hymns in a memorial tribute to the fallen, allegedly gunned down by 21-year-old Dylann Roof on Wednesday.
Outside, several hundred more turned up to express solidarity with the worshippers.

Saddened: Church member Mildridge Polite is helped into the church four days after a mass shooting



Police wielding weapons searched each member of the congregation upon entering the church.
Those attending the service used hand fans to try to keep cool in the sweltering heat.
The church massacre has again trained a spotlight on the country's divisive issues of race relations and gun crime.

Security measures: A man is told to leave his sign outside of the Sunday morning service



Dylann Roof was arrested on Thursday and has been charged with nine counts of murder.
Authorities say he spent an hour in an evening Bible study group at the church, nicknamed "Mother Emanuel" for its key role in US black history, before opening fire.
Outside the Emanuel AME church, bouquets, teddy bears and balloons covered the sidewalk while hundreds of people lined up to mourn, sing hymns and leave memorials.

Emotional: Parishioners sing four days after the mass shooting



Thousands of hand-written messages covered white banners at the church's entrance, reading "God Bless," and "Thank you Sen. Rev. Clementa Pinckney. You will 4ever be an inspiration," referring to the church's pastor, a state senator who was one of the victims.
The victims' names, written on white ribbons adorned with roses, bedecked one of the church's gates. Another gate held a black shirt that read: "Do you believe us now?"
Joseph Kovas, 19, was hoping to make it inside the church for Sunday's service.

Memorial: Members of the congregation gathered to sing hymns



He said: "We wanted to come to show our presence and prayers to the community. The way they have been affected is tremendous.
 
"The people have come together in Charleston and that is great testament to this city."
Federal investigators were examining a racist manifesto apparently written by Roof that surfaced on a website on Saturday.
The site featured photos and white supremacist writings, as well as an "explanation" by the author for taking some unspecified action.

Heartbreaking: Several lost not only friends but family too



"I have no choice ... I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country," it said.
The massacre was the latest in a series of mass shootings that have reignited a debate over gun control in a country where the right to own firearms is constitutionally protected.
President Barack Obama, in an interview taped on Friday, blamed the powerful gun-rights lobby group the National Rifle Association and an apathetic American public for the failure to implement new gun control measures.

Tragic: Church members embrace inside the church



After a school shooting in Connecticut in December 2012, Obama proposed more background checks for gun sales and pushed to ban more types of military-style assault weapons and limit the capacity of ammunition magazines.
But the measures failed to win passage in the US Congress.
