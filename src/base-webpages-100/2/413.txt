Typhoon Hagupit pushed through the Philippines December 6th through 8th bringing wide-spread damage to the country. Ahead of the storm one of the largest evacuations in Philippine history took place with over 600,000 people heading to evacuation shelters or inland homes ahead of the storm.
Images of what occurred during the storm are incredible showing how powerful this storm was and if not for the evacuations the death toll could have been much higher.
