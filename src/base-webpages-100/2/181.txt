What's This?

Super Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines on Nov. 7, 2013, initially making landfall in Guiuan, on Eastern Samar. The storm then made a devastating trek across the city of Tacloban the next day, where the 190 mile per hour sustained winds and towering storm surge destroying much of the city. 
The death toll from the storm is at least 6,300, with tens of thousands more displaced from their homes, in some cases permanently. The storm was one of the most powerful typhoons ever recorded, with maximum sustained winds of 195 miles per hour at its peak intensity.

Experts differ on the actual height of the storm surge, which is the wall of water that tropical cyclones, including typhoons, direct toward coastlines due to their winds, low air pressure and the shape of the seafloor. Some research suggests that a unique combination of factors caused a nearly 50-foot rise in water levels near the point of landfall â scouring hillsides of trees and rocks while destroying manmade structures in the way. 
A year later, rebuilding efforts are still underway. Below are images from the disaster after it happened and one year later.


Typhoon Haiyan One Year Anniversary

One year later, on the right, Joshua stands near a makeshift house next to a tent city in the Leyte province. He lost 23 relatives including his mother and younger sister in the super storm.

On the left, a damaged home is seen next to a ship washed ashore during Typhoon Haiyan on November 10, 2013, in the village of Anibong. 
On the right, the same ship on October 30, 2014. The still-stranded cargo ship is just one piece in a still massive recovery effort taking places in the Philippines. Over four million people were displaced when Haiyan destroyed or damaged almost everything in its path as it swept through the eastern and central Philippines in 2013.

One year after Haiyan left nearly 8,000 people dead or missing in the eastern Philippines, many survivors are still suffering from emotional distress despite being busy with physically rebuilding their lives.
