Typhoon Haiyan: A Year of Recovery






 
          Photo: Tyler Jump/IRC        


On Nov. 8, 2013, one of the strongest storms in recorded history, Typhoon Haiyan, struck the Philippines, disrupting the lives of more than 14 million people. More than 6,000 people lost their lives and 90 percent of homes in the hardest hit areas were damaged or destroyed. The International Rescue Committee deployed its emergency response team immediately after the storm subsided. Working closely with aid agencies from the Philippines, the IRC provided emergency supplies and quickly began recovery and resiliency programs. In the year since, homes have been rebuilt, people are back to work and communities are more prepared for future storms.

How We Help


The IRC distributed water storage containers and other emergency supplies immediately after Typhoon Haiyan and continued to work in the most devastated areas for months.The most vulnerable people affected by Typhoon Haiyan were given vouchers redeemable for construction materials at local stores and small cash grants to pay for labor in order to rebuild their homes.Typhoon Haiyan had a disastrous impact on the fishing economy that provides most of the food and income for families on the island of Panay in the Visayas region. The IRC and its partner, Philippine Business for Social Progress, supplied motorized boats to fishermen, installed floating and sea-floor artificial reefs and newly planted mangroves to protect the shore from erosion and serve as a breeding ground for fish.The IRC partnered with Ramon Aboitiz Foundation, Inc., to rebuild 20 daycare centers which will double as safe houses during future storms.In addition, using our “Healing Classrooms” approach, the IRC trained 21 daycare teachers. “Healing Classrooms,” designed specifically for survivors of conflict and natural disasters, helps teachers develop an environment where students feel safe, cared for and engaged.

He said: "We ... make sure that we prioritize our programs based on the voices of those that we’re there to serve and then we swing into action: starting to procure goods, deliver goods, rebuilding homes and communities.""...[the survivors] know what it’s going to take to get back on their feet and they just need a little bit of help to get there. And that’s the message we’ve heard, and that’s how we’ve tailored our programs."The IRC is helping to meet some of the most urgent needs of thousands of families, distributing clean water and jerry cans for water storage. We are also focusing on providing solar lamps (called Waka Waka lights) and emergency shelter kits made up of rope and plastic sheeting and bamboo. We're also developing livelihood programs that will help families and communities to recover and rebuild.

The island is the largest egg-producing region in all of the Philippines, and many of the chicken farms were destroyed by the storm. Crowds of people greeted us as we arrived in one of the coastal villages on Bantayan... Houses throughout the village were flattened by the storm and livelihoods have been severely disrupted. At this point any little bit that aid organizations bring is a welcome comfort.  More aid is getting to more people, but it still doesn’t seem to be enough. It’s going to take a lot more to get these communities back on track. And again, resiliency seems to be the story. According to [IRC senior environmental health coordinator] Bibi Lamond: “The priority needs have been shelter and food. People were asking for money ... to buy fishing boats and rebuild their homes... They’re in absolute dire straits, and they want to work. [But] there wasn’t one focus group or interview that we did where people didn’t find something to laugh about.” Devastation on the coast of Panay after #Haiyan #yolanda. http://t.co/F84wlQSNDpTyler Jump@theIRC and our partner in the Philippines @PBSPorg speaking with a survivor of #Haiyan #Yolanda http://t.co/3LI5y0TBOHTyler JumpIn profile, IRC's Melody Munz speaks about her work & how IRC's emergency response to #Haiyan and elsewhere is unique http://t.co/gum5YjdSiiIntl Rescue Comm IRCNov. 22, 2013 -"I’ve always sought out new experiences and been interested in how people cope with their problems," says Melody Munz, an IRC first responder in the Philippines.

We visited a badly damaged rice milling factory. They were protecting their reserves of rice with tarps from the rain as the entire roof was gone. The mill was damaged in the storm and no longer working. Even with their struggles, they were preparing and distributing rice rations in the parking lot, complete with seasoning.The needs remain: food, shelter reconstruction, and livelihoods. Everyone is telling us how badly they want to get back to work."Excellent @UNOCHA map on #TyphoonHaiyan. 4.4

Typhoon Haiyan wreaked enormous damage on Panay and the larger western Visayas region, but little aid has been getting through:This week our team has been traveling to some of the most difficult to access and underserved communities. We were often the first to visit. We traveled north along the coast in Panay, Pontevedra, Pres Roxas, Pilar and Carles municipalities. Other IRC teams visited more municipalities along the east coast of the island. The amount of damage [to homes and businesses] is very high. Numbers are still above 90% affected. From our own assessments, we regularly saw upwards of 50% destroyed plus 40% damaged in many locations. We met a man in Panay whose home was completely destroyed. His family of 8 is sharing a much smaller makeshift shelter set up directly behind where his house once stood. They’ve stopped working completely to focus on rebuilding their home, which they’d started doing already, and are relying completely on goods that are coming in. When asked what they needed most they replied, “anything that can help us go back to our normal lives.” Many of the families we met said similar things. The focus really seems to be on getting things rebuilt and getting back to normalcy. In another community on the coast, a woman told us they’d lost a number of boats in the storm which left fishermen without any means of income. The lack of boats also affected the women who work on the shore helping the fishermen bring their catch in, the women in the market who sell the fish, and of course the end consumers. No boats not only meant no fish, it meant no income in the normal production chain. The woman said, “we need to get our livelihoods back so we can buy food.”  This was a common theme in our conversations. People asking for help getting back to work. Issues facing Philippines don't end after disaster response finishes. 4million homeless. Health services, food, water, livelihoods needed.Sanj SrikanthanFocus on areas where little aid is getting through Nov. 19. 2013 -Today's update from IRC director of emergency preparedness and response, Bob Kitchen:"What is clear from everything we are seeing on the ground is that access to uncontaminated water is a top priority. Safe drinking water difficult to come by. Using water filtration systems, the IRC is focused on getting clean water to people in some of the most isolated areas in the western Visayas region – provinces like Aklan and Antique where some 600,000 people have been displaced but very little aid is getting through."

On the way, the damage became progressively more severe. While the main road had essentially been cleared, power lines still crisscrossed often (we even saw children playing on the downed lines a few times), tin roofs were peeled back from their structures and trees had collapsed everywhere, often splitting homes and other buildings in two.Many schools and markets along the main road seemed to be open and functioning, but we also heard reports of schools still closed as a result of damage and people living in them.  In Roxas we heard from local officials that the provincial government response funds have nearly been exhausted. They’re relying heavily on outside organizations to continue to provide relief. The needs remain: food, medicine, water, shelter and most importantly the restoration of electricity, water supply systems and communications. Even less attention has been given to communities inland, where we’ve heard reports of damage equally as bad, and where access is potentially even more difficult. Some of these areas are only accessible by foot and can take hours to hike to.

Read more about our emergency response team:International Rescue Committee Emergency ResponseWhen conflict erupts or natural disaster strikes, the International Rescue Committee delivers rapid, lifesaving aid.On the ground Nov 12, 2013 - Here's the very latest on the situation on the ground and the IRC's Typhoon Haiyan relief efforts from Bob Kitchen, who heads up the IRC's emergency preparedness and response unit:- IRC emergency teams that include experts in water, sanitation and health, hope to reach some of the hardest hit areas, including Tacloban and Cebu, by Friday. An IRC emergency protection expert will join them later this week to help set up programs to assist vulnerable women and children. Also, a cash for work program will be put in place as soon as is feasible to help provide storm survivors with a source of income.- The main destruction appears to have been concentrated in Tacloban, though six regions of the country have been affected. There is concern that because many communities in the archipelago have been cut off, officials do not yet know the scale or impact of the typhoon in more outlying areas.- Since November 8, many Tacloban residents have spent recent nights without shelter, sleeping under trees or the ruins of buildings badly damaged by Haiyan. - The storm also destroyed basic water and sanitation infrastructure, which has contributed to a growing public health risk.
