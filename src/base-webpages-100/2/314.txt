NAVAL, Biliran, December 12 (PIA) – Partial report of the Biliran Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) chaired by Governor Gerardo J. Espina, Jr. indicated that the province of Biliran suffered damages to infrastructures, agriculture, partially and totally damaged houses and power and electricity amounting to P72,504,638.49.

According to the  report of the Biliran PDRRMC which was submitted  to the Office of the Civil Defense (OCD), assessment of damages brought by typhoon Ruby is progressing as the eight municipalities of Biliran province are also continuing assessment in their respective areas.
The report further said that in the eight municipalities of Biliran province, there were 4,406 partially damaged houses while the totally damaged houses numbered to 413.
Only one casualty was reported as a result of typhoon Ruby.  The victim, a 60-year old man and a resident of Brgy. Bool Central in the municipality of Culaba identified as Ridmoro Baylon.
The report revealed that the P72,504,632.49 amount of initial damage was broken down as follows:  partially and totally damaged houses amounted to P37,037,000;  roads – P23,200,000;  power and electricity – P2,696,338.49;  damage to agriculture on crops – P7,962,800;  fisheries- P581,000, and livestock – P140,000.

December 6, 2014, 3 0’clock in the afternoon, Signal no. 2 is raised all over Biliran, moderate blew of wind already felt as people from different walks of life turned willingly themselves in the evacuation area or anywhere safe for them.
According to Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council Disaster Monitoring Report as of December 6, 2014, 2:00 PM, 40,086 number of evacuees are confirmed listed on 153 evacuation center. People from all side of the island braced of the forecast devastating Typhoon Ruby, which at that time already raised from 195 kph to 215 kph. traveling North-Northwest and is expected to landfall in Dolores, Eastern Samar later that night.
Mixed caution and fear accumulated in the nerves of our fellow Biliranon’s as the communication signals collapse approximately 5 pm. together with the shutdown of power supply done to prevent any hazards; fear of what might happen and advisories from PAG-ASA and Project NOAH on storm surges that may raise up to 4 meters.
As the town turned empty and seemingly ghost towns, gradually the wind blew harshly, and the rain poured endlessly. As the wind and water heightened, the worries of Biliranon’s deepened that night. It was indeed one of the longest and most fearful night of our lives. From time to time, we could only hear the iron roofs cries as Typhoon Ruby ransacked and rape them above. Faith in God, is the only weapon and prayer is the only doing that could pacify the fear in ourselves. It was one hell of a night.
What makes things worse is early December 7 morning, expectation that the typhoon might already end seemed like impossible for the consistency of the strong blew of wind and intense pouring of rain is still there, non-stop. The agony lingered all throughout the day. Thankfully, the typhoon, gradually ceased hours later that Sunday evening.
The next day, Typhoon Ruby’s devastating powers evidently casted upon numerous barangays especially those areas located along coast of Naval. Some of those barangays are Catmon, Sto. Nino, Agpangi, Atipolo and Caray-caray (Ilawud/Banderahan).
Aside from the trauma, wrecked seawalls, ruined houses, missing roofs and thick mud deposits are some of the problems brought by Ruby. Landslide in Looc, Cabucgayan, Inasuyan, Kawayan, and Sitio Pulang Yuta, Caibiran are just some of the lanslides counted in relation to the Typhoon Ruby’s aftermath.
Barangay Marvel in Culaba is reported to have received so much destruction from the typhoon.
December 8, 2014, evacuees already went back to their own homes but with the doubt whether they still have houses or none. Those that the houses are gone, still resides on the evacuation sites until this hour.
