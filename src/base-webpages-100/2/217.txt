Disaster Response Networks (DRN’s) coordinated and led by PBCI relief operations trainer Kriz Cruzado have been traveling around Eastern Samar distributing aid since December 19th.

22.December.2014



The local volunteers belonging to the newly-trained and newly-organized Disaster Response Networks (DRNs) have finally managed to deliver relief goods to 278 families in hard-to-reach Barangay Siha, in the Municipality of Borongan, Eastern Samar.

				by PeaceBuilders Community, Inc. 
17.December.2014



Nanay Lita lives in Barangay Siha, Municipality of Borongan, Eastern Samar. As Typhoon Ruby was raging, and her home was beginning to flood, she placed her 2-month-old baby inside a washing machine, hoping the washer would serve as a makeshift boat. Thankfully, she and her baby survived. But their house and coconut/rice farm (their main source of livelihood) was in a …

09.December.2014



Typhoon Hagupit has all but left the country into the South China Sea, as of Tuesday, December 9th. The storm hit Manila, but by that time had slowed to winds of less than 100 Km/h and rains had receded from their torrential caliber. Downgraded again from a tropical storm to a tropical “depression”, the destruction …
