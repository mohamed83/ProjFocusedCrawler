						PAGASA Website Breaks Down As Hagupit/Ruby Threatens PHL

The website of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) is one of the most vital websites to visit during threats of bad weather.
However, the just broke down this morning.
Probably, it may have succumbed to the overwhelming number of visitors wanting to access the site.
The website, powered by Joomla!, received an SQL connection error this morning prior to its complete breakdown.
This error occasionally happened even before during the time of high demand, especially during the time of bad weather.
Typhoon Ruby, internationally named as Hagupit, is threatening the Philippines. Forecast tracks are confusing, and widely varied, with potential impact stretching from Northern Luzon to northern Mindanao.
Currently, PAGASA can be accessed through its Facebook and Twitter pages. An alternative site, in kidlat.pagasa.dost.gov.ph, is also available, but it is still unknown how long can this last.
