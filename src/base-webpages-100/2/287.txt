Investors question forecasts from ExxonMobil and other oil companies









As climate talks wind down in Lima, investors are pressuring fossil fuel companies to account for climate change in business strategies. Yet many still forge ahead as if little has changed

A powerful storm of market forces is rippling across the fossil fuel industry: plummeting oil prices, weakening global oil demand, growing momentum for carbon-reducing regulations, and the rapid growth of renewable energy. In just the past few days, oil prices hit a five-year low of $61 a barrel and the Bank of England launched a review of the industry’s stability, including the potential harmful impacts of stranded fossil fuel assets on the economy.
And all this is happening against the backdrop of international climate negotiations. As country representatives gather in Lima to build momentum towards an international climate deal next year in Paris, investors around the world are stepping up scrutiny of the fossil fuel industry. 
From shareholder resolutions that have already been filed with seven companies as part of the 2015 proxy season in the US – including ExxonMobil, Hess and Marathon Oil – to filings this month with BP and Shell backed by 100 European investors, they’re pressing the companies they own to address the escalating financial risks that are becoming more apparent with each passing day. Investors are especially concerned about potentially wasteful spending to develop new fossil fuel reserves that would be unprofitable at today’s oil prices.
More than $200bn of the riskiest projects have already been canceled or delayed due to these market shifts – most of them oil sands projects in Canada and offshore projects in the deepest waters in places like west Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. Today’s crude oil prices are nearly $40 a barrel lower than the prices these projects will need to break even, according to Goldman Sachs. And this week, Bank of America warned that crude prices will drop to $50 a barrel over the coming months.
Yet despite all this, many of the industry’s biggest players are still forging ahead as if little has changed.
Just this week, ExxonMobil issued its annual energy outlook projecting 35% growth in global energy demand – with oil being the dominant fuel – by 2040, a “business-as-usual” perspective that stands in striking disregard of global trends affecting the sector. Exxon’s chief strategist went so far as to suggest that renewables “are just not ready for primetime” – a statement at odds with the fact that wind, solar and other green power sources are growing at a record clip and already produce 22% of the world’s electricity, according to the International Energy Agency.
At in-person meetings with board members and top management, investors are questioning the accuracy of these companies’ oil and gas demand forecasts. They are encouraging companies to spend less on costly, high carbon-intensive projects, which the IEA says will likely not be viable as the world reduces its reliance on fossil fuels and transitions to a low-carbon future. 
They are also calling on companies to disclose how high the price of oil needs to be for their highest-cost projects to break even, and to revaluate the types of projects they’re financing as fossil fuel demand declines. After all, countries such as the US and China, which agreed last month to significantly reduce carbon emissions over the next decade, expect to use less, not more, fossil fuels in the future.
Investors who are engaging with oil and gas companies in the coming months will be armed with a new set of expectations, which outlines key questions that senior oil and gas executives and board members should be considering as they navigate today’s fast-changing energy landscape. The Investor Expectations: Oil and Gas Company Strategy was published this week by Ceres’ Investor Network on Climate, the European Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, the Investors Group on Climate Change in Australia and New Zealand, and the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change.
Investors want stronger climate policies
Further complicating the fossil fuel industry’s future is growing appetite – from the US, China and the European Union – to sign an international climate agreement next year in Paris.
Investors have already made it clear they want stronger climate policies. At the UN Climate Summit in September, for example, more than 350 investors representing over $24tn in assets called for an ambitious international agreement, including meaningful carbon pricing and an end to fossil fuel subsidies. 
The resolutions and upcoming engagements build on the Carbon Asset Risk Initiative, an effort – launched last year by Ceres, Carbon Tracker and 75 investors – aimed at 45 of the world’s largest fossil fuel companies. Most of the companies have responded to a detailed letter that investors sent to the companies a year ago, including BHP Billiton, Eni, ExxonMobil, Shell, Southern Company, Statoil and Vale.
As the disclosures reveal, most companies recognize that climate change poses real risks that warrant action. Several companies even acknowledged the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s conclusions that the world is on a path to 4C-5C degrees of warming, a scenario that scientists and groups like the World Bank say would be catastrophic to the environment and the global economy. 
In their written responses, however, most of the companies continue to rely on “business-as-usual” assumptions. These support aggressive capital spending and rising global oil demand until at least 2030 while dismissing the idea of a faster transition towards a low-carbon economy that an increasing number of businesses, investors, citizens and governments demand.
As unlikely as the fossil fuel majors think low-carbon scenarios might be, the shifting and increasingly unfavorable dynamics facing the industry are not going away anytime soon. Investors are increasingly asking the tough questions about how to reconcile the changing dynamics of the industry – plummeting oil prices, weakening global oil demand, growing momentum for carbon-reducing regulations and the rapid growth of renewable energy – with their own biased fossil fuel forecasts.
If the growing momentum in the investor community is any indication, it won’t be long before we start getting the answers we need.
