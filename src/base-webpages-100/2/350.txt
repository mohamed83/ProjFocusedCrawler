Typhoon Haiyan: One Year On

This time last year, as we were preparing for the EMA 2013, the news came through that a devastating Typhoon had hit Southeast Asia. In amongst all the music at the EMA, Jared Leto led the audience as we thought about our friends around the world and the huge struggle they were  facing.
MTV Voices has been working on a one-off show to celebrate the young people who lived through the storm, as well as find out what it takes when you’re pushed into a life and death situation. You & Me Vs The World will be on MTV in December, but on the anniversary of Typhoon Haiyan we wanted to share some of the pictures that we shot – and how the Philippines looks one year on.
Thanks to International Medical Corps and the European Commission for their help in the Philippines as part of their First Responders campaign, which proves how ordinary people can do the most extraordinary things in an effort to help each other in times of crisis.
