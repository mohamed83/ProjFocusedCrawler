Hagupit Poses 'Great Danger' to Rebuilding Progress in Haiyan-Battered Areas of Philippines

Hagupit made landfall as a powerful typhoon in the Philippines late Saturday night local time in the Province of Eastern Samar, bringing sustained winds over 185 kph (115 mph) with gusts around 233 kph (145 mph.)
Major threats from Hagupit, named Ruby in the Philippines, include widespread flooding, strong winds and mudslides.
Hagupit will continue to slowly traverse the Philippines through Monday bringing damaging winds and torrential rainfall. AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Eric Leister writes. "Due to this slow movement, areas will experience this extreme weather for a long duration, further increasing the damage and impacts of the storm."

The storm's landfall comes a little little over a year since Super Typhoon Haiyan brought devastation to the country and within 100 miles of where Haiyan first made landfall. More than 7,300 deaths are attributed to Haiyan with damages totaling 581.1 billion pesos ($12.9 billion) according to The Associated Press.
Recovery efforts from Haiyan are still ongoing, and there is concern that Hagupit's impacts could threaten to undo the rebuilding progress.
"Since Haiyan hit last year, many areas have been rebuilt, yet many are still under construction," said Nicole Harris, media relations manager for CARE, a humanitarian organization that works to fight global poverty and assist with natural disaster recovery. "There is a great danger that some of the progress of reconstruction will be diminished."

The AP reported that 650,000 residents were evacuated as the storm bore down on the country.
"I'm scared," Haiyan survivor Jojo Moro told The AP. "I'm praying to God not to let another disaster strike us again. We haven't recovered from the first."
Following Haiyan, residents were more prepared to evacuate, according to Winnie Aguilar, a communications officer with CARE Philippines.
"The memories of Haiyan are still fresh, and while such memories somehow revive their trauma, such also encourage and inspire them to be better prepared and become safer," Aguilar said.
The most vulnerable populations have been evacuated to government-assigned evacuation centers with the hope being that people will generally be safer there according to Aguilar. Multiple government units and national agencies worked together to prepare for the storm and evacuation. In critical areas, relief goods were pre-positioned, Aguilar said.
"The government is generally giving assurances that plans and contingencies are in place for worst case scenarios in any event," she said.
After the catastrophic nature of Haiyan, many residents were frightened about the arrival of Hagupit, Harris said. Many were looking to leave, with long lines of people waiting to get on boats to the neighboring island of Cebu, she added.

In Haiyan-affected areas CARE is working in, new shelters have been built with improved construction techniques made to make the buildings stronger and sturdier and are expected to better withstand typhoons.
However, Aguilar said many families outside of CARE's coverage area are still living in makeshift homes made of light materials and are using tarpaulins for walls and temporary walls.
"If they stay in their current locations, it would be difficult for them to withstand the threat of Hagupit but again, we hope the evacuations will cover all vulnerable areas to avoid any catastrophic impacts of Hagupit," she said.
