Location of eye/center: At 10:00 PM today, the eye of Typhoon “Neneng” was located based on all available data at 1,260 km East Northeast of Itbayat, Batanes (24.5°N, 133.5°E).
Strength: Maximum sustained winds of 175 kph near the center and gustiness of up to 210 kph
Movement: Forecast to move Northwest at 20 kph.
Forecast Positions: Typhoon “Neneng” is expected to be outside the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) by tomorrow early morning and at 1,540 km Northeast of Itbayat, Batanes in the evening.
• Estimated rainfall amount is from 7.5 – 30 mm per hour (heavy – intense) within the 700 km diameter of the typhoon.
• NENENG is still too far to affect any part of the country. However, it is expected to enhance the northeasterly winds which will result to rough to very rough sea conditions over the northern and eastern seaboard of Northern Luzon this weekend. Fisherfolks and those with small seacrafts are advised not to venture out over the said seaboards.
• The public and the disaster risk reduction and management council concerned are advised to take appropriate actions and watch for the next bulletin to be issued at 11 AM tomorrow or earlier.
