            Typhoon Hagupit taking aim at the Philippines – EU stands ready to assist          















Photo credit: EU/ECHO05/12/2014 Only 13 months after the deadly Typhoon Haiyan made its landfall in the Philippines, the nation is being threatened by another ferocious storm with heavy rainfall and shattering winds. Though the impact of Typhoon Hagupit, which is currently taking its aim at the archipelago nation, will only be known after the landfall foreseen for the end of this week, the Filipino people and their needs are a priority regardless of the storm's impact.Immense efforts have been invested in disaster preparedness work in the country in the past year, and the population is more aware of the need for a timely evacuation from coastal areas. The Philippine authorities have taken swift measures in relocating people from the exposed areas at the first signs of the storm approaching.The European Commission is dispatching a team of humanitarian experts to support the government and help assess potential needs for assistance. The Commission's Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) in Brussels is closely monitoring the situation and is liaising with humanitarian organisations on the ground to ensure a coordinated approach in case the needs emerge.The EU supported the emergency response and recovery efforts in the aftermath of last year's super-typhoon Haiyan and remains committed to assisting the affected communities and addressing their needs.BackgroundTyphoon Hagupit is forecast to make landfall between Eastern and Northern Samar island on 6 December in the evening. According to the latest estimates, about 4.5 million people could be affected across the central and northern Philippines.Around 20 typhoons hit the Philippines every year, many of them destructive. The deadliest one on record was Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda), which crossed the archipelago in early November 2013 and caused massive devastation, leaving over 6 000 dead and 4 million displaced. Some of the survivors have not recovered yet from this disaster, or have just rebuilt their lives.Following Typhoon Haiyan last year, the European Commission immediately deployed humanitarian and civil protection experts to the worst hit areas. It also made available €40 million in relief assistance and early recovery and reconstruction to help the most affected communities.
