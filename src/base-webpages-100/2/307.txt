The global people's climate march is a reason to be a climate optimist









The people's climate march is a reason to be a climate optimist, despite the grave dangers posed by runaway global warming.

We are almost out of time to build a zero carbon future, and the devastating impacts of global warming will only become worse if our leaders do nothing. Tens of thousands of people in Australia and many thousands more around the world marched today to send this message to delegates in New York for the United Nations climate summit.

Over 20,000 people marched in Melbourne, listening to politicians like Labor's Mark Butler and the Greens party's Christine Milne call for climate action.

This global event is an amazing confluence of international civic action, a full twenty-four hours of people power calling for the de-carbonisation of our world. The fact that it can happen at all is a reason to be a climate optimist.
The science of global warming is unequivocal. The physical evidence is in: the temperature is rising to dangerous levels far faster than most worst case scenarios. Current trends will lead us to 4°C of global warming or worse by the end of the century. If we exceed 2°C then it is likely the warming will be irreversible and enormously dangerous.
Climate related catastrophes are already increasingly commonplace. Cyclones, fires, floods, droughts, melting glaciers and unseasonal weather are more commonplace than ever before. As they become more common and more severe, communities and societies will be impacted; lives and jobs will be displaced.
A new, zero carbon future is possible.
The New Climate Economy report released last week shows that lasting economic growth is possible through deep structural reform that transforms the global economy into a low-carbon, climate resilient one. Developing countries will be at the heart of these changes, but rich nations like Australia must do their fair share through carbon reduction policies and through investing in new, clean renewable energy technology.
At the Melbourne climate march, many of the signs called for the Abbott government to retain the renewable energy target. The target is one of the few remaining structural policy reforms to assist with reducing Australia's carbon emissions.

The renewable energy target rates as one of the most effective bi-partisan policies of the last decade. It is also enormously popular, with polling by the Liberal-party aligned firm Crosby Textor showing that more than 80 percent of Australians support the target, and as many as 70 percent of Liberal voters want the target unchanged. While the policy was once bi-partisan, it is no longer, with senior Liberal government figures calling for it to be frozen, wound back or abolished.
It is essential that policies such as the renewable energy target remain. It is also important that the disastrous decision made by the Abbott government to repeal the carbon pricing legislation be reversed as soon as possible.
Carbon prices, shadow prices and emissions reduction measures are now a reality in over forty nations, with twenty regions now having some form of carbon pricing. Structural reform is essential to reign in carbon pollution and cut emissions.
In the USA, the climate march is backed by an "unprecedented coalition of 45 major labor groups, including heavy hitters such as the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) — a group that Henn said "doesn't mess around" — along with prominent grassroots environmental organizations like 350.org as well as religious organizations".
It is heartening that increasingly environment groups are joining forces with other civil society groups like unions, faith groups and development agencies. Internationally, unions are building a global campaign under the banner "no jobs on a dead planet".
These alliances and campaigns in civil society, as well as ones in the business world, are the start of a positive civil society "tipping point", guided by the optimistic hope that we can still act to stop global warming.
As I publish this article, the climate marches continue, a colourful, vibrant call for actions not words, to stop the greatest threat to our future. We can no longer continue with business as usual. We can't rely on politicians doing the right thing in New York; each and every one of us can take action now.
