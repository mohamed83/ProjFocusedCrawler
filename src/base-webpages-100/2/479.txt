Vhong Navarro’s attackers, Deniece Cornejo and Cedric Lee plans to leave Philippines according to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).
NBI revealed that the assailants of Vhong Navarro had booked a flight to Singapore via PAL flight PR 503 with the flight schedule on February 6, 2014 at 7:55 in the morning.

Data were taken from the integrated information and booking system of Philippine Airlines (PAL). Deniece Cornejo and Cedric Lee reserved a flight schedule for Singapore thru Internet two days ago.
Though there was a booking has been initiated online but they did not pay for the plane tickets yet.







Flight reservation can be only confirmed if the person who made the reservation, paid and was issued with electronic ticket of the said flight.
NBI Director Virgilio Mendez and Justice Secretary Leile de Lima give assurance that they will take care this matter.
According to the Bureau of Immigration the alleged mastermind of Vhong Navarro’s case, Cedric Lee and Deniece Cornejo are allowed to leave the country as of this time, since they are not yet included in the immigration watch list and no Hold Departure Order (HDO) has been issued against them.
They can be only not allowed to leave Philippines, if the Department of Justice issued an order with the signatory of Secretary Leila de Lima.
The question is why Cedric Lee and Deniece Cornejo attempt to leave the country? What do you think?
