From Hurricane to Typhoon: What Happens When Tropical Cyclones Cross the International Date Line?

One of the more common questions we get here at The Weather Channel and weather.com is this one:"What is the difference between a hurricane and a typhoon?"The answer is simple: a tropical cyclone is called a "hurricane," a "typhoon" or a "cyclone" depending on the ocean basin in which it forms.

Tropical cyclones that form in the Atlantic Basin and achieve 74 mph sustained wind speeds or higher are called hurricanes, and they are monitored by the National Hurricane Center.In the Eastern Pacific Basin, which spans from the west coast of North America to 140°W longitude, tropical cyclones are also called hurricanes, and they are monitored by the National Hurricane Center.

In the Central Pacific Basin, which spans from 140°W longitude to 180°W longitude, tropical cyclones are also called hurricanes, and they are monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center.

In the Western Pacific Basin, which spans west of the 180°W longitude line to Asia, including the South China Sea, tropical cyclones that exhibit sustained wind speeds of 39 mph are called tropical storms, just like in the Atlantic and in the eastern Pacific.

However, when sustained wind speeds reach 74 mph, the cyclone is not called a hurricane but rather a typhoon,and they are monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center as well as the Japan Meteorological Agency. When wind speeds reach 150 mph or greater, the system is called a "super typhoon," the equivalent of a strong Category 4 or Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale.But what happens when a hurricane forms in one basin, like the Eastern Pacific or the Central Pacific, and moves into a different basin, like the Western Pacific? At that point, the tropical cyclone would adopt the moniker appropriate for the respective basin.For example, 2014's Hurricane Genevieve formed as a tropical storm in the eastern Pacific Basin and strengthened to a hurricane in the Central Pacific basin as it continued its journey west. However, as soon as it crossed the International Date Line (180° W Longitude), it became Typhoon Genevieve. It continued to strengthen and became Super Typhoon Genevieve.Another particular hurricane/typhoon that has done this particular "transformation" in recent history is Hurricane Ioke, which later went on to become Super Typhoon Ioke.MORE ON WEATHER.COM: Hawaii Hurricanes
