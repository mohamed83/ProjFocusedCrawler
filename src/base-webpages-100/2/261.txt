Help save lives during hunger emergencies.
Right now, families in West Africa, Syria, South Sudan, Iraq and Central African Republic are relying on us for food. But WFP’s resources are stretched thin.
Be a lifeline and help us reach one more family with lifesaving food assistance. Just $75 can feed a family in crisis for an entire month.
