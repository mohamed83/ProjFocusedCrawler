Information Map (Project ARGOS) Project Agos is a platform that combines top down government action and bottom up civic engagement to help communities deal with climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. It harnesses technology to maximize the flow of critical data before, during, and after a disaster. We want to help information reach those who need it the most: the people.
