‪#‎Hagupit‬ ‪#‎RubyPH‬ People living in coastal areas are advised to evacuate in a safe higher ground as the sea level at 10:41 pm on Dec. 6, 2014 will reach 1.77 meters based on calendar data. Pagasa notified the public of possible occurrence of 3 to 4 meters storm surge in areas where Ruby is expected to pass.

This list is an enhanced version of PAGASA’s general advisory for storm surges and is issued more than a day ahead of the Ruby’s landfall to serve as a guideline for steady and organized evacuation of communities, residents and families living in the affected areas. Do not evacuate during the typhoon as flying debris caused by strong winds can cause fatal casualties and loss.
