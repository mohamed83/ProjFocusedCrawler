Top 2 expensive disasters of 2014 - Jammu and Kashmir floods and Cyclone Hudhud  




Top 2 expensive disasters of 2014 - Jammu and Kashmir floods and Cyclone Hudhud

January 15, 2015

 
The world as a whole witnessed a relatively less eventful year in terms of natural disasters in 2014. The combined economic losses added up to 132 billion US dollars, which is 37% below the 211 billion dollar per year average damages from the previous ten years, according to the Annual Global Climate and Catastrophe Report.
Jammu & Kashmir Floods
However, India remained on top of the list of worst natural disasters on 2014. The Jammu & Kashmir floods have been ranked as the worst ever natural disaster that occurred in India since historic times. The disaster of September 2014 caused an unparalleled devastation in almost all the districts of the state. The beautiful Kashmir valley suffered colossal damage to public and private property, businesses, farm sector, tourism and numerous other segments.
The 16 billion dollar damage done in India's Jammu and Kashmir region also surpassed the damage done in the July 1993 monsoon floods.

 
 
Cyclone Hudhud
Cyclone Hudhud made landfall near Visakhapatnam on October 12. After battering coastal Andhra Pradesh and Odisha on October 13 kept, it kept losing steam as it travelled across Chhattisgarh, Bihar and east Uttar Pradesh. Torrential unseasonal rain and squally winds caused immense damage to standing crops, which were almost ready for harvesting.
Remnants of the cyclone fizzled out in Nepal and foothills of Bihar. The cyclone lost its defining features but had enough potential to bring deluge across the Annapurna Mountain range in central Nepal.
