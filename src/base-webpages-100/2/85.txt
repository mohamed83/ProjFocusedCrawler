Philippines: MSF teams are preparing for typhoon Hagupit

ShareShare this











5 December 2014On Saturday 6 December, the Hagupit typhoon is expected to hit the Visayas region, east of the Philippines. Onsite, MSF reinforces its teams and a dozen volunteers prepares to take in charge the possible wounded.
The Hagupit typhoon - that should go along with strong winds, heavy rains, landslides and giant waves - should reach the coasts and the Palo and Tacloban towns on next Saturday, during the day.
MSF is already working on the field where the organization normally runs a mother and child health project in the Palo hospital, Leyte province. Our teams are now preparing to take in charge patients who might flow after the typhoon's passage and also ensure the medical equipment's protection. The hospital will remain open and surgery would be performed.
In addition, a surgical team coming from Japan was sent there and two helicopters are on standby. Mobile clinics could be set up for surgical activities, maternal and child health and for emergencies. If necessary, additional staff will be mobilized to strengthen teams.

In 2013, MSF had provided medical care to the Filipino population after Haiyan typhoon passage.
