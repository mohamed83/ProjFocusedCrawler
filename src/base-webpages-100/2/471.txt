Justin Bieber Arrives Via Private Plane in Philippines to Help Victims of Typhoon Yolanda

 December 10, 2013










The pop superstar Justin Bieber has arrived in the Philippines on Tuesday morning, December 10, 2013 for his efforts to help the victims of super typhoon Yolanda (International Name: Haiyan) which devastated Eastern Visayas last month.

According to ABS-CBN, Bieber arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal II via a private plane at around 7:10 a.m. today.







Bieber promoted his “GiveBackPhilippines” campaign on Twitter before he visited the country. He is aiming to raise $1 million for the victims of typhoon Yolanda.
In exchange of the donations, those who donated will have the chance to hang out with him next year as he records his new songs.
“Hey guys – it’s Justin, In the wake of Typhoon Haiyan, its victims in the Philippines need our help — and they need it now. That’s why I’ve decided to partner with Prizeo to raise vital funds for the relief effort.
“I’m doing something I’ve never done before: for just a tiny donation to the relief effort, you’ll be automatically entered for a chance to hang out with me in the studio early next year and watch me record some new music. I’ll fly you and a friend over to join me in LA from wherever you are in the world. It’s gonna be awesome. Not only that, but at different donation levels you’ll receive guaranteed rewards, as well as more chances to win the grand prize. This is something I’ve never done before, and I’m so excited to hang out with one of my Beliebers,” Bieber added.
