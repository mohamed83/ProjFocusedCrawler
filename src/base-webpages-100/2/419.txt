Storm Cuts Short Pope's Trip to Typhoon-Hit Philippine City


TACLOBAN, Philippines  Jan 16, 2015, 11:49 PM ET
By JIM GOMEZ and NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press 

























Pope Francis cut short his visit to a typhoon-hit region of the Philippines on Saturday because of an approaching storm.

In brief, unscripted comments, Francis took the microphone soon after arriving at the main cathedral in Leyte province and told a surprised crowd that he would have to leave at 1 p.m., four hours ahead of schedule.

"I apologize to all of you," he said, speaking in Italian through a translator. "I am sad about this, truly saddened, because I had something prepared especially for you."

Some of the priests, nuns and others in the cathedral groaned, though mostly in a good-humored way.

After a quick exchange of gifts, in which Francis received a wood image of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception made from the debris from the typhoon-damaged church, his motorcade sped to the airport in Tacloban.

Francis traveled to the far eastern Philippines to comfort survivors of the devastating 2013 typhoon, himself braving rains and heavy winds from an approaching storm and conceding that it was hard to find the right words when surrounded by so much pain.

Tropical Storm Mekkhala, packing winds of 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour, suspended ferry services to Leyte and stranded thousands of travelers including some who wanted to see the pope. With the winds strong enough to blow away thatched roofs common in the regions, it is forecast to slam ashore on nearby Samar Island later Saturday.

"So many of you have lost everything," Francis told 150,000 Catholic faithful gathered before Mass under a steady rain in an open field near the airport in Tacloban, the city hit hardest by Typhoon Haiyan. "I don't know what to say to you, but the Lord does know what to say to you. Some of you lost part of your families. All I can do is keep silent. And I walk with you all with my silent heart."

Many in the crowd wept as Francis spoke, overcome by the memory of the Nov. 8, 2013, storm that leveled entire villages with ferocious winds and 7-meter (21-foot) waves and left more than 7,300 people dead or missing. Francis joined them in solidarity, even donning the same yellow rain poncho over his vestments that Mass-goers were given to protect them from the storm.

He drew applause when he told them that he had decided to visit the city of 200,000 in the eastern Leyte province in the days immediately after the storm.

"I wanted to come to be with you. It's a bit late, I have to say, but I am here."

Francis spoke in his native Spanish — which he reverts to when he wants to speak from the heart. He ditched his prepared homily and instead composed a brief prayer off the cuff that began: "Thank you, Lord, for sharing our pain. Thank you, Lord, for giving us hope..."

As he spoke, the winds whipped the altar cloth and threatened to topple over the candlesticks.

A police official estimated the crowd at 150,000 before the pope's arrival and said tens of thousands more were lined up outside the airport area. Wearing plastic raincoats, the festive crowd in the city clapped in unison to blaring music welcoming the pope, cheering when his plane landed after the hour-long flight from Manila.

The pope blew kisses, waved and flashed the thumbs up sign to the crowd while riding on a covered popemobile from the airport terminal to the nearby altar.
