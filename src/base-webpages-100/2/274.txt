John Kerry, the US secretary of state, called on world leaders to reach for an ambitious deal to fight climate change in a visit to UN negotiations on Thursday.
The appearance of a high-profile official such as Kerry at a critical stage of the talks will send a powerful signal of Barack Obama’s continued commitment to climate action, US officials say.
Kerry did not make any new announcements and US officials say he will not be jumping in to take a hands-on role in the talks.
“I do not actually expect Senator Kerry to get involved in the negotiations,” said Todd Stern, the State Department climate change envoy.
But the officials said Kerry’s decision to speak to the meeting would help keep up the momentum around the talks. “I think this is going to demonstrate to the world yet again the US commitment to addressing climate change,” the official said.
In an attempt to get the talks moving Kerry called on negotiators to set aside the old divisions between rich and poor countries and recognise that it would take a global effort to fight climate change. “No single country including the United States can solve this problem or foot this bill alone,” he said. “If we somehow eliminated all of our carbon pollution, guess what? That still wouldn’t be enough.”
Nor would it be enough if China or India cut all their emissions, Kerry went on. “If even one or two major economies fail to respond to the threat, it will counter-act much of the good work that the rest of the world does.”
In a slight at countries such as Australia and Canada, which have backtracked on climate promises, Kerry said industralised countries in particular had to step up. “If you are a big developed nation and you are not helping to lead then you are part of the problem,” he said.
The secretary of state, who made only a brief visit to the talks on Thursday, said countries should be heartened by the example set by the US and China which jointly agreed last month to cut carbon pollution.
“That is a historic milestone and it should send a message to all of us that the road blocks we have had for decades can be removed from our path,” Kerry said.
Kerry, a climate champion since his days in the Senate, adopted climate change and ocean conservation as his key priorities since becoming secretary of state.
A few years ago it would have been unthinkable to suggest a visit by a US secretary of state would boost the prospects for UN climate talks. But Ed Davey, the UK’s energy and climate change secretary, said the atmospherics had changed.
“John Kerry’s leadership, along with that of President Obama, has been critical in getting the world to the point where we are at,” said Davey. “The US, China and others have been a brake on progress in climate change talks. Now we see America working with the European Union and others to try to get successful climate change talks.”
