POPE WATCH: Stormy Weather May Cut Short Tacloban Visit


Jan 16, 2015, 10:57 PM ET
By The Associated Press 

























Pope Francis is visiting the Philippine city devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, on a two-country Asia tour that also took him to Sri Lanka. Here are some glimpses of his trip as it unfolds:

WEATHER PROBLEMS

The pope may cut short his visit to Tacloban because of an approaching tropical storm.

Those who waited for his outdoor Mass in the morning got soaked by rain, and the winds started kicking up as left. A plastic raincoat he wore over his vestments puffed up in the wind during his open-air motorcade.

The weather bureau has raised the storm alert level for Leyte and nearby provinces.

Tropical Storm Mekkhala, with maximum sustained winds of 100 kilometers (60 miles) per hour and gusts up to 130 kph (80 mph), i is expected to make landfall on Samar Island, about 62 kilometers (39 miles) northeast of Tacloban, later Saturday.

The winds are powerful enough to uproot trees and blow away thatched roofs common in the region, the weather bureau said.

THE TYPHOON

Some facts about Typhoon Haiyan, which struck on Nov. 8, 2013:

— Dead or missing: 7,300 people

— Fierce winds and 7-meter (21-foot) waves leveled villages

— One million houses destroyed

— 16 million coconut trees, a major source of livelihood, knocked down

— Worst-hit city of Tacloban is recovering. Shopping malls, hotels and offices have reopened, with cars, taxis and motorcycles clogging downtown streets.

RAINY WELCOME FOR POPE IN TACLOBAN

A rain-drenched but lively crowd wearing yellow and white raincoats welcomed Pope Francis in the typhoon-ravage central Philippine city of Tacloban early Saturday, chanting "Papa Francesco, Viva il Papa!"

Police said about 150,000 people were allowed into an enclosed area near the airport where the pope is celebrating a Mass while tens of thousands more are lined up outside waiting for a chance to get in.

The crowd cheered loudly at the sight of the plane approaching and waved toward the aircraft as it taxied on the tarmac. Dozens of dancing youth in colorful attire, some swaying atop bamboo stilts, smiled broadly as the pope drove by on his popemobile, waving at them.

Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest typhoon on record to hit land, has left more than 7,300 dead or missing.

QUICKQUOTE: "HELP US FORGET AND ACCEPT"

"I hope the pope can help us forget and help us accept that our loved ones are gone. We still cry often and don't talk about what happened."

— Joan Cator, a 23-year-old woman waiting for the pope in Tacloban. She lost two aunts and four nephews and nieces when Typhoon Haiyan hit in November, 2013.

20-YEAR — AND NOW 16-HOUR — WAIT FOR POPE

Jessica Panis wept in 1995 when she couldn't see Pope John Paul II in Manila because her family was too poor to afford the trip to the Philippine capital.

With Pope Francis is coming to her city of Tacloban on Saturday, nothing can stop the bubbly 41-year-old toy store clerk from seeing the pontiff — not a looming storm, not the long hours of waiting, not even the call of nature.
