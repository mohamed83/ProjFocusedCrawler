Its peak winds are now conservatively near 80 mph as it bears down on the Philippines and the visiting Pope Francis.

The Mass in Tacloban was shortened because of an approaching typhoon that had sustained winds of 80 mph and higher gusts.   Remarkable to see @Pontifex in a yellow raincoat delivering his message to #Tacloban as a typhoon threatens the city pic.twitter.com/vJqN9HXoYE — Will Ripley (@willripleyCNN) January 17, 2015  The NY Times Andy Revkin has some good additional coverage: Storm Warnings for Pope’s Planned Climate Stop in the Philippines Original post from 4:54 p.m.    Satellite view of Typhoon (@ryanmaue on Twitter)  Pope Francis and a half million people are gathering in Tacloban, Philippines for a mass this Saturday in the wake of devastating Super Typhoon  Haiyan, which claimed over  6,000 lives in early November 2013 But in a perverse coincidence, a new typhoon is headed in the direction of Tacloban and may make landfall precisely when the mass is expected to occur.   #Mekkhala upgraded to TYPHOON and will move over #Tacloban – where @Pontifex is sked to be. #AmangPH #PopeFrancisPH pic.twitter.com/yLvpaj8kwK — Brandon Miller (@BrandonCNN) January 16, 2015    I really hope .@Pontifex does not make this flight from #Manila to #Tacloban in a few hours. #PopeFrancisPH #AmangPH pic.twitter.com/Kx9LN8CXgV — Brandon Miller (@BrandonCNN) January 16, 2015  This afternoon tropical storm Mekkhala was upgraded to a typhoon,  and has maximum sustained winds of 75 mph.  It is a minimal typhoon, which should not appreciably change in intensity before making landfall Saturday afternoon local time (or approximately 1 a.m. EST Saturday).    GFS model simulation shows deep moisture plume associated with Typhoon Mekkhala (WeatherBell.com)  The storm is nowhere close to as powerful as Haiyan, whose devastating winds were estimated at 195 mph at landfall.  Haiyan is thought to be the strongest weather system to strike land in modern records anywhere in the world.    Pope Francis cuts short his trip to Tacloban, the area in Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan more than a year ago, due to worsening weather. (Reuters)   Though Mekkhala won’t produce a catastrophe on the scale of Haiyan, it is likely to prove disruptive.  Its winds could produce minor damage and rainfall totals approaching 10-12 inches in some areas will likely lead to localized flash flooding.  Around Tacloban, a NOAA rainfall simulation shows the potential for 4-5 inches.    NOAA model simulations show the potential for 4-12 inches of rain from Typhoon Mekkhala through Saturday (NOAA)  After passing the area around Tacloban, it is forecast to head northeast over the main island of Luzon, just south of Manila exiting its west coast by Sunday afternoon.
