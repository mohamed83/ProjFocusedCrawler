Typhoon Disaster in the Philippines - What RNs Can Do to Help!
RN Response Network, 11/10/13
 
RNs: Sign Up, Donate Now to Help Our Response to Typhoon Haiyan  in the Philippines.
Super Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda has left a path of devastation in the Philippines. Communication  channels are not yet re-established to many areas, but current reports  indicate as many as 10,000 deaths, with fears of many more casualties  yet to be assessed. Several hospitals, along with thousands of homes and  schools have been damaged or destroyed, and hundreds of thousands left  homeless – many with long term shelter needs.
The  international community is rallying to respond, and teams are already  on the ground from the UN, local and international NGOs as well as  disaster experts from the US, Australia, and the European Community.

Through  Registered Nurse Response Network (RNRN), NNU is reaching out to support affected Philippine communities,  and the local caregivers who are on the front lines of the response to  Super Typhoon Haiyan

 Volunteer to help If  you are willing to respond to the tragic situation in the Philippines,  please sign up here and provide information on your availability for the  next few weeks.
 Contribute to the RNRN fund established to support disaster relief services. 
 To donate by mail: Make checks payable to CNF/RNRN and mail them to: CNF/RNRN, 2000 Franklin St. Oakland, CA 94612.
