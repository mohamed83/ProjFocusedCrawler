			PBCI CONSULTANT KRIZ CRUZADO GUIDES PAR ORGANIZERS AS HAGUPIT MADE LANDFALL			        


				by Jonathan Cranston 
06.December.2014


Kriz Cruzado at “the humble command center of PAR-DRN, Leyte Chapter.” Kriz heads the Peace And Reconciliation — Disaster Response Network. This community organizing initiative is in partnership with Mennonite Central Committee.Typhoon “Ruby Hagupit” has been maintaining its course towards the Philippines, and has now made landfall in Dolores, Leyte at 2115PHT Saturday. Hagupit has maximum sustained winds of 175 kph near the center and gustiness of up to 210 kph; it is forecast to move west at 16 kph.
An estimated one million people have fled their homes in an attempt to escape the path of the typhoon, which will likely bring devastation in the form of flash floods, landslides, huge storm surges in coastal areas, and heavy sustained winds.
In Ormoc, on the Visayan island of Leyte, PeaceBuilders consultant Kriz Cruzado has been working furiously to coordinate and prepare disaster response volunteers for what will likely be an extremely busy next few days. She has been posting regular situation updates to her Facebook Page. Here are her latest dispatches:

 
1158H: Update from Ormoc City

Ormoc City has storm surge advisory at number 3.
Electricity is now cut off.





All establishments – fast food chains, grocery stores, gasoline stations are now closed and barricaded.
OEDRN response office is now functioning.
We now have lost contact with DRN members in Samar.



1900H: Update from Ormoc:
Forced evacuations have been implemented to secure families living near the coastal area. The wind is quite strong and the rain pours down continuously. No emergency situations reported as yet, or that I have heard of.
Update from Borongan,Eastern Samar (courtesy of Ms. Consuelo Locop, Relief Director of Just Projects International): Very strong winds are felt, electrical posts and big trees are now on the ground. Different churches serve as evacuation centres. One patient died while on evac in the barangay hall of Maydolong.

Update from Dulag, Northern Leyte (courtesy of Pastor Ferds Ferdinand Resurreccion Consebido): The DSWD has provided assistance government-recognised evacuation centres, but not to evacuees sheltered in non-government recognised places like houses and churches. Maybe there’s a reason to this? Can someone help me monitor this situation?
NEEDS IN THE EVACUATION CENTERS:
Mats, flashlights, batteries, blankets, chamber pots, energy biscuits for children, medicines.
More data and information from Samar, Palompon, and Dulag have been reported to the base command. We will update you shortly.

Jonathan Cranston
Jon is from Virginia, USA. When Jon was ten years old, his family moved to Batangas and then to Cainta, Rizal, where his parents taught at Faith Academy for 9 years. He left the Philippines when he was 18 to attend college in the States. “I left a large portion of my soul with the land and the people…” he said. His first summer job was in a Jollibee at the Antipolo-Simbahan Junction, where he was the only “’kano” (short for Amerikano) on the team. He visited Davao twice as a young boy then as a teenager and is glad to be back here in Mindanao.
