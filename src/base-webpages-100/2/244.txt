The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has dispatched an emergency team to the Philippines to launch an urgent response to the humanitarian catastrophe wreaked by Typhoon Haiyan. The super storm struck the country on Saturday, wrecking homes, flooding villages and leaving millions in need of immediate assistance.While initial reports suggested damage and casualties were limited, the storm's impact became clearer on Sunday as information began to trickle in from the field. Some 229 deaths were reported by the National Risk Reduction and Management Council as of 7pm on Sunday. But local government sources have said the numbers could be as high as 10,000, based on the number of individuals who are still missing. And the Council estimates that as many as 9.5 million people have been impacted by the storm.IRC President David Miliband said Sunday, "We have today taken the decision to deploy emergency relief coordinators to the Philippines, with a view to deciding with the host government which of IRC's areas of expertise — from water and sanitation to education — are most needed." [See full statement and press release.]We will report back on the IRC’s assessment and response plans in the coming days.
