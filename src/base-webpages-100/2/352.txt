Natural disasters are a terrifying, but real fact of life.
MTV are looking for stories of kindness and heroism amid Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda).
Did someone save your life during the typhoon? Or perhaps YOU saved someone’s life?
If you would like to share your remarkable story, please get in touch with us. MTV are looking for survivors (aged around 18-25) who would like to tell their stories in a special documentary, about what happened on that fateful day,  how you and your family survived, and how as Filipinos, you have risen above this disaster.
MTV want to hear your stories and share them with the world.
Please in touch via the below mediums if you know anyone that fits the above criteria.
