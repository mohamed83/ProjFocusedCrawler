Nature does not negotiate: climate catastrophe is with us now!

Blogpost by Kumi Naidoo - 7 December, 2014 at 10:19
25 comments






As Typhoon Hagupit hits the Philippines, one of the biggest peacetime evacuations in history has been launched to prevent a repeat of the massive loss of life which devastated communities when Super Typhoon Haiyan hit the same area just over a year ago.
"One of the biggest evacuations in peacetime" strikes a sickening chord. Is this peacetime or are we at war with nature?
I was about to head to Lima, when I got a call to come to the Philippines to support our office and its work around Typhoon Hagupit (which means lash). In Lima another round of the UN climate talks are underway to negotiate a global treaty to prevent catastrophic climate change. A truce of sorts with nature.
But these negotiations have been going on far too long, with insufficient urgency and too much behind the scenes, and not so much behind the scenes, interference from the fossil fuel lobby.
This year, like last year and the year before these negotiations take place against a devastating backdrop of a so-called 'extreme weather event', something that climate scientists have been warning us about if we don't take urgent action.
Tragically, we are not taking urgent action. Nature does not negotiate, it responds to our intransigence. For the people of the Philippines, and in many other parts of the world, climate change is already a catastrophe.
Only one year ago, Super Typhoon Haiyan killed thousands, destroyed communities and caused billions of dollars in damage. Many survivors who are still displaced have this week had to evacuate the tents they have been living in as Typhoon Hagupit carves a path across the country as I write.
It's too early to assess the impact so far - we are all hoping early indications will spare the Philippines of the same pain that was experienced after Haiyan.
Here in Manila, we prepare to travel to the impacted areas in the wake of Typhoon Hagupit, or Ruby, as it has been named. We will offer what minor assistance we can.
We will stand in solidarity with the Filipino people and we will call out those who are responsible for climate change, those who are responsible for the devastation and who should be helping pay for the clean up and for adaptation to a world in which our weather is an increasing source of mass destruction.
With heavy hearts we prepare to bear witness. We challenge those in Lima to turn their attention from the lethargy and process of the negotiations and pay attention to what is happening in the real world.
We call on them to understand that climate change is not a future threat to be negotiated but a clear and present danger that requires urgent action now!
Each year, the people of the Philippines learn the hard way what inaction on emissions mean. They might be slightly better prepared and more resilient, but they are also rightly more aghast that each year - at the same time - the climate meetings seem to continue in a vacuum, not prepared to take meaningful action, not able to respond to the urgency of our time and not holding accountable the Big Polluters that are causing the climate to change with ferocious pace.
Before leaving for Manila I also received a message from Yeb Saño, climate commissioner for the Philippines: "I hope you can join us as we bear witness to the impact of this new super typhoon. Your help would be very valuable in delivering a message to Lima loud and clear."
Yeb was the Filipino chief negotiator for three years at the UN climate talks and recently visited the Arctic on a Greenpeace ship to witness the Arctic sea ice minimum. Two years ago in Doha, as Typhoon Pablo took the lives of many he broke through the normally reserved language of dispassionate diplomacy that dominates UN climate treaty talks:
"Please ... let 2012 be remembered as the year the world found the courage to ... take responsibility for the future we want. I ask of all of us here, if not us, then who? If not now, then when? If not here, then where?"
I am joining Greenpeace Philippines and Yeb to visit the worst hit areas, document the devastation and send a clear message from climate change ground zero to Lima and the rest of the world that the ones that are responsible for the majority of emissions will be held accountable by the communities that are suffering the impacts of extreme weather events linked to climate change.
We will call on the heads of the fossil fuel companies who are culpable for the unfolding tragedy to examine their consciences and accept their historic responsibility. They say the truth is the first casualty of war, in this war against nature, the truth of climate science is unquestionable.
Please join us. Please add your voice by signing our petition calling on Big Polluters to be held legally and morally accountable for climate damages. After signing the petition you will be redirected to a site where you can make a donation to the relief efforts of partner organisations.
Kumi Naidoo is the Executive Director of Greenpeace International.

Wasn't 2012. Wasn't 2013. Wasn't 2014. probably leaders and corporates are looking at 2022 and onwards to combat HXV (Hagupit fifteenth hit). All the projections and figures regarding anything, are around 2030 to 2050. So we are made to believe that WE can keep plundering nature for some more time. No tensions.

I love what Kumi'd doing and the recent TED talk. The petition here is aimed at the big polluters. Though the "big polluters" have a special responsibility, isn't it each of us . . . and not just "them" that's responsible. 
If we want "them" to undercut their livelihood, break corporate culture, make less profit for shareholders . . . are we willing to take similar risks ourselves before asking it of them?
I know it's harder to see what action we can do (when they can just desist), but we each have talents and skills . . .  
Take good care!

We, the citizens of the world, must keep pushing and persuading global leaders in Lima to sign a meaningful, effective  Climate Treaty with legally binding targets and strict timetables substantially to reduce CO2 emissions, switch to clean, renewable sources of energy, conserve energy, and provide the technology and financial resources for the most vulnerable to adapt to  the  already inevitable consequences of a rapidly changing global climate. "Legally binding" is the operational term; no more 2009 Copenhagen-style "Accords", which  leave the decisions to the goodwill of individual countries. Voluntary "Accords" are not worth the paper they are written on.

If nuclear power expansion had not ground to a standstill in the '70's, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in today. Nuclear power is inexpensive, inexhaustible and safe. Fighting nuclear power by fear mongering and the spreading of misinformation such as Greenpeace does is an elitist, selfish and violent enterprise which is threatening humanity and nature. Greenpeace should support nuclear power.

The new reactor design (I believe is called salt reactor) is far more efficient compared to traditional uranium. Since it can use thorium it has a slightly faster output and is a little more sustainable.
Not to mention that nuclear power is more efficient than coal plants.
The point that there is no safe place to store it. Or that its fuel is radioactive and can cause cancer. Or that carbon emissions are greater than traditional fossil fuels.
1: There aren't good ways to store anything. Hence oil spills.
2:Fun fact. If you stood next to a nuclear reactor, like next to the wall of it. You would experience as much radioactivity as in a flight. You would mostly face large radioactivity consequences in either high concentration of radioactivity, or over a long time exposure. And the only chance of high concentration is if 1: you were dropped into a reactor, or a meltdown were to happen (very rare occurence)
3: Sure vehicles and mining operations usually use fossil fuel, they do not use nearly as much as a coal generator, especially overtime, and even the manufacturing of any other product normally has a dangerous emission. Like aluminium processing.

Alizia says: "Why did you have to come to my country, Peru, and spoil a UNESCO World Heritage site, the Nazca Lines?  Before you do anything, make sure you are well acquainted with the circumstances."  What does this mean???  Is she blaming Greenpeace for damages suffered by the Nazca Lines, or is she blaming foreigners on tourist trips?

She is rightly blaming Greenpeace for trampling on Peru's heritage site and damaging it irreversibly. No tourist is allowed into the site.

Nadoos 'apology' is one of the most hypocritical acts I have seen. Still claiming in the 'apology' they were putting up a "message of hope" - when they clearly were just eager to put their brand name up into the sacred humming bird to get attention and donations.
What a gaffe, what a sign for the hubris that has taken over Greenpeace.

And then they slipped their 'activists' out of the country as fast as they could to avoid the music. Leader of the gang, Argentinian Mauro Fernández told the ministry he had forgotten the names of the participating activists. What a contrast to the sentence in the 'apology': "We will cooperate fully with any investigation."

As all stunts of Greenpeace this was not conceived and planned by a provincial group, but fully sanctioned by the top 'politburo' of undemocratically and non-transparently structured Greenpeace.

If that's accurate then we can expect the Hummingbird to retaliate, unless Greenpeace rushes to the hallowed spot and asks for forgivenness, with offerings of nectar from the local flora.  A shaman will have to organize the event.

Danile, ...Peter,
I don't really see anything they did as damaging.  The 'footprints' were only in an adjacent field.  No damage was done to the lines or integrity of the 'Hummingbird'.  Think when you walk in the forest or on dry ground.  The slight footprints you make will be gone in a week from rain and natural erosion.  I think they were very careful, using cloth strips for lettering.  Yes they entered a restricted area, ...so yes a trespassing charge.  Civil disobedience, ...but always being civil in their disobedience.  I have to say I'm all for it to get the message across.

We have to remember too, that this action was taken during the world climate summit meeting in Lima.  Who else takes the initiative to send them a strong message, ...the future is renewable.  Let's them know the world, and millions of Greenpeace members are watching them and holding them accountable for our future.  I can see in the news articles about this, the trolls are out in force.  Trying to discredit Greenpeace, ...get them out of the way so they can just go on about their dirty business.  How ironic the trolls call them eco terrorists.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out who the eco terrorists are.   It isn't Greenpeace that's plundering our earth's finite resources for extreme profit now is it.  The trolls are still licking their lips over this one, ...paid assassins, ...traitors to their own children.

Civil disobedience - what an excuse for selfishly trying to get the world's media attention (brand recognition is the buzz word in the PR industry!) by breaking into one of the most sacred sites of the people of Peru and smear the brand name directly into the humming bird graph. What have the Peruvians done to get such an act of arrogant neo-colonialism forced upon?

Kumi Naidoo may sport the 'civil disobedience' meme on his fan poster on his Facebook site, on Peruvian TV he did not mention any of that. He said, the action was so deplorable, that nobody in the higher ranks in Greenpeace had known of it...

They were stepping on the lines...and worse, they were stupid enough to publish a video about it.

But this is not really the worst impact of this nice piece of activism.

Peru's economy is largly depending on exploitation of  nature, mining is said to have a devastating impact on environment (& heritage)...but politically wanted.

For this reason envionmental groups in Peru have been a pain to right winged political parties for a while...

This was THE chance to clean up with Peruan environmentalists...

...'illegal mining' and the Paris-Dakar rally are not a threat to Nazca-lines, but Greenpeace, of course.

Comprendè? Thank you soo much, wonderful the world is stupid & we do love our friend, the freak.

Jele

PS: and of course no higher ranks are informed at Greenpeace...I believe it is this guy from financial department responsible.

This ONE guy who was sent home a while ago after GPi investments turned out to be less fertile than expected...

I'm sorry, but all I see them being accused of is leaving footprints in an adjacent field.  I've uploaded a couple of pictures for you to have a look.  As you can see in the photo, it was in an adjacent field.  Please do have a look at the terrain there where they placed the letters, and tell me what difference you think a some footprints would make.
I know it was probably not a good idea to enter a place that is sacred to them.  But you know too, their heart was in the right place, ...wanting a future for their people and their children.  They may have used misjudgement because their feelings to help were so strong, ...but they are not criminals.  I can see trespassing, not prison time, ...not for people who acted out, because they care so much.http://www.gratefulchild.org/media/GreenpeacePeru.jpg

...it does not matter what I think!

Fact is that right winged political parties in Peru use this action in order to take care of environmental movement in Peru!!!

And sorry, but I watched a video where Greenpeace-activist's feet where stepping 30cm away from a line...even not being a right winged politician from Peru I consider the adjacent 30cm to the line part of the collibri...and I do not want to know where they stepped at night-time!

I would like to share Annie Leonard's words on the incident...she is CEO of Greenpeace USA and kindly ask to remove this woman from Greenpeace!!!

Thank you, this is exactly what Greenpeace is NOT, no matter who is attacking Greenpeace...

Greenpeace is an ARMY, or it used to be one before turning to be a career to all those sustainable people...shit man, what the fuck is going on, I think we should tell Obama to stop Annie!

Annie Leonard:

"I am deeply disappointed that Greenpeace demonstrated at the sacred Nazca Lines in Peru.

    We have been hearing from many of you and I share your frustration and anger about this situation.

    The decision to engage in this activity shows a complete disregard for the culture of Peru and the importance of protecting sacred sites everywhere. There is no apology sufficient enough to make up for this serious lack of judgment.

    I know my international colleagues who engaged in this activity did not do so with malice, but that doesn’t mitigate the result. It is a shame that all of Greenpeace must now bear.

    For many years Greenpeace US has been making a concerted effort to reach out to and collaborate with diverse constituencies, many of whom share different cultures, values and priorities. We know it’s important for us to be a strong ally who can learn from the leadership of our partners and ensure the work we do reflects and supports all communities.

    The Nazca Lines situation has undermined the trust of many allies and supporters that we have been working so hard to build.

    As Executive Director of Greenpeace US I assure you that our organization will do everything possible to ensure nothing like this ever happens again and that we will strive to protect the planet in the most respectful, effective and collaborative way possible. I know it will take time and substantial effort to rebuild the trust we have lost, and I am committed to doing that. I am also committed to ensuring that those responsible are held accountable and that we put safeguards in place to ensure that nothing like this happens ever again.

    None of these words justifies the pain and anger so many of you are feeling. The next time you hear from me, we will be a better and more respectful Greenpeace"

Dear Mrs Leonard, 

Kumi Naidoo, General in command, said sorry...to the people of Peru, and/or to everybody else feeling offended.

U may repeat the General's apology, but there is nothing else the CEO of a national Greenpeace organisation can contribute to the General's apology!

I hope you got this for the future

PS: Grateful Child, google the video yourself...I tried to ...shit, Greenpeace is such a dump of ambitions who should be in the industry. instead of serving a NGO....

Unfortunately the industry employes PROFESSIONALS...all low profiles, feel free to join Greenpeace.

Hey guys,

we got wonderful news...

We just spoke to our sister, Kristin Asbjörnsen, Director of the RAINBOW QUIRES and soon head of the Musical department at Greenpeace International.

Kristin would be very happy to welcome Sir Walruss Paul McCartney to join the Rainbow-Singers first concert at the Wagner Festspiele in Bayreuth / Germany in July 2015.

Isn't this wonderful news...?

It --Nature-- certainly does not.  For instance, it deals with overpopulation savagely, whatever the species, by sending down upon the offenders a curse of plagues.  This is natural demographic control.  Research on the wildlife of the African savannas discovered that it was not predators that kept down the numbers of huge herds --there are not enough lions and crocodiles to do the job properly-- but parasites that attack the brain and make the poor beasts rotate out of control and collapse, which is terrible to watch.  Superbugs, resistant to all drugs, are already with us, including an unmanageable strain of TB, and will eventually decimate our own crowds like the Ten Plagues of Egypt.  Nothing else can save the planet now.
