Assessing the Damage of Super Typhoon Haiyan
The Guardian reports that downed communication lines and obstructed roads have made it difficult for relief workers to assess the damage and bring aid to the communities that need it. But as of Saturday, Tacloban City and the Samar province have so far seen the largest number of casualties.

Super Typhoon Haiyan Heading toward Vietnam
Originally a Category 5 super typhoon, Haiyan weakened slightly to a Category 4 typhoon on Saturday. But forecasters warn it could strengthen again over the South China Sea as it makes its way towards Vietnam.

Comparing Katrina and Haiyan
Hurricane Katrina's wind gusts may have had a longer reach—they extended more than 100 miles from its center, while Haiyan's reportedly extended 50 miles—but according to CNN, Haiyan was 3.5 times more powerful.

Preemptive Evacuation 
As many as 800,000 people were evacuated before the typhoon made landfall. Vice Mayor Jim Pe of the Coron town of Busuanga told the Associated Press that when Haiyan hit, "it was like a 747 flying just above my roof."

Earth: Your Fragile Planet (PHOTOS)
A view of a lake filled with glacial melt water is seen in Huascaran National Park in Huaraz, Peru on September 18, 2013. The nearby Pastoruri glacier is one of the fastest receding glaciers in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range according to a 2012 paper by the University of Texas and the Huascaran National Park. Peru is home to 71 percent of the world’s tropical glaciers, which are a source of fresh water for millions. Because of global warming, 22 percent of the surface area of Peruvian glaciers has disappeared in the past 30 years alone, according to The World Bank.

Update: On November 10, Reuters reported that officials in the Philippines estimate that more than 10,000 people lost their lives in the typhoon. If you'd like to help the recovery efforts, visit the Philippine Red Cross website to make a donation.
On Thursday morning, Super Typhoon Haiyan began its sweep across the central islands of the Philippines, leaving in its wake massive environmental destruction and a death toll estimate that's surged from 100 to 1,200 in a matter of hours.
Super Typhoon Haiyan is reportedly among the strongest typhoons ever recorded, with wind gusts that at times reached as high as 235 mph. 
Red Cross and U.N. disaster relief teams are reporting widespread power outages, downed bridges, and entire neighborhoods that have been reduced to rubble.
United Nations Disaster Assessment Coordination Team Chief Sebastian Rhodes Stampa said, "The last time I saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the Indian Ocean Tsunami," he said. "This is destruction on a massive scale. There are cars thrown like tumbleweed, and the streets are strewn with debris."
The loss of life is already staggering, and preliminary reports estimate that tens of thousands of survivors lost their homes and their livelihoods.
