About this Site

Welcome to JeffricDOTcom. This site is owned and created last May 1, 2009 by me, Jeffric Pisuena, a Graphic Designer and a Web Developer. I am offering affordable web hosting to filipino's who do not have PayPal/Credit Cards. My Web Hosting Data Centers are not located here in the Philippines since I am just a reseller. Though I am just a reseller (most who offers web hosting are), rest assured that the best service will be given. To view my web hosting offering Click Here.

This website is the home also of my personally developed web-based grading system, eGrades.
