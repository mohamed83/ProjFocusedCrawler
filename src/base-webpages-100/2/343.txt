Some Pinoy musical trends are easy to spot a mile away, but this year is dominated by female-driven pop-stars and that was even more of a pleasant surprise. We saw a number of other prominent players this year.


While every artist on the list has had a great deal of success and many of whom very popular, these singers were selected for their versatility, emotion, vocal range, power and confidence in pop, rock, r&b music. This list includes the likes of Kyla, Julie Anne San Jose, Jonalyn Viray, Sarah Geronimo, Yeng Constantino, Toni Gonzaga and Maja Salvador.
Fans have the power to vote on which female artist has the best voice in music for the year 2014.
