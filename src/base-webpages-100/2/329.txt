Hagupit (Bagyong Ruby) has rapidly intensified today into a powerful Category 5 Super Typhoon (based on JTWC 1-min scale). It continues to move quickly across the Philippine Sea and is threatening parts of Visayas this weekend. Unfortunately, we are still seeing variations in the computer model outputs and there is still great uncertainty as to the exact track of this powerful typhoon.

Based on the official forecast tracks, Hagupit could threaten parts of Visayas beginning Saturday as a powerful typhoon. The Philippine Government has already started to prepare for the worst-case scenario. Likewise, we urge everyone living in the region to start preparing now. Follow the official bulletins and instructions from your local officials.
We’ll continue to monitor and update the progress of Hagupit. Stay safe!
