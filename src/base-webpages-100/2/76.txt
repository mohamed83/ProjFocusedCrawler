Typhoon Hagupit (Ruby) Activation Live

Typhoon Hagupit / Ruby is currently expected to make landfall in South East Samar early Sunday Morning (December 7, 2014).  In support of OpenStreetMap Philliphines, The Philippine Government, Red Cross/Red Crescent, DHN and other Agencies, we have created our first task for this Activation.
 
We have requested new satellite imagery for Samar and other potentially impacted areas. This is being processed for our use.

How you can help map:
This task covers an area with HiRes Bing Imagery. Some of this area was sporadically mapped during the Haiyan response, but we need to improve on this work and add new features for this Response.
 
We will be looking to add or improve the following features:roads; schools, hospitals, churches, buildings, residential and commercial areas and waterfronts, malls, sports complexes.
 
This is a larger area, if you need to split the tiles you can do so up to two times.
 
We ask all Hotties to help in the response and to map this task as quickly as possible. We expect to make tasks available within 24 hours with new imagery covering coastal areas and with a better understanding of exactly where the landfall will occur.
 
How amazing is the HOT community? 
Only 4 hours after the Task and Activation was published to the HOT Community, this is the progress (orange items indicate active edits):
