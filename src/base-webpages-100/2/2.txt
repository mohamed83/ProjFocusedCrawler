Praying for the Philippines 
By Bekah Legg on 09/12/2014 in Disaster Updates, In the News  0

Praying for the Philippines
Typhoon Hagupit, or Ruby as it is locally known, raged over the Philippines for more than three days as it slowly made its way across the archipelago. The storm has now passed, and the sun has returned to reveal huge challenges to communities wanting to return home.
Compassion partner churches have been working on the front line since before the storm hit. More than 3,000 children and their families took refuge at their local projects as the winds howled and they are still being provided with food and shelter. The main office in Manilla has set up a disaster response team and is working to provide relief items, medical support and man power to help with the clean up.
Prayer Points
 Thank God:

That this storm was not as bad as was feared.
That the evacuation of those in coastal areas was a huge success.
For the tireless work of the Compassion staff and other relief workers who have provided shelter and comfort for those in need.

Pray for

God’s peace and security to be known by children and their families who are traumatised by the second typhoon in just over a year.
Continued strength for relief workers.
Supplies to quickly reach those in need.
Wisdom as Compassion Philippines creates a strategy to respond and rebuild.

 
 
 
   




About Bekah Legg
		I am Media and PR manager at Compassion UK. I believe that God’s intention is to see his people live free from abuse, slavery and the confines of poverty. As a follower of Jesus I feel compelled to use my voice to share the freedom that I have been given; to raise my voice to speak for those who are not heard.
As well as working for Compassion UK, I am the editor of Liberti magazine and kept on my toes at home by five fabulous girls and a husband who sings ‘The sun will come out tomorrow’ when he thinks I look like I’m at the end of my tether. This rarely helps. @libertimagazine
