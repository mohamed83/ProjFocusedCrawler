UN climate change talks: what do NGOs think about the Lima Accord?








An agreement was finally reached in Lima’s climate talks late last night. But what do NGOs think about what was achieved?

Thanks for all your contributions. We’ve had a variety of responses but the overwhelming emotion from NGOs seems to be disappointment that the upward swing from September’s UN talks and the People’s Climate Marches failed to deliver clear directions to Cop 21 in Paris next year - where everyone in the sector agrees that solid binding commitments must be agreed. 
Thank you for reading and feel free to leave your thoughts on what happened at Lima and what should happen now in the comments section below.

350.org communications director Jamie Henn has sent us their take. “Negotiators failed to build on the momentum coming into these talks. Over the past year, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand climate action–millions more will join them in the year ahead. Politicians can either ride that wave, or be swept away by it.
We were pleased to see around 100 countries support the goal of phasing out carbon emissions by mid-century. The goal’s inclusion in the draft text is a win for the fossil fuel divestment movement and will add momentum to that growing campaign. But action must begin now, not after decades of delay.
We must continue to take on the biggest barrier to progress: the fossil fuel industry. During COP20, more than 53,000 people call on the UN to ban fossil fuel industry lobbyists from the climate talks. We know that companies like Chevron and Shell are working behind the scenes to block action. They don’t deserve a seat at the table when they’re trying to burn it down.
These climate talks have shown a clear disconnect between the negotiations and the global movement offering real, immediate solutions to the climate crisis. Regardless of the outcome falling short, the movement continues to grow unabated.”

Representing the human rights perspective at the talks, Jane Cohen senior researcher on environment at Human Rights Watch said:
“We were hoping to come away from Lima with a good basis for a robust climate agreement that protected the human rights of people around the world. Unfortunately what happened in Lima fell far short of that, with a weak decision on emissions and virtually no progress on protecting the rights of millions of people who are and will be affected by climate change.”

Louise Whiting, senior policy analyst at WaterAid was more positive than some. She said the talks have “opened the door to a stronger deal in Paris next year” and are “a step in the right direction”. She is clear however that “there is a lot of work to do over the next 12 months” to secure a global agreement on “drastic cuts”.

Some more from Brandon Wu at ActionAid USA:
“We wanted three primary things from Lima: clear indications of how developed countries would scale up climate finance leading up to the promised $100bn per year in 2020; assurance that “loss and damage” would be a core pillar of the new climate regime to be decided in 2015; and concrete commitments to reduce emissions in the immediate short term (pre-2020). Lima delivered none of these things. 
“For developing countries this was no outcome at all. There is no new money to help them adapt to climate impacts or transition to cleaner economies. There is no assurance that they will be supported in their efforts to deal with loss and damage. And hope is rapidly fading that developed countries will act urgently to reduce their emissions to stop the climate crisis from getting worse.
“The bright side was that social movements, NGOs, development professionals and other members of civil society (including laboir unions, youth, indigenous peoples, women and gender organisations) were virtually united in speaking the truth about the Lima talks: that while governments might hail it as a step forward, however tentative, in reality the talks delivered nothing at a time when taking action is becoming increasingly urgent, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable.
“The recent mobilisations in New York and Lima – in which impacted people were front and centre – show that there’s a growing understanding that climate change is not just an issue for environmentalists, but one that affects everyone’s lives, livelihoods, and human rights. The work we have to do moving forward is to capitalise on this momentum and build the power we need to force our governments to tackle this issue with the urgency and seriousness that science and justice demand.”

We’ve just spoken to David Nussbaum chief executive of WWF-UK who said that “overall it was a disappointing outcome”. After a positive start to the talks, riding on the back of the UN summit in September and the New York climate march, he said that ended up “an opportunity not taken”.
“We know where we need to get to - we need to get to a deal in Paris that secures a safe and stable climate. The challenge we’ve got is that parts of the map of how to get there from Lima are missing. There’s a fundamental gap between scientific necessity and what is politically possible.”

Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre director Dr Maarten van Aalst said: 
“Lima was an important step, but there is still a lot of work to do to reach a deal in Paris, and we’ll need to step up our level of ambition. Interestingly, some people are starting to feel that in some ways the United Nations Framework for the Convention on Climate Change needs to catch up with the calls for action, and real progress on the ground, around the world.
“We may need to think out of the box to achieve more of that momentum. One of my most exciting moments in Lima was an art project by Tomas Saraceno: a lighter-than-air sculpture from trash plastic bags collected by Peruvian Red Cross volunteers.”

ActionAid were not impressed by the agreement. Brandon Wu at ActionAid USA called it “a pathetically weak outcome” and Farah Kabir at ActionAid Bangladesh said the talks had “failed poor farmers, especially women farmers around the world”.
Harjeet Singh at ActionAid International had this summary: 
“We came to Lima hoping that these negotiations would finally deliver what’s needed to help poor people adapt to the effects of climate change. These hopes were in vain. As the Peruvian glaciers melt, and farmers around the world face dry rivers and warmer temperatures, the need for support could not be clearer. Yet the demand for adaptation and finance have been repeatedly ducked. It’s as if the world has forgotten that climate change is already causing unprecedented loss and damage.”

From World Development Movement’s director Nick Dearden:
“Sadly, what we saw in Lima was an extension of what we’ve seen in previous climate talks with rich countries and the biggest polluters setting an agenda that completely fails to keep anyone within safer boundaries of climate change, while doing next to nothing for those countries who are already feeling the impacts now, or who will be in the future.
“Richer countries have a clear financial obligation to assist countries in the global south in adapting to the unavoidable impacts of climate change, but in Lima they again dodged the question of how this would be included in a post-2020 agreement.”

Summary

COP20, the United Nations climate change conference in Lima, ended last night with an agreement. But what do NGOs think about what was and wasn’t achieved? What are the repercussions for developing countries? And what are the organisations who were there planning to do next?
