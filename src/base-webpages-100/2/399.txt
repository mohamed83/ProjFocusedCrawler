Philippines on alert as typhoon Hagupit approaches  




Philippines on alert as typhoon Hagupit approaches

December 3, 2014

Typhoon  Hagupit is presently churning very close to the Island of Yap and is expected to intensify further into a super typhoon in next 48 hours. According to Skymet Meteorology Division in India, as the typhoon passes by, the island will witness torrential rains, dangerously rough surf and damaging winds gusting up to 185 kmph. It will start witnessing inclement weather from the Wednesday afternoon itself.
Local authorities have issued a warning to the residents of the Philippines against the possible severe dangers from  a strengthening Hagupit.
Meteorologists forecast that Hugapit, which is expected to intensify into a super typhoon by weekend, has two possible tracks. The first track could move it westwards, where it would hit the southern or central Philippines by the weekend. This could be more dangerous as significant number of population of Philippines reside here. The cyclone would have great impact as it will bring damaging typhoon winds, pounding surf, inundating storm surge and flooding rain.
Alternatively, Hugapit may move northwestwards through the Philippine Sea, just skirting Philippines and heading towards Japan. If this happens, Philippines would be spared of heavy rain but rough surf will be witnessed. Japan may, however, feel its impacts along the southern coast by next week.
