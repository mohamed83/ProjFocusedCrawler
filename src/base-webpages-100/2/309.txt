      Typhoon Haiyan: Inside the IRC’s emergency response

                  In the wake of Typhoon Haiyan, the IRC is focused on getting clean water to people in some of the most isolated  areas in the western Visayas region of the Philippines.                                      Photo: Reuters                          



 The swath of destruction Typhoon Haiyan cut through the Philippines on Nov. 8 is almost unimaginably vast. Some 13 million people have been affected by the storm – one of the most powerful typhoons ever recorded. Almost 4 million have been displaced from their homes.  The International Rescue Committee’s emergency response team has been deployed to the archipelago and is mobilizing our response. We are focused on three areas: water, sanitation and hygiene – helping to prevent outbreaks of disease; health – reopening health clinics and hospitals and getting them back in working order, and livelihoods – programs that will put some money back into people’s pockets and help to revitalize the local economy.What is clear from everything we are seeing on the ground is that access to uncontaminated water is a top priority. Safe drinking water difficult to come by. Using water filtration systems, the IRC is focused on getting clean water to people in some of the most isolated areas in the western Visayas region – provinces like Aklan and Antique where some 600,000 people have been displaced but very little aid is getting through.The IRC is also focused on kick-starting local markets through a mixture of livelihood programs – what are called cash-for-work programs like clearing debris, or building latrines so that local Filipinos can participate in the rebuilding of their communities in exchange for cash.Everything that the IRC does on the ground in the Philippines is done while at the same time ensuring that the protection of those most vulnerable in an emergency – women, children and the elderly – is at the forefront. For example, when we build sanitation centers and latrines we make sure that they are well-lit, and that they are separated by gender to give women and girls the privacy and protection they need. We’re also working in close coordination with local and international aid efforts, using all our resourcefulness to circumvent wrecked transportation systems and other obstacles the typhoon has thrown in our path.The people of the Philippines have seen incredible devastation, but they are resilient and educated, and ready to rebuild. What they need are the tools to rebuild – and the IRC is committed to helping them to do just that.Learn MoreGet the latest updates from IRC aid workers responding to Typhoon Haiyan. How to HelpDonate now to support the IRC’s work in the Philippines.
