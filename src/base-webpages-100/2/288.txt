Tackling climate change: a coffee farmer’s view

Small-scale farmers and agricultural workers in developing countries are among those most affected by the impacts of climate change. Unpredictable and extreme weather including higher temperatures, reduced rainfall, floods and droughts can dramatically reduce yields and may lead to some regions becoming unsuitable for crops that have grown there for many years. 
Confronting these challenges is vital not only to protect the livelihoods of farmers and workers, but to ensure the continued supply of commodities we consume on a daily basis, such as coffee and cocoa. 
In a joint statement issued ahead of this year’s UN climate change summit in Peru (COP20), Fairtrade’s producer networks in Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America said that while the Fairtrade system has empowered producers to trade their way out of poverty, climate change threatens to erode the gains that have been made. 
Calling for governments and international actors involved in the agricultural sector to give greater support to farmers, they said: “Although Fairtrade provides great support, much more is needed to help smallholder farmers face these challenges and be able to continue to feed the world. There is an immediate, urgent need to increase resilience to climate change and access more funding opportunities for climate change adaptation.”
Raúl Caso Yupanqui, the 26-year-old general manager of the Cooperative Agroindustrial Sonomoro in Peru, attended the UN summit as part of a delegation from the Fairtrade producer network for Latin America and the Caribbean (CLAC), and Fairtrade International. 
“Before coming to the conference, I thought the main topics would be reforestation, water management and carbon projects as I believed these were the only options. But by taking part in this conference, I have realised that there are many potential options,” Raúl said. “I think one of the most important tools in fighting climate change is information. If the farmers don’t get proper information about climate change, then it is impossible to act.”
With funding from Lidl Germany, Fairtrade has been supporting farmers in Raúl’s cooperative to become more resilient to climate change, for example by planting shade trees among their coffee bushes, erecting wind barriers, and replanting crops lost to coffee leaf rust with disease resistant varieties. 
A “train the trainers” approach, delivered by TWIN, has increased climate change awareness among farmers and according to Raúl, involving cooperative members in the project has been an important factor in its success. 
“All the promodores [lead farmers who took part in the training], including me, were sons or daughters of coffee farmers. This was very important, as we then understood immediately the problems of climate change and we were able to transmit the information to our families much more easily than if it was just being done by an external representative of the cooperative,” Raúl explains. 
Giving his impression of the summit, Raúl said it had been both interesting and helpful to learn what others are doing to tackle the challenges created by climate change. 
“It was important for me to attend an event of the Peruvian ministry of environment today. They explained about an agroforestry project, also in coffee, here in Peru, which I knew nothing about before. So I was able to input and also to realise that there are projects going on in Peru that could be interesting for my cooperative too and obtain more information about them.” 
The Sonomoro cooperative is now looking towards the next stage of its climate adaptation project, which is likely to focus on agroforestry. 
“In the past, when the producer received plants or trees to plant amongst the coffee bushes on their farm, they didn’t actually do it, but now they understand that it is a really important way to counter the negative impacts of climate change,” Raúl said. 
The cooperative is also interested in planting bamboo, which could help to prevent soil erosion, keep soil fertile and increase carbon sequestration. A further benefit is that it would enable the farmers to diversify into selling bamboo products, providing an additional source of income.
Asked what he would like governments to do to support small farmers facing the effects of climate change, Raúl suggested they might take steps to stop informal mining, which negatively impacts on the environment through water pollution and deforestation and encourages farmers to take an agroforestry approach. “That means not just food production, but planting trees, ensuring biodiversity and so on.”
The UN climate change summit may be drawing to a close, but it’s vital that the views of smallholder farmers continue to be heard within the international climate debate.
