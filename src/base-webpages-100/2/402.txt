Qualities:

:: Emotionally stable and positive
:: Initiative and a willingness to take command and instructions
The following profiles are needed:
:: Documenter and photographer (please bring your own gear)

You will need to provide your own funds. Examples of budget for volunteers:

About the author


 
Salome Haldemann
Salome is our intern from Eglise Evangélique Mennonite de Strasbourg, France. She has been a scout chief for the last 5 years that helped her gain solid common sense and resourcefulness. As an occupational therapist by profession, she has a very good knowledge of human health. She is currently in the stage of her journey when she’s developing “a strong interest for the meaning of a radical discipleship,” and she’s realizing that “there is nothing more revolutionary than building true peace.”
