 By DOST Project NOAH, PAGASA Storm Surge Component
This list is a refined version of PAGASA’s general advisory for storm surges and is issued more than a day ahead of Typhoon Ruby’s (Hagupit) landfall. It serves as a guideline for timely, steady and organized evacuation of communities, residents and families living in the affected areas. According to PAGASA’s Severe Weather Bulletin Number Ten, those living in coastal areas under signal no. 3 are alerted against possible occurrence of 4.5-meter storm surges. Do not evacuate during the typhoon as flying debris caused by strong winds can cause fatal casualties and loss.

Just wondering why there are no storm surge data for some critical areas like Tacloban, Palo, Tanauan, Tolosa, and Dulag.  These areas were severely affected by last year’s storm Yolanda especially by deadly storm surges.  If NOAH doesn’t have the facilities to measure possible storm surges in these places, what would be the listed municipalities would we refer to as comparable to our situation?  Thanks.

PAGASA may need to consider the effect of high tide on typhoon Ruby.
I made a call to my family in the province just tonight to check on them. Talking with my father, he asked me to reach out PAGASA for possible consideration on the effect of high tide/full moon on typhoon Ruby as he did not notice TV or radio news on this.  
We should call to mind that on Saturday, December 6, 2014 is a full moon. This means that the rise of the sea level or high tide can be expected as a combined effect of the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and sun and the rotation of the earth.  While some locations experience only one high tide, ours in Northern Samar, we experience two (2) high tides in a day.  
Based on the news, the typhoon continued to gather strength as it moved over water. The rise of sea level is on the assumption of a normal scenario of a storm surge.  Considering possible effect of the high tide, this would cause a much higher rise of the sea level.  Storm surge on a high tide can be more intense.
In short, the data disclosed by PAGASA through the local TV station maybe considerably underestimated.  
We could save more lives by helping one another – with the sharing of experience, knowledge, or simply passing on information to those who might be affected … let’s act the part.

Yesterday, I was looking for Tacloban City but I didn’t find it in the Storm Surge Advisory list. Does this mean Tacloban is not in danger of storm surge?  Naval, Biliran was in the list yesterday; today, however, it is not anymore in the list.  Does this mean also that we do not have to worry about storm surge in Naval?
