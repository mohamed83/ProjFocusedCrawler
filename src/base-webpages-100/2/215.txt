Typhoon Haiyan: Emergency response in the Philippines




The devastation left by Typhoon Haiyan is a humanitarian catastrophe. The International Rescue Committee and our partners in the Philippines are focusing on water, sanitation and shelter needs, along with programs that will protect those most vulnerable in the wake of a disaster: women, children and the elderly. We've also set up livelihoods programs to put some money back into people’s pockets and help to revitalize the local economy. Get updates from IRC aid workers, partners and others who are responding to and reporting on the crisis.Donate now to support families devastated by Typhoon Haiyan »  [View the story "Typhoon #Haiyan Emergency Relief" on Storify]
