Typhoon Usagi has unleashed torrential rain and ferocious winds in Taiwan, leaving tens of thousands without power after the storm claimed at least two lives in the Philippines.

Southern Taiwan has been hit hard by the storm, which has reached maximum sustained winds of up to 120mph, according to the Hong Kong Observatory.
As the storm headed for Hong Kong, residents in the city have reinforced windows in anticipation of impact.
Local airline Cathay Pacific has warned that all its flights in and out of the city will be cancelled.

In Taiwan's southern Pintung county, storms have flooded remote villages and forced troops to rescue dozens of people, the state Central News Agency said.
"I thought a tsunami was hitting ... I've never encountered this before in my life," said a 60-year-old woman who scrambled to safety as the storm hit.
Six people were injured in Kinmen, a Taiwan-controlled island off China's southeastern Fujian province, after they were hit by fallen trees.
The typhoon also left 45,000 homes without power and more than 5,000 households without water.




The storm lashed Taiwan's southern areas

A total of 77 domestic and five international flights have been cancelled and ferry services suspended, with schools and offices in many parts of Taiwan closed, especially in the south and east.
The defence ministry deployed more than 3,000 soldiers to "high-risk" areas and placed 24,000 others on standby.
The Philippines' National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council has confirmed that a man aged about 50 and a woman of about 20 drowned in the storm.

Two women are also missing after a boat capsized the previous day. Nine passengers and crew were rescued.
In Hong Kong, officials have issued a standby signal number three, the second in a five-step tropical cyclone warning system with winds expected to strengthen.
China's National Meteorological Center issued a red alert - its highest-level warning - as it forecast gale-force winds and heavy rain.
It said Usagi would affect the coastal areas of the provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang and Fujian.
