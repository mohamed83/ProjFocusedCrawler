Inside Typhoon Hagupit and reporting from the outskirts people relaying information on whats going on in side this storm on social media and other sources. Below is a few twitter feeds we have been following to get information out of Typhoon Hagupit / Ruby.
The first few are from trusted sources from inside the storm.  One thing about social media though is that if you do search for a Hashtag with #Ruby / #Hagupit in it there may be a slew of false photos or videos from previous storms. This is the downside of social media news, anyone can post photos and sometimes it could be false, so when hearing major news over twitter or facebook always try to find a second source.
