Rivers burst their banks and submerged villages in floods up to ‘neck-deep’ while hillsides crashed onto homes and highways, local authorities say.
At least 30 people were killed in landslides and flash floods and thousands have been evacuated as Tropical Storm Seniang drifts northwest through the Philippines, unleashing torrents of rainfall that have led to deadly landslides and severe flooding. More than 13,000 travelers have been stranded as choppy seas shut down travel between the country’s many islands, and at least one bridge has been destroyed by floodwaters, Rappler reported.

Ten flights to and from the affected areas on Tuesday were cancelled.
Seniang will be out of the central region after midnight Wednesday before brushing the southern tip of Palawan island on its way out of the country on Friday, according to the state weather bureau.
Last year Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), the strongest ever to hit the country, left 7,350 people dead or missing in central regions as it stirred up tsunami-like waves, wiping out entire towns.
