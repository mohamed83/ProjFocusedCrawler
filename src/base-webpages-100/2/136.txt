Max UK wind speeds – 10 December 2014

2014


UPDATED AT 11:30AM ON 10th DECEMBER 2014
Parts of the UK are being affected by strong winds today – particularly the north-western coast of Scotland.
Winds are generally much lighter in south-eastern parts, although still gusty – particularly around coasts.
We’ll be updating this post through the day with the maximum wind speeds (from non-mountain sites) seen so far.

Winds are almost always stronger at our high level weather stations (those that are sited at 500 metres of altitude or higher), which are also often very exposed.  For this reason the winds from those sites are unlikely to reflect what the vast majority of people are experiencing. Bearing that in mind, the strongest gusts from the high level sites are quoted below for reference:
