 Typhoon trivia: How 'Hagupit' got its name ANC Wednesday, December 3, 2014  ANC It's easy to think Hagupit is the typhoon's local name, but that's actually its international name. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) will call it Ruby, once it enters the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR)."Hagupit," a Philippine term, is one of five terms we contributed to the list of international names for tropical cyclones adopted by the United Nations Economic and Social commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the World Meteorological Organization Typhoon Committee.Every year, the Philippines and countries in Asia—namely Cambodia, China, Korea, Hongkong-China, Japan, Laos, Macau-China, Malaysia, Micronesia, Thailand, and Vietnam—along with the US work with five lists of contributed names for tropical cyclones.So far, we're using the third list.Incidentally, the term "hagupit," which means "lash" or "flog," was previously used in 2008 when a typhoon by that name hovered in the Pacific from September 19 to 23.That typhoon entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility and bore the local name "Nina." It crossed the Babuyan Channel in extreme Northern Luzon on September 22, 2008, raising Signal Number 3 in Batanes, Cagayan, Ilocos Norte, and Apayao.Aside from Hagupit, other names we've contributed to the list include "Maliksi," "Danas," "Lupit," and "Talas."
