Refugees are people  just like you and me. Though they are faced with a grim choice - stay and die, or flee and risk  imprisonment, rape, torture and forced recruitment by armed groups. 
UNHCR is the only organization mandated to act as  a safety net and protect over 51 million of the most vulnerable people in the  world - which is why we need your donations to help those who need it the most.
As the United Nations refugee agency, we care  for refugees by providing a tent for shelter, clean water, sanitation and vital  health care. Without UNHCR, many refugees would not survive. 
Donate today to help refugees and help continue  our life-saving work.
