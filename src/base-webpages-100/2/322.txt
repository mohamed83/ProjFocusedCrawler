NAVAL, Biliran, December 12 (PIA) – Partial report of the Biliran Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) chaired by Governor Gerardo J. Espina, Jr. indicated that the province of Biliran suffered damages to infrastructures, agriculture, partially and totally damaged houses and power and electricity amounting to P72,504,638.49.

According to the  report of the Biliran PDRRMC which was submitted  to the Office of the Civil Defense (OCD), assessment of damages brought by typhoon Ruby is progressing as the eight municipalities of Biliran province are also continuing assessment in their respective areas.
The report further said that in the eight municipalities of Biliran province, there were 4,406 partially damaged houses while the totally damaged houses numbered to 413.
Only one casualty was reported as a result of typhoon Ruby.  The victim, a 60-year old man and a resident of Brgy. Bool Central in the municipality of Culaba identified as Ridmoro Baylon.
The report revealed that the P72,504,632.49 amount of initial damage was broken down as follows:  partially and totally damaged houses amounted to P37,037,000;  roads – P23,200,000;  power and electricity – P2,696,338.49;  damage to agriculture on crops – P7,962,800;  fisheries- P581,000, and livestock – P140,000.  Damage to building and stocks of the National food Authority (NFA), Biliran provincial office was placed at P887,500.

Rapid assessment of the damage brought by typhoon Ruby was conducted immediately within 72 hours by the PDRRMC after the typhoon to enable humanitarian agencies and international organizations who are now in Biliran province to respond to the needs of the victims and the communities.
The PDRRMC further reported that assessment of typhoon damage is currently on-going by the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (MDRRMC) of the eight municipalities of the province for the succeeding update reports of typhoon damage in Biliran to be submitted to the OCD and the RDRRMC 8.
