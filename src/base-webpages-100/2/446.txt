Local people were "nonchalant" in the hours before Typhoon Haiyan hit Taclaban, a storm chaser in the Philippines has said.

Josh Morgerman said his impression was that people "were not worried" about the typhoon, which went on to kill thousands of people as it tore across the Philippines.
The professional storm chaser spoke of the moment fierce winds of up to 147mph (235kmph) hit the city as pictures emerged of the enormous scale of the damage.

"On Friday morning, as the centre of the typhoon approached, it just went crazy and the wind got really violent," he said.
"We were in a thick concrete building that was trembling from the force of flying debris hitting it. All the windows were exploding and everything, glass flying everywhere.

"Then the deadly thing happened, which is that the storm surge just swept into the city and the entire downtown area was under water."
Mr Morgerman said the first floor of his hotel was under water, and he entered "rescue mode" to help those who were in danger of drowning.
"It was a small typhoon and it moved very quickly but it was extremely severe and it did its work quickly," he added.
Once the storm had passed, the shoreline and streets were unrecognisable.
"It was just piles of rubble and you couldn't even tell what had been there," Mr Morgerman added.
"There were just dead bodies in the street. People just seemed shell-shocked - almost like zombies - walking around and trying to understand what happened."
