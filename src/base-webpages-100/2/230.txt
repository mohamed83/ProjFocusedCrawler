A devastating storm that struck the Philippines over the weekend has sparked calls for immediate action, and National Nurses United’s relief network is mobilizing.On Sunday, a powerful typhoon struck the nation and killed as many as 10,000 people. The storm that hit the Pacific island nation was one of the most powerful in history. The damage was massive, with hundreds of thousands of people left homeless and schools and homes destroyed.In response, National Nurses United’s Registered Nurse Response Network project has called for volunteers and donations. The group has experience mobilizing in response to other natural disasters.“As U.S. nurses we have seen the effects of deadly storms and disasters and the pain it causes for our families and communities,” said Zenei Cortez, vice president of National Nurses United, in a statement. “We know the difference it makes to provide support and assistance in a hour of need. We will do whatever we can to aid our sisters and brothers in the Philippines.”National Nurses United is the biggest union of nurses in the country. In 2004, they set up the Registered Nurse Response Network to send nurses to disaster areas.To make a donation, click here.
