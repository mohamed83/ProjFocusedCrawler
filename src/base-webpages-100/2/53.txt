Hagupit has weakened since Saturday but still threatens a third day of flooding to the Philippines on Monday, including the capital city of Manila. Since Saturday’s landfall, Hagupit’s winds have weakened to 50 mph, or tropical storm status. Typhoon Hagupit crawled through the Philippines over the weekend at the “agonizingly slow” of around seven miles per hour, which all but guaranteed extremely high rainfall totals across the island of Samar. Borongan City, south of where Typhoon Hagupit’s eye made landfall on the east side of Samar, picked up 15.6 inches (395.6 mm) of rainfall in 24 hours. Catbalogan City, on the west coast of the island, accumulated 14.2 inches (360.2 mm) in 24 hours. Both locations picked up additional rainfall through Sunday. Ahead of Hagupit’s landfall, NOAA satellite estimations were forecasting 24-hour rainfall totals to exceed 12 inches across Samar, though accumulation in the higher mountain elevations were likely much larger.    Satellite derived 24-hour rainfall estimates were in excess of 12 inches over northern Samar Island ahead of Hagupit’s landfall. (NOAA/eTRaP Program)  Western Samar was also inundated by a powerful storm surge, possibly up to 15 feet in height according to some model estimates.

(Project NOAH)  Hagupit’s landfall was not as severe as Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which left over 6,000 people dead in its wake. Tacloban City was the hardest hit in Haiyan, but was spared the worst impacts in Hagupit. However, Hagupit was still a deadly storm, reports the Associated Press: Hagupit left at least 21 people dead, including 16 villagers who drowned in Eastern Samar province, where the typhoon made its first landfall, according to the Philippine Red Cross. The government disaster-response agency has reported only five other deaths, including three people who died of hypothermia, saying it was still verifying other reported casualties. Displaced villagers have been asked to return home from emergency shelters in provinces where the danger posed by the typhoon had waned, including Albay province, where more than half a million people were advised to leave evacuation sites.

Over Manila now pic.twitter.com/z6xYPnb2YZ — Eric Holthaus (@EricHolthaus) December 8, 2014     Typhoon Hagupit was the equivalent of a category 3 hurricane just before landfall, with sustained winds of 125 mph. (NASA)  Hagupit, though it has weakened to tropical storm status though is still only tracking west at six miles per hour, continues to inundate the Philippines. On Monday, the tropical storm was tracking west over the Batangas province, just south of the capital of Manila. Satellite estimates suggest that rain is coming down at a rate of 1.4 inches per hour over a widespread region just southeast of Manila. Weather Underground’s Jeff Masters writes about Manila’s prospects: Since Hagupit is likely to track very close to the capital city of Manila as a strong tropical storm or weak Category 1 typhoon, heavy rains of 10 – 15″ could affect this heavily populated part the country resulting in yet another billion-dollar typhoon disaster for the Philippines. Hagupit’s closest approach to Manila will likely come around 06 UTC [1 a.m. eastern time] on Monday. In addition, special lahar warnings have been put out for mudslides for two volcanoes along Hagupit’s path, Mayan and Bulusan, whose flanks have unstable ash deposits from recent eruptions. A total of 650,000 people have been evacuated for Hagupit, and I am hopeful this effort will keep the death toll relatively low. Hagupit will continue to drench the Manila area through Monday, though should move west out of the Philippines by Tuesday morning, eastern time. The tropical storm will continue southwest through the South China Sea before reaching southern Vietnman on Thursday as a weak tropical cyclone.
