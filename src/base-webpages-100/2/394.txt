Top 5 devastating storms of 2014  




Top 5 devastating storms of 2014

January 17, 2015

2014 was relatively a less eventful year in terms of natural disasters. The combined economic losses amounted to 132 billion US dollars, which is 37% below the 211 billion dollar per year average damages from the previous ten years, according to the Annual Global Climate and Catastrophe Report.
Here, we are talking about the top 5 storms that caused immense destruction in terms of life and property. Cyclone Hudhud, which devastated the eastern coast of India, was by far the most expensive tropical cyclone in India's history.
Cyclone Hudhud 

Tropical Cyclone Hudhud made landfall near Visakhapatnam in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh on October 12 as a Category 4 storm with a wind speed of 180 kmph. With an estimated damage of 11 billion dollar, Hudhud was by far the most expensive tropical cyclone in India's history.
Cyclone Hudhud, after battering coastal Andhra Pradesh and Odisha on October 13 kept losing steam as it travelled across Chhattisgarh, Bihar and east Uttar Pradesh. Torrential unseasonal rain and squally winds caused immense damage to standing crops, which were almost ready for harvesting.
The death toll from Hudhud was held to 68, which was far below the death toll of 9,843 people during the similar-strength 1999 Orissa Cyclone.
Typhoon Rammasun

Rammasun,  meaning “thunder of God,” was the strongest typhoon to hit China’s Hainan Province in last 41 years. Rammasun peaked as a Category 4 super typhoon. Rammasun killed 206 and the damage caused was worth 7.2 billion dollars.
Typhoon Kalmaegi

Typhoon Kalmaegi hit the Philippines, China, and Vietnam between September 10 - 16, claiming at least 31 lives. It caused an estimated damage of 3 billion dollars. The typhoon first made landfall as a Category 1 storm in the Philippines’ Luzon Island.
Hurricane Odile

Hurricane Odile made landfall on September 15 as a Category 3 storm, near Cabo San Lucas in Mexico. The strongest storm to hit Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula claimed five lives and injured 135 people. The damage was estimated at 2.5 billion dollars.
 Cyclone Ita

Severe Tropical Cyclone Ita was the strongest tropical cyclone to impact Queensland in Australia since Cyclone Yasi, three years back. It made landfall at Cape Flattery on April 12 and caused a total damage of 1 billion dollars.
