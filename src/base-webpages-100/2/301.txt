On 21 September the biggest climate march in history is planned to take place in cities such as New York and London according to organisers. Ricken Patel, executive director of digital campaign group Avaaz, one of the organisers of the People’s Climate March, said the demonstration was intended to send a signal to those world leaders, who are expected to include David Cameron and Barack Obama, though not heads of state from China and India.
