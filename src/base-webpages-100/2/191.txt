Tropical Rain Disrupts Rescue Operations in Philippines

The weather across Asia is detailed in the above AccuWeather.com video.

In the wake of once-Super Typhoon Haiyan, another tropical disturbance has brought downpours to areas devastated by Haiyan.
The death toll across the Philippines from Haiyan (local name Yolanda) could rise to 10,000, as reported by the Associated Press.
Even a passing shower or thunderstorm would dampen and hinder the recovery, but the danger of tropical downpours will continue through midweek.

The tropical disturbance responsible for this heavy rainfall was named Tropical Depression Zoraida by the Philippines government.
Thus far a general 25-75 mm (1-3 inches) has fallen across the central and southern Philippines with locally higher amounts.
The threat of the heaviest rainfall will shift into the west-central Philippines through Wednesday, local time. This will bring some relief to the areas hardest hit by Haiyan; however, brief downpours will still be possible.

The weather pattern will shift to more of a traditional trade wind dominated regime from Thursday through the end of the week. This will limit the threat of any heavy rainfall; however, passing showers and isolated thunderstorms will be possible each day.
This more tranquil weather pattern is expected to continue into the first half of next week which would aid any rescue and recovery efforts across the region.
This story was originally published on Friday, Nov. 8, 2013, with content contributed by AccuWeather.com Meteorologists Eric Leister and Courtney Spamer.
