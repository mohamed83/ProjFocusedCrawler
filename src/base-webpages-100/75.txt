In a tweet, NCP leader Praful Patel said, "The girls will be staying the night in IBIS hotel Delhi tonight and will be in their respective homes tomorrow".The 18 girls and two support staff had been practicing in the stadium for the third-place play-off against Iran when the earthquake shook the venue and adjoining areas.
"We were finishing practice when we saw the stadium shaking," coach Maymol Rocky told PTI from Kathmandu. Hundreds had come to watch the practice session, she said.
"We ran to the middle of the pitch and remained there as we saw buildings collapse in the adjoining areas. It was a real scary moment," she said. "These girls are not even 14 and they have not experienced this kind of scary moment in their lives."
After returning to the hotel, the Indian and the Iranians team decided to sleep in open space inside the hotel premises in Kathmandu in fear of aftershocks.
Earlier today, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had tweeted that the girls would be evacuated on "priority". An official of the All India Football Federation in Delhi had said the team will be brought back to India by military aircraft, reported news agency Press Trust of India.
The team had lost to hosts Nepal in the semifinals on Friday. The players were originally to board a flight for India Sunday.RelatedDelhi Boils as Mercury Settles at 42.7 Degree CelsiusGST to Boost Growth Rate by 1.5 Percentage Points: India IncSamsung Launches Portable SSD T1 Starting at Rs. 12,000Story First Published: April 26, 2015 18:01 IST        Real Estate Bill Sent to Select Committee of Rajya SabhaReal Estate Bill Sent to Select Committee of Rajya SabhaALSO READDelhi Boils as Mercury Settles at 42.7 Degree CelsiusKathmanduDelhiNepalIndiaAll India Football Federation in DelhiSushma SwarajPraful PatelNepal EarthquakeUnder-14 football teamgirls' football team................................
