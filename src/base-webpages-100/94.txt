Nearly four decades ago, 67 year-old Panna Bahadur came to Landour cantonment, today he works as a caretaker in one of the many bungalows which dot the hillside. A week back his wife Gaura Sahi joined him for medical treatment. The couple is now glued to television tracking minute-by-minute new coverage from Kathmandu."There has been an earthquake back home and now we are worried about our children and home. We don't know whether they are safe or not," Mr Bahadur told NDTV.Mr Bahadur and his wife are from Nepalgunj but their youngest son and brothers family were living in Kathmandu working in local eateries.Mobile service providers from India have offered free calling to Nepal. But the severely affected communication network in the Himalayan country has left Ms Sahi more worried. Ever since she heard of the massive earthquake she has been trying to call back home."I have been trying to call my brother and children but I have just not been able to get through them. I am very worried," says Ms Sahi, who has not kept her phone away even for a minute, in the hope that she will hear from her family in Nepal soon.While the couple are still waiting to speak to their relatives in Nepal, daily wage earners Binay bahadur and Ajai Sahi are among the lucky few who have managed to touch base with their families in Nepal.Both belong to a village close to the tourist town of Pokhra in Nepal and had come to India a month ago in search of work."We got the news about earthquake yesterday and since then I have been trying to call home. Finally today morning I got through them," said a visibly relieved Binay."I got a call from home today morning. I was very relieved when my parents told me they are safe and all is well at home," said Ajai.RelatedHigh in the Himalayas, a Search Yields Grim ResultsBad Weather Disrupts Links with Avalanche-Hit Nepal VillageAfter Nepal Quake, Time is Ripe to Push for Safer Buildings: ExpertsStory First Published: April 26, 2015 19:25 IST        Real Estate Bill Sent to Select Committee of Rajya SabhaReal Estate Bill Sent to Select Committee of Rajya SabhaALSO READHigh in the Himalayas, a Search Yields Grim ResultsEarthquakeearthquake damageEarthquake in NepalEarthquake in KathmanduEarthquake CommunicationIndia  earthquakeMussoorieNepal Migrants in India................................
