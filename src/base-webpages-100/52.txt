Rescue dogs leave Oslo for Nepal quake 


  Published: 27 Apr 2015 10:42 GMT+02:00
















A 34-strong Norwegian rescue team - including six rescue dogs - is on the way to Kathmandu to help efforts to find those still trapped by Saturday’s devastating earthquake.

	The Norsar team — comprising a pack of six rescue dogs, rescue experts from Oslo’s fire service, and doctors and nurses from Oslo University Hospital — took off from Oslo’s Gardermoen airport on Monday morning, and hoped to arrive in Nepal in the evening. 

	 

	At least 3,326 people have already been reported dead, and many thousands made homeless by the 7.8-magnitude quake which rocked 

	central Nepal on Saturday. 

	 

	“We hope to rescue and help as many people as possible,” Håvard Bakken, a brigade commander from the Oslo fire services told NTB newswire before departing. “The reason we’re going is to find survivors.” 

	 

	According to Norway’s foreign ministry has contacted all but a handfull of the 200 Norwegians known to have been in Nepal when the earthquake struck and does not believe any have been injured. 

	 

	Many Norwegians in Kathmandu have been staying at the country’s embassy. 

	 

	A 19-strong group of climbers who were either on Mount Everest or preparing to climb it when the earthquake struck have all escaped unscathed. 

	 

	“We have twelve people in the town of Lukla, hoping to fly to Kathmandu today. A further seven were on Mount Everest and are on the way to Lukla,” Trygve Sunde Kolderup, the chief executive of Norway’s Hvitserk tour operators, told NTB.
