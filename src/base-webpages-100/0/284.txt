            If you sign in with your email
            account, we will show your email domain on comments
            to increase your authority and credibility with other
            readers. So if you are the Prime Minister, be sure
            to use your aph.gov.au email address.

          Why?

            On The Conversation, user accounts must be associated
            with an individual's real name. Organisation representatives
            creating accounts also must use their own names.
            Requiring real names helps us maintain a transparent
            and credible forum for discussion and debate.
