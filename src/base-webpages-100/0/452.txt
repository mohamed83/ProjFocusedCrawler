Summary

It's well past midnight in the Philippines and time for a summary of what we know so far of the aftermath of typon Haiyan
• International relief efforts are beginning after Haiyan caused devastation in parts of the Philippines, with initial – and very rough – estimates predicting that 10,000 people could have died.
• The area known to have been especially badly affected was the coastal city of Tacloban, which is littered with bodies and where the majority of buildings have been destroyed. However, initial reports are emerging of devastation elsewhere on Leyte island, on the northern tip of Cebu, and on Samar.
• Survivors have talked of people being swept away by a huge storm surge. Many thousands are now homeless, with no access to shelter, food or clean water. Some people have taken to ransacking shops and homes in despertation, and the government has considered imposing martial law.
• Aid has begun to arrive, although agencies say the operation has been greatly hampered by blocked roads and ports and airports being out of action. US Marines have been flown from Japan to help with logistics, while David Cameron has pledged £6m of Britih cash and the EU has promised €3m euros.
• The typhoon is making landfall in northern Vietnam. While the winds have weakened somewhat, hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated amid fears the heavy rain could cause landslides.

 5.18pm GMT12:18 

More appalling testimony from the storm surge in Tacloban, as told to Jason Gutierrez of the AFP news agency.

"The huge waves came again and again, flushing us out on the street and washing away our homes," Mirasol Saoyi, 27, told AFP near Tacloban's seaside sports stadium, where thousands of people had gathered after it withstood the typhoon.
"My husband tied us together, but still we got separated among the debris. I saw many people drowning, screaming and going under... I haven't found my husband."

 5.11pm GMT12:11 

The UN's World Food Programme has just posted an update on the situation in the affected areas. Its country director, Praveen Agrawal, said:

The main challenges right now are related to logistics. Roads are blocked, airports are destroyed... WFP is working with the government to set up operational hubs and organise airlifts of essential supplies.

The WFP is seeking to fly food, and logistics and communications equipment to Cebu airport, on the island just west of Leyte, which is being used as a hub. Among equipment due to arrive us 44 tonnes of high energy biscuits, mobile offices and generators and IT equipment.
The agency is already providing food to 173,000 people affected by last month's earthquake on the central island of Bohol, as well as to almost 20,000 people displaced by fighting in Zamboanga, on the conflict-affected southern island of Mindanao.

 4.14pm GMT11:14 

I've put together a story about initial aid efforts, which will be up on the site soon. Here's some of it:

The first shipments of emergency assistance have begun arriving in storm-wrecked regions of the Philippines, with aid agencies warning the extent of the devastation wreaked by typhoon Haiyan have severely hampered the logistics of bringing vital shelter, water and food to the millions affected.
As David Cameron announced £6m in initial British emergency aid, with the EU promising €3m and the US flying in Marines, aid groups said immediate relief efforts would have to be matched by longer-term planning to assist those who had lost crops, fishing fleets and other infrastructure from the near-200mph winds and 6m storm surge.
They also said that while aid groups had some warning of the typhoon’s approach, efforts to get assistance in place in advance had been hampered by the sheer ferocity of one of the strongest storms ever recorded. “In one town where we had made preparations, even the evacuation centre had to be evacuated, as the storm was so strong,” said Ian Bray from Oxfam.
Among the first aid to arrive was 80 US Marines from their base in Okinawa, southern Japan, flown in to help the Philippines army with logistics. The EU later pledged €3m in aid while Cameron promised £6m, also speaking to his Filipino counterpart, Benigno Aquino, to express his condolences.
One significant challenge is that no one as yet knows the precise extent and location of all the devastation. There has been understandable focus on Tacloban, the main city on Leyte island, with some estimates saying up to 10,000 people could have died here alone. However, there has been little word from other, more remote areas in the path of the storm, both on Leyte and also Samar island, to the north-east, and the northern tip of Cebu, to the west.
Bray said Oxfam already had a team elsewhere on Cebu, who had managed to make their way, with great difficulty, to the north. There, the team estimated, 98% of buildings had been damaged. They saw children holding signs, begging for good and water.
Likening the extent of destruction to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Bray said: “Getting up there was really difficult, because the roads are strewn with debris and wreckage. Getting to places for immediate response is going to be a big challenge for everyone, because of the level of destruction.”
There was more to think of beyond shelter, clean water and food, he added: “In the immediate aftermath people need these emergency requirements, but in the medium to long term people’s crops will be affected, and things like fishing equipment. Though there’s obviously a massive immediate need there will also be other needs as well, not just today but in the months to come.”
Pete Garratt, disasters emergency manager for the British Red Cross, said access was extremely tricky: “Our team in Tacloban is saying that moving very far out of Tacloban, or even around parts of it, is hard enough. There’s debris, flooding damage and floodwater, and there are some concerns around the looting. People are desperate for supplies. There are some security concerns.”
He said: “It all makes the logistical element of relief supplies very tricky. We had a lot of stuff in Cebu, and more on its way to Cebu from Manila, and international freight coming in to Manila and Cebu. But it’s onwards from Cebu to the most affected areas that’s going to be the really tricky part of this.”

 3.27pm GMT10:27 

I've been talking to aid agencies about the vast relief effort only just underway, and they stress two things. Firstly, they note that logistics – the sheer task of getting people and aid out to the affected areas – will be extremely difficult given blocked roads and the extreme disruption to ports and airports.
They also say that apart from emergency assistance such as shelter and clean water, people will need much longer-term help, as crops, fishing fleets and other infrastructure has been destroyed.
Then there's the sheer number of people affected. Pete Garratt, disasters emergency manager for British Red Cross said it was lkkely to prove the biggest relief effort since the huge Pakistan floods of 2010, which killed around 2,000 people and affected about 20m.

More on the British aid from a spokesman for Cameron, whose quotes come via the Press Association:

The prime minister [told Aquino] that our thoughts are with all those affected, especially those who have lost loved ones.
This weekend we announced a package of £6m emergency humanitarian support to help more than 500,000 people affected by the storm. 
We have also sent four humanitarian experts to the Philippines to assist three advisers already in the country helping to coordinate the international response.

If the eventual death toll from Haiyan is as large as expected – and there are few immediate reasons to doubt this will be the case – it will be the deadliest storm to hit the Philippines, a nation which suffers not infrequently from extreme weather.
The previously highst death toll was the 5,101 people confirmed to have died when tropical storm Thelma struck, again mainly affecting Leyte island, in November 1991.

 2.17pm GMT09:17 

Oxfam has managed to get a team to the northern tip of Cebu island, directly west of Tacloban and so also in the direct path of the storm. 
In Daanbantayan, in the far north of the island, the aid agency said, "nearly all" buildings are damaged with no electricity. It said:

The team spoke of seeing children begging for help, holding up signs that read, “Help. We need water, food and medicines.”

It was extremely difficult for the team to even reach the area, they reported. Tata Abella-Bolo of Oxfam said:

The scene is one of utter devastation. There is no electricity in the entire area and no water. Local emergency food stocks have been distributed but stocks are dwindling. The immediate need is water, both for drinking and both for cleaning.

 1.42pm GMT08:42 

Jason Gutierrez of the AFP news agency has some more horrific details of the plight faced by survivors in one of the worst-affected areas:

On the outskirts of Tacloban... Edward Gualberto accidentally stepped on bodies as he raided the wreckage of a home.
Wearing nothing but a pair of red basketball trousers, the father-of-four and village councillor apologised for his shabby appearance and for stealing from the dead.
"I am a decent person. But if you have not eaten in three days, you do shameful things to survive," Gualberto told AFP as he dug canned goods from the debris and flies swarmed over the bodies.
"We have no food, we need water and other things to survive."
After half a day's work, he had filled a bag with an assortment of essentials including packs of spaghetti, cans of beer, detergent, soap, canned goods, biscuits and candies.
"This typhoon has stripped us of our dignity... but I still have my family and I am thankful for that."

Kate Hodal has an update on the Haiyan's progress:

The typhoon is now heading towards Vietnam, where the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said Haiyan should be making landfall around the central Quang Binh/Thanh Hoa provinces right about now. Although its force has subsided quite substantially, the rainfall it is expected to bring is enough to cause substantial flooding, and over 600,000 were evacuated in preparation for its arrival.

 1.11pm GMT08:11 

It remains difficult to comprehend the extent of the human tragedy in its totality. Two Reuters reporters in Tacloban have Tacloban have brought together some of the individual stories, which give an indication of the suffering:

One woman, eight months pregnant, describes through tears how her 11 family members vanished in the storm, including two daughters. "I can't think right now," she says. "I am overwhelmed." ... 
Jenny Chu, a medical student and local resident, can't recognise her village. "Everything is gone. Our house is like a skeleton and we are running out of food and water. We are looking for food everywhere." ...
Lieutenant Colonel Fermin Carangan of the Philippine Air Force recalls how he and 41 officers struggled to survive huddled in their airport office as winds approached 195 mph."Suddenly the sea water and the waves destroyed the walls and I saw my men being swept by waters one by one." Two drowned and five are missing. He was swept away from the building and clung to a coconut tree with a seven-year-old boy. "In the next five hours we were in the sea buffeted by wind and strong rain. It was so dark you couldn't see anything. I kept on talking to the boy and giving him a pep talk because the boy was telling me he was tired and he wanted to sleep." He finally saw land and swam with the boy to a beach strewn with dead bodies. "I think the boy saved my life because I found strength so that he can survive."

Kate Hodal in Manila emails to say the EU has announced it will commit €3m for immediate emergency relief in the worst affected areas of the Philippines, and will coordinate relief operations with national and local authorities and humanitarian partners. The US has also reportedly set aside $100,000 for relief supplies and tonight sent some 80 marines from Okinawa to Manila in order to help the Philippines army with logistics.

 12.42pm GMT07:42 

The Disasters Emergency Commitee, the aggregation of 14 aid agencies which makes coordinted appeals for donations in Britain after major disasters, says it is "actively considering" an appeal over Typhoon Haiyan but has yet to decide.
DEC appeals are only made when three criteria are met: if a disaster is of a sufficient scale and urgency; if member charities are in a good position to help; and if it's considered that a specific DEC appeal would raise significant extra funds.
Brendan Paddy from DEC told me the first two criteria were clearly met, but it remained unclear whether charities would see significantly more money coming in from a united appeal than would happen anyway. A lot of this, he said, depended on sustained media coverage, and given the relatively slight cultural and demographic links between the UK and the Philippines this might not be the case here, he noted:

We would need to be sure that the amount of extra time, money and effort needed to make an appeal would generate enough of an extra return to make it worthwhile.

A decision is likely early next week, once DEC staff have liaised with member charities and the broadcasters who show DEC appeals.

The Philippines president, Benigno Aquino, has deployed hundreds of police and soldiders to try and keep order in Tacloban, and is considering a temporary imposition of martial law to prevent more widespread disorder, according to Reuters. It quotes him as saying:

Tonight, a column of armoured vehicles will be arriving in Tacloban to show the government's resolve and to stop this looting.

While the focus remains on Tacloban, some details are coming in of destruction elsewhere in the Philippines. This is an aerial shot of the damage to part of Iloilo, a coastal city on Panay island, a couple of hundred miles further west.
It's worth noting that the great majority of press photos of Tacloban show dead bodies littering the streets, and it's purely an editorial choice not to use them on this blog. You can see a broader range of photos from the AFP news agency, but be aware of the sometimes graphic content. Link here.

 11.24am GMT06:24 

The AFP news agency has perhaps the most through round-up of events in the Philippines, which you can read in full here. This is an excerpt about looting in Tacloban. It's worth noting that if you're taking supplies to keep yourself and your family alive, as seems the case for many, "looting" isn't the best word:

Hundreds of police and soldiers were deployed to contain looters in Tacloban, the devastated provincial capital of Leyte, while the United States announced it had responded to a Philippine government appeal and would send military help.
"Tacloban is totally destroyed. Some people are losing their minds from hunger or from losing their families," high school teacher Andrew Pomeda, 36, told AFP, as he warned of the increasing desperation of survivors.
"People are becoming violent. They are looting business establishments, the malls, just to find food, rice and milk... I am afraid that in one week, people will be killing from hunger."
Authorities were struggling to even understand the sheer magnitude of the disaster, let alone react to it, with the regional police chief for Leyte saying 10,000 people were believed to have died in that province alone.
"We had a meeting last night with the governor and, based on the government's estimates, initially there are 10,000 casualties (dead)," Chief Superintendent Elmer Soria told reporters in Tacloban.

 11.14am GMT06:14 

It's worth reiterating that for all the obvious destructive power of sustained wind speeds of almost 200mph, it was the associated storm surge – the rush of water into coastal areas – which caused the worst damage in Tacloban, and most likely many of the deaths. The storm surge in Tacloban was estimated at 6m, sweeping away even concrete buildings, and bringing the sort of devastation so reminiscent of the Indian Ocean tsunami.

 10.34am GMT05:34 

The UK government has promised immediate aid to the stricken area. Justine Greening, the international development secretary, has activated the so-called rapid response facility, providing humanitarian aid for up to 500,000 people. British advisers are already in the Philippines to work on the distribution of items such as plastic sheeting and household goods.
Greening said:

My thoughts are with the people of the Philippines, in particular those who have lost loved ones. UK support is now underway. Many thousands of people in remote, hard to reach communities have lost their homes and everything they own. They are living in the open and completely exposed to the elements. The absolute priority must be to reach them with shelter and protection as soon as possible.

According to UN figures more than 330,000 people were displaced by the storm, and 4.3m affected by it.

 10.29am GMT05:29 

The immediate focus of reports about the extent of the devastation in the Philippines has been centred around Tacloban, a city of around 200,000 people where some estimates predict 10,000 people could have died alone. The country's interior secretary, Mar Roxas, has seen the city, saying:

All systems, all vestiges of modern living communications, power, water all are down. There is no way to communicate with the people.

However, there was even less news of the destruction on Samar, the island just to the north of Leyte island. Leo Dacaynos of Samar's provincial disaster office was quoted by AP as saying 300 people were confirmed dead in one town alone, with another 2,000 missing, while some towns had yet to be reached by rescuers. There was no mobile phone signal, he added, making communication possible only by radio.

 10.13am GMT05:13 

Reuters, which has a reporter in Tacloban, the capital city of Leyte province, nearly 400 miles south-east of Manila, has some grim early details about the immediate aftermath of the storm, and the sheer scale of the devatation.

Super typhoon Haiyan destroyed about 70 to 80 percent of the area in its path as it tore through Leyte province on Friday, said police chief superintendent Elmer Soria.
As rescue workers struggled to reach ravaged villages along the coast, where the death toll is as yet unknown, survivors foraged for food as supplies dwindled or searched for lost loved ones.
"People are walking like zombies looking for food," said Jenny Chu, a medical student in Leyte. "It's like a movie."
Most of the deaths appear to have been caused by surging sea water strewn with debris that many said resembled a tsunami, levelling houses and drowning hundreds of people in one of the worst natural disasters to hit the typhoon-prone Southeast Asian nation...
"We had a meeting last night with the governor and the other officials. The governor said, based on their estimate, 10,000 died," Soria told Reuters. "The devastation is so big." More than 330,900 people were displaced and 4.3 million "affected" by the typhoon in 36 provinces, the U.N.'s humanitarian agency said, as relief agencies called for food, water and tarpaulins for the homeless.
Witnesses and officials described chaotic scenes in Leyte's capital, Tacloban, a coastal city of 220,000 about 580 km (360 miles) southeast of Manila, with hundreds of bodies piled on the sides of roads and pinned under wrecked houses. The city lies in a cove where the seawater narrows, making it susceptible to storm surges.
The city and nearby villages as far as one kilometre (just over half a mile) from shore were flooded, leaving floating bodies and roads choked with debris from fallen trees, tangled power lines and flattened homes. TV footage showed children clinging to rooftops for their lives.
Many Internet users urged prayers and called for aid for survivors in the largely Roman Catholic nation on social media sites such as Twitter.
"From a helicopter, you can see the extent of devastation. From the shore and moving a kilometre inland, there are no structures standing. It was like a tsunami," said Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas, who had been in Tacloban since before the typhoon struck the city.
"I don't know how to describe what I saw. It's horrific."

 10.05am GMT05:05 

Kate Hodal, who is in Manila, has sent this update, beginning with the first international efforts to help those affected:

Two C-130 planes carrying about 50 US marines will arrive in Manlia on Sunday night to help with the relief effort for the victims of typhoon Haiyan, US Marine Corps official said, with additional forces expected to follow. The marines are expected to help provide logistics and will be sent to locations deemed necessary by the Philippines government, but it is expected they will be deployed to Tacloban first.
At Villamar Air Base in Manila, journalists, desperate relatives and army and police crowded around boxes of supplies waiting to get into relief planes headed for the devastated city of Tacloban. The Philippines army has been sending in supplies and personnel, but the four C-130 planes have so far been able to arrive only during daylight.
The last cargo flight on Sunday left Manila with runway lights, search and rescue teams and body bags, with the destroyed airport in Tacloban reportedly serving as a makeshift morgue.
"We're sending medicine, relief goods, emergency response teams and tents, generators, communications equipment and fuel," said army spokesman Colonel Miguel Okol. "But our priority right now us sending out security – Philippines National Police – to deal with the [reports of] violence."
A battalion, comprising up to 250 police, had been sent to Tacloban, he said.
Orla Fagan of the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it was still too early to judge government estimates of the death toll without access to all regions. The official toll still stood in the hundreds, but the Red Cross and officials on the ground have estimated it could be more 10,000.
"We haven't been out to the west of the Visayas yet so we have no idea what's gone on there," Fagan said. "Tacloban was really badly hit and we could [see] a replicating of that, we just don't know." UN teams had been deployed south and north of Tacloban to assess damage further out, as well as to Ilo Ilo, which was still without food, water or power, Fagan said.
Most of the Philippines army planes had been sent Tacloban, but one was also sent to Roxas.Osprey tilt-rotor planes will also be deployed and sent to areas where it is difficult to land standard aircraft.
Mathias Eick of of the European Commission's office of humanitarian aid said the first emergency decisions were being taken on EU funding and would be announced on Sunday. "Electricity has just come on in some parts of Bohol – which was badly affected by last months earthquake – and hopefully water will follow soon," he said.

Key event

Here are our live updates of events in the Philippines and elsewhere caused by the devastating storm which struck the region of Leyte.
So far 10,000 people are estimated to have died in the Philippines from super typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever recorded, which reportedly destroyed around three-quarters of the area of Leyte province. The extent of the damage and death toll will likely take many days to assess, and could well rise significantly, especially as the still-strong weather system heads across the South China Sea into Vietnam.
