Students from St Margaret's College, Christchurch, on a trek in Nepal. 

 



Canterbury students in Nepal used their earthquake experiences to offer guidance and support to others.Two groups of students, and staff from St Margaret's College were in Nepal for World Challenge - a three-week student-led expedition when the magnitude 7.8 quake struck east of Pokhara.Their plans to return home on April 29 were on hold.READ MORE: * Quake triggers deadly Mt Everest avalanche* Over 1300 people dead after 7.8 magnitude quake * Kiwis caught in quake terror* Google's person finder toolThe 30-strong team were the only New Zealand World Challenge group in the country, alongside two groups from South Africa.St Margaret's College principal Gillian Simpson had been in "constant contact" with them after she was able to make phone contact with the four staff members and 26 students, and confirm they were all "fine" as news broke of the devastating earthquake.

"It was our kids that taught the Nepalese to 'drop, cover and hold'."With road access in and out of Kathmandu affected and airports closed, the students were stranded in Nepal.Simpson was waiting for evacuation details from World Challenge who were working with the New Zealand embassy in Delhi and also the Australian embassy to assess the situation and evacuate the girls."We just have to be patient," said Simpson.One group of thirteen students had been trekking near Pokhara when the earthquake hit. They had made their way out of avalanche territory when it hit.The other group was located 40km from Kathmandu and were working to build a school.Buildings had collapsed at the school and the girls had camped out in a field overnight.While camped under temporary shelters and in open spaces, the Nepalese community had rallied round the high school students."The Nepalese are beautiful. It's one of those humanitarian cases where they support one another."Both groups had "all they needed" in terms of food and water and were being supported by the Nepalese community, said Simpson.Parents were understandably worried, and the group were updating friends and family via text and through a group Facebook page."It has been about communicating exactly what is happening, not just a 'what if'."Simpson expected cell phone communication to become less frequent as batteries died. World Challenge guides would then start using their battery powered av transmitters.
