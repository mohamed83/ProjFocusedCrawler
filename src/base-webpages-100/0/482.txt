How many people are estimated to have been killed?
In the aftermath of a disaster, keeping an accurate death toll is often difficult and not usually a priority for those on the ground. Initial estimates of 10,000 deaths have now been scaled back to 2,500. The Philippines national disaster risk reduction and management council updated its death toll on Wednesday to 2,344 dead, with 79 missing. Other agencies have estimated that 20,000 people are still unaccounted for.

How many people have been displaced?
Around 673,000, according to government estimates. Of these, 286,000 are being housed in more than 900 evacuation centres. Aid workers have struggled to get to victims as the Philippines is made up of more than 7,000 islands. The UN estimates that more than 11 million people may have been affected by the typhoon.

What are the economic costs?
The disaster-modelling firm Kinetic Analysis Corp estimates that the devastation will cost £8bn – £10bn. The typhoon's destruction is likely to wipe out recent economic growth, pushing the 40% of the country's population who live on under £1.25 a day further into poverty.

How much looting and lawlessness has been reported?
With the slow delivery of food aid, hungry and desperate survivors have been looting shops and warehouses. News reports of security forces exchanging gunfire with armed groups emerged on Wednesday, but many ordinary people are simply scavenging for the food and water needed to survive. A spokesman for the Philippine national police special action force said: "There has been looting for the last three days, but the situation has stabilised." Despite this, aid agencies, such as Oxfam, have expressed concerns that their work is being hampered by the lack of law and order.

What help is the Philippines getting from other countries' militaries?
The US has dispatched another 700 troops to join the marines already stationed in Tacloban, the capital of Leyte province, and one of the areas worst hit. The aircraft carrier USS George Washington, carrying 5,000 crew, and its support ships have just arrived. The British destroyer HMS Daring, which has 700 ration packs and can supply 20,000 litres of clean water, is on its way. Japan is sending about 1,000 troops.

What are the health risks facing Filipinos now?
Typhoon survivors now face a real risk of starvation and dehydration if aid does not get to them in time. The geography of the country, with its many remote islands, has hindered aid agencies who have been trying to get medical supplies, machinery and rescue apparatus to devastated areas. Aid workers have now warned that the decomposing bodies remain uncollected, creating further health risks to survivors.

How powerful was the typhoon compared to other storms?
Typhoon Haiyan is thought to be the deadliest typhoon to hit the country since typhoon Thelma killed an estimated 8,000 people in 1991. Haiyan, a category-five super-typhoon, whipped up waves as high as 5 metres (16ft) and, when it made landfall, caused winds of 195mph. The current death toll could easily surpass the 1991 figure once a more reliable count is made.

How many typhoons does the Philippines experience?

Around 20 typhoons are recorded in the seas surrounding the disaster-stricken country every year. As the Philippines faces the western Pacific, it often takes the full force of storms such as Haiyan that make landfall.

How much money have aid efforts raised?
An appeal by UK charities has raised £13m in its first 24 hours. The UK government has pledged to match donations up to a total of £5m, on top of £10m it has already agreed to give. Australia, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, the UAE and the US have together pledged £38m. China, the world's second-largest economy, faced heavy criticism for its initial donation of £40,000. A territorial dispute between China and the Philippines is likely to lie behind Beijing's paltry sum, which is less than even the Swedish furniture chain Ikea has pledged.
