	This CCTV footage shows the terrifying moment a deadly earthquake first struck in Kathmandu on Saturday.
				    															                

	The video, posted to YouTube, shows a domestic garden begin to shake as tremors hit in the Nepal capital.
				    				        				    															                

	Watch the video below.

	The time stamp on the CCTV footage, labelled 'CAM 2', reveals the video was taken on Saturday April 25 at 12.21pm. It initially shows a peaceful garden, undisturbed other than a slight wind.
				    															                

	Suddenly, dogs in the rear of the garden begin to scamper as if startled. Then the ground starts to shake, causing one of the canines to lose his footing, before the animals scatter.
				    															                

	A woman briefly appears in the background before being dragged away as debris begins to smash onto the paved lawn. Shutters slam open and closed as more damaged is caused by the quake.
				    															                

	A man then runs into shot, appearing to be searching for the dogs. Calm then returns to the garden, just 40 seconds after the quake first hit.
				    																								                

	The video then switches to 'CAM 5' and shows walls and trees shaken violently by the force of the tremor.
				    															                

	More than 3,200 people were killed in the disaster - and the death toll continues to rise.

	Watch the video below.
