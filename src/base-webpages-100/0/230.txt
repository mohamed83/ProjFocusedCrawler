Livelihoods


When a disaster strikes, communities whose sources of income have been destroyed urgently need money. Plan provided paid work that benefitted more than 61,000 people as part of the recovery process. This income helped families meet their basic needs and stimulated the local economy, while the work rehabilitated and rebuilt communities. In addition to this, 7,840 most vulnerable families also received unconditional cash transfers.
Over 61,000 people in two provinces benefitted from ‘Cash for Work’ programmes, participating in efforts to clear debris and restore or build community facilities such as latrines and school water, sanitation and hygiene facilities. This also included replanting of damaged mangrove forests and construction of sea walls to protect communities from future storms. In some cases people were also paid an allowance while training and developing new skills in badly needed areas such as disaster-resilient construction techniques
More than 2,500 out-of-school youths were trained in skills that will help them to obtain decent work.
