Relief work can be engrossing. You forget about yourself, especially when you're working in your own country and with your own people. Right now I'm in Cebu as part of World Vision's typhoon Haiyan response team. I came here straight from London, where I was before the storm hit for a meeting, but I live in Koronadal City on the island of Mindanao.
I didn't have time to go home before coming to Cebu, and I don't yet know when I'll go home. My family understands how passionate I am with my work. I've been a relief worker for 15 years, but down here, with things as they are, days go by when we can't communicate because we're just too busy, and the communication lines are problematic.
I often forget about food. In our first distribution in north Cebu, I forgot all about breakfast and I finally got to have lunch at 4pm. But the thing is, I never really feel hungry. And I think the rest of the needs of myself and the team here in Cebu are secondary right now. In previous disasters, we slept on top of tables in a school converted into our relief base.
I've seen that there has been criticism of the speed at which aid has got through to the people affected by the typhoon. Usually, I can make things happen fast. I can get relief trucks rolling in a day. People won't go hungry. It's not that easy here. We go through a local process to assess the situation, draw up a list of beneficiaries, and check it so we can be sure that everyone will get their fair share of the assistance. Then we have to get the goods into the relief packs, which means hundreds or even thousands of local volunteers and staff working on packing for at least 24 hours.
As the packs are ready, we load them on to trucks, and then we've got to get them to the disaster site. This week, one of our aid distributions in Ormoc City was postponed because the boats meant to help in the distribution were late. There's nothing to do but reschedule. And in the case of the Philippines, an archipelago composed of different islands, sometimes, the trucks travel by land navigating damaged and dangerous bridges and roads, before crossing the sea to reach their destination. We had to locate a barge in Cebu City to bring the relief goods to Ormoc City. The process of packing the barge was slowed down by the lack of supplies in the local markets because so much agricultural land was destroyed.
And our volunteers face their own exhaustion. They are just as affected by the damage our transport routes have sustained; it's frustrating for us to be delayed in our work. All of us, workers from foreign parts of World Vision that have come here to help, Filipina like myself, and our many local volunteers, we all risk our lives to find a way.
I honestly don't know how my colleagues assigned to the warehouses, in transport and co-ordination of the delivery of our aid, do it. I see them working 24 hours non-stop to get things done. If there are people who hurt the most when a relief distribution is delayed, I really think it's them. I see it in their weary, sleep-deprived faces.
