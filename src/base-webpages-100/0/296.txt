Typhoon Haiyan: aid convoys come under fire as relief operation becomes 'logistical nightmare'

Gun culture of the Philippines hinders relief efforts

Aid 
  begins to trickle into hard-hit areas


Aid convoys attempting to bring relief to the victims of Typhoon Haiyan are 
  coming under regular attack from both suspected communist rebels and 
  starving survivors of the monster storm. 


Relief columns being escorted by the Philippines 
  army are now engaged in firefights with members of the New People's Army, 
  the militant wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines.

The almost complete breakdown of law and order in the areas hardest-hit by 
  Haiyan is only further hampering a relief operation that the UN's World Food 
  Programme is describing as a "logistical nightmare".

Typhoon Haiyan: 'We are failing thousands of girls at risk of rape'

One column was attacked this morning as it tried to travel across the San 
  Juanico Bridge that links the devastated city of Tacloban with neighbouring 
  Samar Province and was forced to turn back.

Last night, two rebels were killed outside Matnog, a port at the southern tip 
  of Luzon Island, after they attempted to hijack a Red Cross convoy bound for 
  Samar. 


In Alangalang, an area just west of Tacloban, eight people were crushed to 
  death when a wall collapsed after thousands of desperate victims of Haiyan 
  stormed a government rice warehouse. 


More than 100,000 sacks of rice were looted, according to National Food 
  Authority spokesman Rex Estoperez. 






Thousands of people are besieging the overwhelmed airport in Tacloban, where 
  10,000 people alone are believed to have been killed by tsunami-like storm 
  surges, desperate to escape a city where corpses rot in the ruined streets 
  and people scavenge amidst the debris for something to eat. 


Earlier on Wednesday, reports emerged that eight people were crushed to death 
  on Tuesday when a huge crowd of survivors from haiyan rushed a government 
  rice store in Alangalang town, some 10 miles from Tacloban. 






"There is no water, no food," said Joselito Caimoy, one of the lucky 
  few who managed to get his wife, son and daughter onto a flight out of 
  Tacloban. "The malls, the grocery stores have all been looted. They're 
  empty. People are hungry and they (the authorities) cannot control the 
  people," said the 42-year-old truck driver. 


Now, police and soldiers have to hold back the crowds which stampede towards 
  the runway every time a plane lands at Tacloban airport.

  coastal town of Tanawan (AP)


Despite deploying commandos from the elite Special Action Force and imposing a 
  night-time curfew in Tacloban, the authorities are unable to impose order on 
  a city where people are half-crazed by hunger and thirst. 


"The city has been thrown back to the primitive age," said local 
  fire chief Superintendent Rafel Doron. 


Power and communications remain down in many areas. With roads blocked and the 
  small airports in the areas flattened by Haiyan only just opening up, aid 
  agencies are unable to get desperately-needed food and water to the people 
  worst-affected by what may be the strongest storm ever to make landfall.

  plane at Halim Perdana Kusumah Airport in Jakarta, Indonesia (EPA)


Children stand by the side of the few roads open begging for food and water 
  and holding up signs that simply say, 'Help Us'. 


Five days after Haiyan struck, almost half of the 700,000 people left homeless 
  by the storm are still sleeping rough, even as new tropical storms dump yet 
  more rain on the vast swathe of the central Philippines smashed by Haiyan. 


More and more people are falling ill and the prospect of widespread outbreaks 
  of disease is becoming a real fear. 


On Monday, the Philippines justice secretary Leila de Lima dismissed the idea 
  of imposing martial law in places like Tacloban and Guiuan, the port in 
  eastern Samar where Haiyan first made landfall and another town suffering 
  from widespread disorder. 


But with the few aid convoys that are setting out now under fire, she may be 
  forced to re-consider that decision.
