The Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious is being sent to the Philippines to help victims of typhoon Haiyan, David Cameron has announced.
Speaking during a visit to India, the prime minister said the ship would replace HMS Daring, which has already been deployed to the Philippines.
Its helicopters may be used to assist with the distribution of food and water to survivors stranded in remote locations in the far eastern archipelago state, and its facilities to make water drinkable are likely to be in demand in a country where supplies have been badly disrupted by the typhoon.
The Ministry of Defence said Illustrious, which has been taking part in war-game operations, should arrive in the Philippines on 24 or 25 November, with 900 crew and seven helicopters on board.
Cameron said: "What's happened in the Philippines is an absolute tragedy. You can see the devastation, the suffering and it's quite clear that we are going to need long-term help for those people.
"As ever, the British people have been very generous with their donations. The British government has pledged over £20m, which makes us one of the most generous donors anywhere in the world. But it's practical action that's needed as well.
"That's why I sent HMS Daring to go and help in the Philippines. And I can announce today that once Daring has started its work, we are actually going to be able to replace in time HMS Daring with HMS Illustrious which is of course a carrier with helicopters, seven times as many helicopters as on HMS Daring and with the key ability to process fresh water. So we will be giving further assistance in the best way we can."
The MoD was unable to confirm the current location of Illustrious but the Royal Navy reported the warship was in Muscat, Oman, on 12 November.
HMS Illustrious, Britain's sole remaining aircraft carrier, will retire from active duty next year.
The news came as the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) announced that its Philippines typhoon appeal had raised more than £23m in just two days.
The funds, made up of online, text and phone donations, will go directly to help some of the 11 million people affected by typhoon Haiyan.
The money raised will be used to deliver food, water, household items and tarpaulin for shelter to people who have had their homes damaged or destroyed and are in desperate need of food, water and shelter.
The DEC said the response was overwhelming.
Saleh Saeed, the DEC chief executive, said: "The public's reaction to the sheer devastation that has been left by typhoon Haiyan is quite simply remarkable. We are so grateful for the huge amount of donations which are vital to fund the work done by our emergency teams.
"This has already become one of our most generously supported appeals but there is still a huge humanitarian need for help. Our priority is to provide food, water and shelter to those affected. Money raised will go directly to delivering these essentials and it's important we continue to provide this support."
