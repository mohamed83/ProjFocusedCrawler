Why aid workers face challenges crossing the Philippines

26 November 2013: The Philippines is an archipelago, some 2,000 inhabited islands scattered like petals upon the ocean. Getting around it is not easy at the best of times. There is dense forest, hills and mountains, roads of varying quality, a voracious rainy season bringing with it flash floods and treacherous landslides.
Throw into the mix a super typhoon, reportedly one of the biggest on record, wreaking havoc with power, telecommunications, roads, fuel, security and life in general – and it soon becomes apparent why getting information out and aid into the country was proving so difficult.
Planes, a ferry, cars...
My journey into East Samar from the capital Manila had been tricky enough – a 2-day slog consisting of a flight, a drive, a ferry journey, another drive, an overnight stop and another car journey.
Getting back to Manila a week later, would prove no less eventful. My little video blog shows just one small example of how things are not always as straightforward as you think from the outside.
