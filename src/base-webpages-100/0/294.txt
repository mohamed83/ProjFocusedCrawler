The first signs of a concerted aid effort appeared in typhoon-ravaged Tacloban on Wednesday as US military planes delivered 25 tonnes of biscuits to starving survivors on the same day the city's mayor implored residents to leave town in order to survive.
The mayor's grim suggestion followed the death of eight people who were crushed after thousands of hungry residents stormed a government-owned rice warehouse in desperate search of food.
It has been five days since the strongest storm ever recorded pummelled its way across the central Philippines, leaving in its wake a mess of death and destruction. The lack of food and water in the region has triggered looting of shops and malls for supplies, with reports circulating of gunshots and stabbings and one Philippine Red Cross convoy allegedly hijacked by armed men who were shot dead by police.
In Tacloban, the capital of Leyte province, decaying bodies still line the streets and looters have taken to pillaging the city's few remaining drops of fuel. Food and drug warehouses have also been stormed.
The United Nations World Food Programme said on Thursday that nearly 50,000 people in and around Tacloban had received rice and canned food. Each three-kilogram pack was enough to feed a family for a few days. Nearly 25 tonnes of high-energy biscuits were either on their way by plane or already being distributed.
Only about 20% of Tacloban's 220,000 residents had so far received aid, city administrator Tecson John Lim pointed out to Reuters. Some had been forced to dig up water pipes in order to stay alive. "Looting is not criminality – it is self-preservation," said Lim.

Mayor Alfred Romualdez said his city was in desperate need not only of aid, but also of trucks and drivers to transport it where it is most needed.
Heavy machinery would also help remove the rubble and allow the city to start cleaning up the decaying corpses that line its streets, he said, but he was facing an acute lack of manpower. "I have to decide at every meeting which is more important – relief goods or picking up cadavers," he said.
The Philippine energy secretary, Jericho Petilla, estimated it could take six weeks for the first of the typhoon-hit communities to get their electricity back. 
Petilla said many powerlines and power plants had been damaged, and in places like Tacloban the lack of law and order was making this task very difficult. One example involved troops exchanging fire with a one group of armed men to chase them away from an electricity substation in Leyte province.
The Philippine government has come under fire for failing to deliver aid quickly enough or in sufficient quantity, with frustration in the hardest-hit areas, such as Tacloban, reaching boiling point.
More than 10,000 people are feared to have died during or after Haiyan, which decimated large swaths of the Philippines before killing others in Vietnam and China. Although government figures put the death toll at 2,275, 29 municipalities had not yet been reached on Wednesday and aid workers believe the number of both dead and missing will rise.
"The numbers are just coming in," said Gwendolyn Pang of the Philippine Red Cross. "Many areas we cannot access."

While much of the focus may still be on Tacloban and its immediate surroundings, many of the outlying islands in the archipelago could be in similarly dire straits, relief agencies said.
The UN believes more than 670,000 people have been displaced and a total of 11.3 million people directly affected by the storm. Some $25m (£15.7m) in emergency funds have been set aside for shelter materials and household items, as well as assistance with emergency health services, safe water supplies and sanitation.
Medical teams from Belgium, Israel, Norway and Japan are expected to begin setting up much-needed field hospitals soon, while a team of British medical experts departed for the region.
Food aid includes another 10 tonnes of high-energy World Food Programme biscuits for immediate delivery, with six more military C-130 planes scheduled to deliver aid on Thursday, a military official told the Guardian.
Senior Obama administration officials said on Wednesday that the US government has provided $20m in humanitarian assistance to date. These funds were split between general relief efforts through the US Agency for International Development and food aid provided in partnership with the World Food Programme. Officials said that the US government was set to have more than 1,000 personnel providing assistance in the affected areas by the end of the week. 
On Tuesday, the UN aid chief, Valerie Amos, launched an appeal for $300m. She spent Wednesday in Tacloban, meeting officials, talking to survivors and surveying the number of dead, said Orla Fagan of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA).

The fact that many aid workers have arrived in Tacloban but little aid has yet been disseminated has created a security concern, one aid worker said. A memo was circulating among relief workers advising aid workers not to move around in Tacloban, as some UN staff had already been pulled out for security reasons.
Although international aid has been ready for delivery since shortly after the typhoon hit, it has not yet reached those who need it, said Alwynn Javier of Christian Aid. "Only the government and Philippine Red Cross have been able to do distribution so far as I know," he said. "But it seems access may have improved a bit now, with boats leaving from Samar to Tacloban, and from the southern parts of the island, so we're hoping in the next few days the situation will get better.
"The security still needs to be taken care of because until it is, the aid will remain difficult to distribute."
While the World Food Programme was able to distribute rice to nearly 50,000 people in Tacloban on Wednesday, the agency said in its Twitter feed that the challenge was now "getting food from Manila to the people who need it most".
"The logistical challenges are still enormous given the scale of the disaster," said Alvaro Villanueva, of Action Against Hunger. "Access to the worst-affected areas is extremely difficult given the extent of the damage and the geography."
At a supermarket near Cebu airport, where much of the aid destined for Tacloban is loaded on to cargo planes, one citizen was taking matters into his own hands.
Mark Pinatola stood in front of boxes of noodles, sardines, crisps and toiletries for delivery to Guiuan, the city where Haiyan made landfall on Friday, giving orders to supermarket staff about how to pack supplies for air delivery. "I wanted to deliver it to Tacloban, but the situation there is too dangerous," said the Melbourne-based logistics officer, who has chartered a private helicopter and plans to deliver 800kg worth of aid out of his own pocket. "So I called the mayor of Guiuan and he assured me that it was safe for us to land."
