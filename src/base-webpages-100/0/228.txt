Health
Plan has supported more than 32,800 people to receive critical medical care through ‘one-stop-shop’ mobile health clinics and construction of new permanent, disaster-resilient health clinics. This has included medical missions to hard-to-reach and remote island communities, and training of health providers to ensure that typhoon-affected communities receive quality care.

Nutrition
 From the earliest days of the response, Plan worked around the clock to get emergency food supplies to more than 1.5 million typhoon-affected people. As communities began to recover we focused on ensuring that children and mothers at risk of malnutrition were screened and supported in a region where malnutrition levels were high even before the typhoon.
1.5 million people received emergency food distributions
17 Therapeutic Feeding Centres were established to treat severely malnourished children and screen children and mothers for malnutrition. 3,702 children under 5 years of age and 1,045 pregnant and lactating mothers were screened and assisted on an ongoing basis
1,921 pregnant and lactating mothers received advice and support on infant and young child feeding practices
