Nearly 10,000 people are feared dead and at least 660,000 people have been displaced following last week’s Typhoon Haiyan. The UN says more than 9.8 million people nationwide were affected by the powerful storm, and at least 23,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed. Aid crews are struggling to reach survivors and the following relief organizations are providing immediate assistance:
