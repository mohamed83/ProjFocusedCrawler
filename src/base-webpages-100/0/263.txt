A soldier assists a young girl as villagers are evacuated to safety by a military truck in preparation for the arrival of the super typhoon Haiyan, in the central province of Quang Nam on November 9, 2013.

Powerful typhoon slams Philippines

                                            One of the most powerful storms on record triggered flash floods and landslides
                                    

Officials fear there are thousands of dead in the Philippines, and some expect that millions will need basic aid during the still-unfolding rescue and recovery process, to say nothing of the billions of dollars in damage to homes and infrastructure.

Below is a list of some of the organizations that will be assisting in the recovery effort, with links to their sites to explore how they will be assisting, as well as opportunities for you to assist.
Before you donate either your time or money, please be aware that there are always scammers looking to profit on disasters. If you find an organization you are thinking of giving money to, check their credentials at the Charity Navigator (http://www.charitynavigator.org/), which evaluates the financial health and efficiency of more than 5,500 organizations, or at GuideStar (www.guidestar.org), which gathers and disseminates information about every single IRS-registered nonprofit organization.
