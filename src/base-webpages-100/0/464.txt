Footage from Cebu City

Gladys Gil Areopagita in Cebu filmed waves at the fisherman's port in the aftermath of the typhoon.
Speaking to the Guardian she said:
"When the storm was here in Cebu, the wind was very strong. Steel roofs were ripped off from houses and establishments, trees fell down, glass walls shattered. There was a power outage. But the good thing is that everyone was prepared for it, offices even malls were closed so everyone took refuge indoors. The waves in the video were just the aftermath, when the eye of the typhoon left Cebu."

Communication problems

Communication problems are posing some of the biggest difficulties to relief agency, Manila journalist Sunshine de Leon reports.
Emailing from a Red Cross press conference in the capital she writes:

Leyte appears to be the hardest hit area, with power and phone lines down. Telecommunication companies are attempting to fix them now. Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon said making contact with the area was his biggest frustration.
"There is no communication," he said. "The local Red Cross chapter is working in the area but we don't know what to send them. We need to make sure they are safe, and that they assess the situation so we can send what they need whether its first aid, medical or heavy equipment."
Gordon added: "We see lots of damage on the street - fallen trees, fallend power lines, and houses blown away. I imagine reports of the damage will grow exponentially. The force of flood water and winds took out several weak bridges.

 1.40pm GMT08:40 

Around 12 airports have been closed – including those in the tourist islands of Palawan and Boracay – and schools and offices shut, with roughly 1 million people in shelters scattered around 29 provinces, the Guardian's south east Asian correspondent Kate Hodal reports from Bangkok.

President Benigno Aquino III said three cargo planes, 20 navy ships and 32 military planes and helicopters were on standby for rescue operations and to provide relief. "No typhoon can bring Filipinos to their knees if we'll be united," he said in a televised address

Kate spoke to Mathias Eick of the European Commission's humanitarian aid department who is Manilla. He said the final death toll is expected to climb much higher as many of the areas so far damaged are inaccessible to aid or communication.

"It could take a few hours for the authorities to get to villages and communities in the more rural and isolated areas, and there could be such damage that we fear heavy losses," Eick added.
While Haiyan will not hit Mania directly, the capital has been put on low-level alert, with a "very heavy rain" expected around 6pm, said Eick.
"People have been allowed to go home early from their offices and have been stocking up on food, because they're afraid this rain will lead to flooding," he added.
Experts believe most of the damage to come from the typhoon's resulting storm surge.

UN response

The UN and other relief agencies are preparing to send emergency teams to assess the damage from Typhoon Haiyan, which has forced more than a million people to flee from coastal and low-lying areas in the Philippines, writes Mark Tran, the Guardian global development correspondent.

Haiyan (or Yolanda as it is called in the Philippines) is the third major disaster to hit the country in the past two months. Some 75,000 people are currently living in displacement centres in the southern port of Zamboanga, while 350,000 people are living in tents and other temporary shelters on Bohol after an earthquake that killed 200, close to where Haiyan made landfall early Friday local time.“This is a trifecta of disasters,” said Leonard Doyle, head of online communications at the UN’s International Organisation of Migration in Manila. “There has been the rebellion in Zamboanga, there was the earthquake in Bohol. Now we have a typhoon on top of that. We have no idea of the consequences yet, but it’s going to be devastating by the time the dust settles.”

Legazpi, Albay province

Randall Lorayes in Legazpi the captial of Albay province describes what happened when the storm hit.
Speaking to the Guardian he said:

In the immediate aftermath in the city's boulevard debris was scattered everywhere from the coconut trees and some trash that was flying around with the wind. Structural damage at a local mall where part of the wall was peeled off due to the strong winds and gusts. Even though Legazpi was not in the direct path of Haiyan, it still had a significant impact because of the huge diameter of the storm.
Local authorities were non-stop with giving updates as well enforcing evacuation orders in areas where it was at high risk of flooding and landslide. It was clear that they were going for a zero casualty goal. I got the news of the storm just 48 hours before landfall, there was enough time to prepare by keeping phones charged, fortifying the house, securing important things in case of floods, and stocking up on food and water. The President of the Philippines himself appeared on national TV to inform everyone of the impending danger brought by the storm.
I haven't heard much from where the storm had a direct hit though such as Tacloban and Ormoc. The situation over there is far worse than here in Legazpi. People have returned to their homes and authorities are checking the electricity lines before restoring power once again."

 11.47am GMT06:47 

Simon Redfern, professor of Earth Sciences at University of Cambridge, confirms that Haiyan is the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall.
Writing in the Conversation he tracks the history of big tropical storms, and discusses whether climate change makes such extreme weather more likely.

With sustained winds of more than 310 km/h, or 195 mph, as it approached the Philippines, Super Typhoon Haiyan has hit land in the past few hours with terrifying force. This makes it the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in history.
Haiyan was earlier reported to be the most intense tropical storm in this area since Super Typhoon Tip (1979), and may even have exceeded the force of Tip. It had already been recognised to be one of the four most intense storms on modern record.
Preliminary satellite estimates of the central pressure at the eye of the storm have been reported at around 860 mbar, which if confirmed would make Haiyan the strongest storm ever recorded. Its intensity is recorded as Category 5 (maximum) on the scale for tropical storms and 8.0 (maximum) on the Dvorak scale of intensity.
The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports:
"The intensification of Super Typhoon Haiyan is being fuelled by “ideal” environmental conditions – namely low wind shear and warm ocean temperatures. Maximum sustained winds are currently at 195 mph, well above the Category 5 classification used for Atlantic and East Pacific hurricanes."
Tropical storms such as Haiyan are known as typhoons in the Pacific, but are the same as the storms labelled hurricanes or cyclones elsewhere. Haiyan is the strongest tropical storm since Hurricane Allen (1980) which hit the Caribbean. It appears to have surpassed Hurricane Camille (1969) in making landfall with wind speeds at Category 5 level.
Already, the reasons for such extreme weather are being scrutinised. The surface water, as well as deeper water, temperatures of the Western Pacific have provided huge amounts of energy for the storm to absorb, fuelling Haiyan’s intensification.
Along with devastating storms, the typhoon will bring a deluge of rain and storm surge, threatening coastal areas of the Philippines with flood and destruction. As the storm progresses across the islands it is expected to weaken and dissipate, tracking towards Vietnam.
The recent IPCC report on climate change highlighted the risks associated with changes in the patterns and frequency of extreme weather events. While individual storms such as Haiyan cannot be directly attributed to such changes, the statistics of such storms will help build a picture of how climate change is affecting the planet. Climatologists are keen to develop models that provide accurate risk factors for tropical cyclones.
As the planet and particularly the oceans heat, simple physics indicates that the energy stored is likely to increase the intensity and frequency of devastating storms like Haiyan, at great cost to coastal communities.

Summary

Catastrophic damage is feared in the Philippines after the islands were battered by winds of up to 195mph from Typhoon Haiyan - claimed to be the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in recorded history.
Here's a roundup of the latest developments:
• Three people have killed and seven injured, according to the Philippines national disaster agency. Relief agencies fear that death toll will increase. Anna Lindenfors, Save the Children country director for Philippines, said: "We expect the level of destruction caused by Typhoon Haiyan to be extensive and devastating, and sadly we fear that many lives will be lost. As the storm batters across the country, homes, schools and offices are being destroyed by the record-breaking winds. The storm surge is causing widespread flooding." 
• Power and communications in the three large island provinces of Samar, Leyte and Bohol were almost completely down, according to Reuters.
• The storm is now heading for Vietnam, according to the storm tracking site Cyclonane. 
• Haiyan is the strongest tropical cyclone on record to make landfall, according to Jeff Masters, director of meteorology, at Weather Underground.
