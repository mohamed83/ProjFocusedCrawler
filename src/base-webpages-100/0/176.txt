Philippines: Dynamic Recovery Underway 10 Months After Typhoon Haiyan

Recovery is moving forward dynamically in the Philippines, 10 months after Super Typhoon Haiyan claimed 6,201 lives and damaged or destroyed 1.1 million homes across the islands of Samar and Leyte. CRS has been working closely with Church partners and collaborating with communities to rebuild homes, livelihoods and stability.
In the first months of the emergency response, CRS supported 40,000 families—200,000 people—with emergency shelter, clean water and sanitation. This has included: materials for 42,921 emergency shelters; 35,620 water, sanitation and hygiene kits; water taps and bladders for 13,120 people; and cash-for-work activities removing 3,991 tons of debris.
CRS has now moved well into the transitional phase (years 1 and 2) of this 5-year recovery effort, and is focused primarily on shelter (including water and sanitation) and livelihoods.
CRS provides a menu of options for shelter, resettlement and restoring livelihoods. Communities play a key role in determining their needs, which vary by locality. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.
As of September, 2,208 homes have been completed and 4,213 are under construction. CRS will be helping 17,000 families rebuild their homes. We’re training and supplying carpenters with tools to build homes using more durable, disaster-resistant materials. Shelter design and building will incorporate water pipes and other infrastructure to ensure homes and communities have clean water and sanitation.
In terms of livelihoods, we have helped families strengthen and stabilize their incomes. CRS teams are working with communities to restore their assets and diversify their work options by offering training in agricultural production and marketing. To date, CRS has helped 9,000 families get back to work with cash assistance and technical support for their choice of working in agriculture, livestock production, fishery and aquaculture, gardening, or training in small businesses.
For improving water, sanitation and hygiene, which is part of the shelter programming, CRS teams are piloting the construction of complex latrine models that are suitable for locations with high water tables. Palo engineers are testing water levels in each zone and sampling soil. To date, CRS has supported communities to build or repair 2,832 household latrines (another 3,026 are under construction), install 117 hand pumps and build hand-washing stations at 29 schools. CRS also trained 34,861 people in hygiene promotion.
All of CRS’ Haiyan emergency efforts are focused in Palo, Tacloban, Ormoc and Eastern Samar.
