Typhoon Haiyan: fears not all survivors have been reached









UN concerned aid has not reached remote areas as Philippines president says he has been 'tempted to despair'

The president of the Philippines has said the scale of suffering left by typhoon Haiyan has "tempted him to despair", as the UN expressed concern that remote areas had not been reached.
More than 3,900 people were killed by fierce gales and a massive storm surge, and officials estimate that 4 million have been displaced.
A growing number of residents have been able to leave the disaster zone, deliveries of aid have become more regular and in some places markets and petrol stations have reopened.
Speaking as he visited Palo, south of the worst-hit city of Tacloban, Benigno Aquino told reporters: "One is tempted to despair, but the minute I despair, then everybody, it cascades down and everybody gets hampered in their efforts."
Bernard Kerblat, the UN high commissioner for refugees representative for the Philippines, warned: "As of now, personally, I am not so sure that we've reached every single portion of the territory where people are in need of aid."
With attention turning to recovery as well as relief efforts, the country's energy secretary said he was willing to resign if he failed to restore power by 24 December. "It's difficult to celebrate Christmas without light," Jericho Petilla said. One hundred and sixty giant power transmission towers and thousands of posts were blown over by the typhoon.
He told Reuters that engineers in Palo had managed to salvage some generators and said he hoped to have 3km-4km of street lights functioning, along with the municipal hall, to give hope to residents.
The World Bank has also promised to extend a $500m (£310m) emergency loan to support the reconstruction of buildings capable of withstanding severe floods and winds of up to 280kph.
But the Philippines' budget secretary, Florencio Abad, said the cost of rebuilding "will be much more than the $500m, even [with] the additional $500m that the ADB [Asian Development Bank] is also promising to provide us".
There is also concern that that corruption -– widespread in the country – could lead to donations being siphoned off. Aquino's government, which has vowed to fight corruption, has promised transparency in reconstruction spending.
"There's an urgent call now for us to monitor the movement of foreign aid funds for [the typhoon] so they will go exactly where they're supposed to: to the survivors," Richard Moya, the budget undersecretary and chief information officer, said in a statement, announcing the creation of a website to facilitate such scrutiny.
The Philippines government said more than $270m in foreign aid has been pledged –although Action Against Hunger warned this weekend that promised donations often fail to materialise after natural disasters.
The latest global report from anti-corruption group Transparency International found the Philippines was one of only 11 countries in which people said they were noticing an improvement in corruption levels.
