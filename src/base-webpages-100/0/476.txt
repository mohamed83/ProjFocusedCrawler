Typhoon Haiyan stirs memories of the struggles under the Marcos regime and a global image problem

For a short spell in the mid-80s I was the Guardian's political correspondent in the Philippines during the campaign to oust its dictatorial president, Ferdinand Marcos, whose hand I avoided shaking at a press conference in Manila's Malacañang Palace before his eventual fall. This often-unlucky society has been in my thoughts as typhoon Haiyan wreaked its havoc.
As countries go, the Philippines has an image problem abroad, many popular connotations being negative, a victim of assorted imperialist ambitions – Spanish, American, Japanese – and of natural disasters, earthquakes and volcanoes, hurricanes and tropical floods. All too often the word Filipino conjures up ideas of domestic service and subservience in distant lands.
Yet the Filipinos I met during two stints there in 1986 were both friendly and brave. Digging through the cuttings I found an article I wrote quoting a Manila intellectual saying: "What I find inspiring in this country is the loss of fear." That's a familiar remark, isn't it? From Romania and Poland to Egypt and Libya when people decide they've had enough is moment when tyrants are toppled.
The Philippines are actually huge. An archipelago of 7,000 hot and mostly lush tropical islands east of the South China Sea, its population is now 98 million – at least a third bigger than in 1986 – and its current growth rate 6%. After reconquest and independence from the US in 1946 it was expected to become one of the early "Asian miracle" countries, but stalled under the Marcos kleptocracy, which began in 1965.
So the last 25 years have been better, albeit patchily, first under the late Corazon "Cory" Aquino, the gentle, amateur politician and revered "mother of democracy" whose son "NoyNoy" Aquino is currently the Philippine president struggling to cope with the latest natural disaster – and not doing very well. In the dynastic politics of Asia it was the regime's murder of Cory's husband, then opposition leader, Benigno Aquino Jnr, at Manila airport (now named after him) on return from self-imposed exile in 1983 that started the chain of events which toppled Marcos.
In the month I spent there in the runup to the 1986 elections, which Marcos conceded but then attempted to steal from Cory Aquino, I travelled extensively. In the north of Luzon, the main island, I visited Marcos's native village in Ilocos – with its well-paved roads and poshed-up birthplace (even the family well was on the first floor!). A man was painting a huge "Congratulation your Victory, President Marcos" banner, which was tactless the day before polling day. In the remote southern island of Mindanao (the world's deepest ocean floor takes its name from it), which is Muslim – the two great evangelising faiths clashed in the Philippines and Christianity won – I saw grim poverty which fuelled an insurrection never quite extinguished.
I didn't visit storm-struck Cebu, but did inspect vast sugar cane plantations on nearby Negros (11 March 1986) where families were struggling on 50p a day, not enough to buy the 3kg of rice six people need to get by without the salt and fish that augments it. Some talked of bloody revolution if Aquino's promised reforms did not deliver a better life. Many remain poor and disappointed, but it has not happened.

US forces have withdrawn from their two great bases at Clark and Subic Bay, corruption is said to be less, but still very present. Some 11 million Filipinos live and work abroad, their remittances an important part of the economy. In Hong Kong on a Sunday night one could – perhaps still can – here the high-pitched chatter of Filipino houseworkers enjoying their evening off with street picnics and gossip. "My mother looks after my children at home, as I will look after their children one day," one told me with simplicity and sadness.
There are 170 languages used in the Philippines (Tagalog the chief one), but none of them is Spanish, a surprise when I naively arrived there. "Four hundred years in a monastery, then 100 years in Hollywood," is how Filipinos described their "liberation" from Spain in 1898, the Spanish-American war whipped up by New York tabloids and immortalised in Citizen Kane. Catholicism, as practised by 90% of Filipinos, is Spain's chief legacy. But the elite's shared language is English.
It was the church's turning away from Marcos – later followed by opportunist generals and plutocrats from his crony capitalism – which finished him off. The splendidly named Cardinal Sin was a powerful voice for reform as the wind blew even the pro-crony Reagan administration into opposition. That and people power. From the roof of the Manila hotel – great colonial relic – I counted the vast protest demo below and (by breaking up the crowd into equal squares) reckoned it was close to the 1 million that the opposition claimed. Too big to break up except at great cost.
Marcos had been convicted of a political murder in his youth (overturned on appeal), but his regime was primarily a greedy one rather than bloodthirsty. He and his wife Imelda salted away billions which they never got to spend after being hustled out of the Malacañang at night by US forces and into exile in Hawaii. "Guns, goons and gold" was another slogan of the times and villagers (the flicker of TV sets inside thatched huts was a novelty to me) were clearly vulnerable to threats. Simon Winchester, Guardian turned Sunday Times, and I smuggled a man out of a village in our car boot to escape them.
I never got to hear Ferdinand and Imelda sing together, a favourite routine, though I waited with a vast crowd near one of Manila's famous rubbish tips and heard an evidently poor man assure me that, whatever Marcos's faults "our peso is stronger than the Mexican peseta" – a Thatcherite at heart. The couple did not arrive until 2am. After I had left. Nor did I see Imelda's 600 pairs of shoes when I returned to the Philippines on the night of Marcos's flight. As I struggled through the crowd towards the fallen Malacañang I felt my wallet disappear into the clutches of nimble fingers: that setback took most of the day.
But I remember the colourfully painted, scary taxis, "Jeepneys" after second world war US army jeeps, with affection, the cock-fighting and the smells less so. One morning Winchester – now a successful author -– swung by a downtown McDonald's (it had an evil drain outside) to pick up burgers for breakfast on the road. Being one of nature's democrats he offered a piece to our driver. "I will take it home to share with my family," he said of this exotic and expensive novelty.
And I will always be grateful for the political insight offered by an old man in central Luzon who stood on his head to prove to me he was very much alive and well. "I helped elect Marcos in the old days," he said before explaining all the reasons why it had gone wrong. Would Marcos steal the coming election, I asked? "He'll try," was the drift of his reply. "He won't succeed this time. They can burn down one town hall, but they can't burn down them all."
And so it proved to be – as it so often does when people power moves, though it often takes a lot longer than the few weeks it took between fraud and flight in 1986. Neither guns, goons nor even gold (the Fleet Street variety included) can hold out forever. No one can burn down all the town halls and keep on burning them.
