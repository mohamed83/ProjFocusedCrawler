A typhoon believed to be the strongest storm to hit southern China in four decades has killed 17 people after claiming 94 lives in the Philippines, officials said.
Typhoon Rammasun killed nine people and left five missing after hitting Hainan island on Friday off China's southern coast, said an official at the ministry of water resources' flood control department said.
Eight others died later in the Guangxi region as the storm ploughed into the mainland on its way south to Vietnam.
The typhoon is the strongest to hit southern China in 41 years, according to the China Meteorological Administration. Wind speeds reached 216kmh (130 miles per hour), with the storm knocking down power lines and damaging buildings, Xinhua news agency said.
Authorities in southern China ordered the highest level of alert and suspended hundreds of buses, trains and flights across the region.
The typhoon had wreaked havoc earlier in the week in the northern Philippines, leaving 94 people dead.
The death toll added to a bleak weekend for China as on Saturday a truck loaded with flammable liquid collided with a bus on a highway in the south of the country, killing at least 43 people. Xinhua said the truck collided with the bus around 3am on the Hukun Expressway in Hunan province, with the truck's driver and passenger among the dead. Five people were also injured.
• This article was amended on 22 July 2014. An earlier version placed Vietnam north of Guangxi.
