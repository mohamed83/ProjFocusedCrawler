HSBC has announced a $1m (£630,000) cash donation to the relief effort in the Philippines, making it the biggest UK business donor recorded so far to the typhoon-stricken nation.
The bank, which made pre-tax profit of $20.6bn (£12.9bn) last year, paid the money to the Philippine Red Cross. Its Philippines business donated another $23,000 (£14,500) and employees had raised more than $60,000 (£37,700) in the past two days, HSBC added.
HSBC's chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said: "We hope our donation and the efforts of our staff will go some small way to making a difference to the communities that now urgently need help."
Other British companies with businesses in the Philippines have pledged support but stopped short of unconditional cash donations.
Standard Chartered, HSBC's big banking rival in Asia, said it would match donations made by its employees. When the Asian tsunami devastated the region in 2004, the bank announced $5m (£3.1m) of donations to relief agencies.
The insurer Prudential, which makes most of its profit in Asia, said it was already working with Save the Children and Plan International on disaster preparation in the Philippines before typhoon Haiyan struck last weekend. It, too, said it would match donations from employees.
Sue Adkins, international director at Business in the Community, said the tsunami and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti had made companies more ready to respond to disasters.
"It used to be hard to get companies to talk about what they were doing because they hadn't sorted it out. They are working so much faster and have prepared themselves to take action.
She said companies without Philippines operations offering help included BT, which is giving satellite communication support to aid agencies.
Richard Ellis, director of corporate and social responsibility at Alliance Boots, said it provided medical supplies to relief agency International Health Partners each year. He said the aid organisation had given it "a pretty big list" of extra items needed in the Philippines that the pharmacy group, which has no business in the Philippines, was trying to supply.
Adkins said: "A lot of companies are clear that even if they don't do business in a country where disaster has struck they are still expected to help by their employees and clients. The speed seems to be faster this time and unfortunately that's because it has happened before."
