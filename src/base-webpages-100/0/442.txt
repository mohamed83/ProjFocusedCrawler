See the interactive appeal map
Typhoon Haiyan tore a path of destruction over 100 miles wide through the central Philippines after making landfall early in the morning on the 8th of November local time. It brought torrential rain, winds of over 170mph and a storm surge of up to 25 feet that devastated coastal areas.
 
Over 14 million people where affected, including five million who have seen their homes damaged or destroyed. Over 6000 people lost their lives. 
 
Donations from the UK public for the appeal raised £95 million and to date have helped over 900,000 people. DEC fundraising for this appeal is now closed; money raised for the appeal will be spent over the two year period ending in November 2016 and will help people affected by Haiyan recover and rebuild their lives. To support our member agencies ongoing work, please visit them via their websites.
