Aid to the Philippines: who is giving what?
Since Typhoon Haiyan wreaked destruction across the Philippines, enormous sums of money have been donated by private and governmental organisations - over £240bn. But who has pledged these sums and how much of it has actually been delivered? We used the United Nations Financial Tracking Service to produce this interactive with all the facts. You can select specific donors (from the Holy See to the Ikea foundation) using the drop-down list on the left. Then, you can select specific channels to see whether the money has been earmarked for a specific project. The UK tops the list in terms of overall money, although there's a big difference between pledges (a non-binding announcement of an intended contribution) and funding (received payments plus legal commitments).
