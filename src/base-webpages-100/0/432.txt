• Twitter list: the US aid effort 
The US government has joined nations around the world in pledging assistance to storm-devastated regions of the Philippines, where as many as 600,000 people have been displaced by Typhoon Haiyan. 
Here is a look at the agencies involved in the relief effort: 
US military
As the storm bore down on Friday, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel directed the military's Pacific Command to deploy ships and aircraft to the Philippines. An advance team of 90 sailors and marines normally stationed on Okinawa arrived on Sunday. They are distributing food, water and generators.
The initial effort focuses on search and rescue, helicopter lift support and logistic teams. C-130 cargo airplanes, MV-22 Osprey helicopters and other aircraft will be used for searching the sea for survivors, as well as delivering supplies.
Two of the marine C-130s arrived in Tacloban on Monday and were unloading emergency items in the coastal city, where virtually every building was destroyed by the typhoon's huge storm surge.

US marine Brigadier General Paul Kennedy took a helicopter flight over Tacloban, and described what he saw to the Associated Press: "I don't believe there is a single structure that is not destroyed or severely damaged in some way — every single building, every single house". He spoke on the tarmac at the airport, where two Marine C-130 cargo planes were parked, engines running, unloading supplies.

US State Department
The US embassy in Manilla immediately released $100,000 to provide food, water, sanitation and other humanitarian resources. 
The secretary of state, John Kerry, said on Monday the department was working with a US nonprofit called the mGive Foundation to coordinate financial and material donations via mobile phones. Kerry said: "Our embassies in the Philippines and Palau are in close and constant contact with their partners in local governments to direct aid to the right places. When I spoke with Philippines foreign minister, Albert del Rosario, I assured him of our full commitment to providing all necessary assistance.”
The embassy posted on its Facebook page a list of aid organisations it has worked with in the past, to help those looking to donate money to relief efforts. 
Other humanitarian aid
The US Agency for International Development has sent a disaster assistance response team to the area, to make assessments regarding where best to deploy government resources. That have also sent emergency shelter and hygiene materials which are expected to arrive early this week, along with 55 tons of emergency food, to feed 20,000 children and 15,000 adults for up to five days
The American Red Cross has sent staff to the area and activated its family tracing services for people trying to locate lost family members. Google has launched a people-tracker of its own.
How to help
The Guardian has collected a list of the international aid organisations who are taking donations.
