Enormous aid effort begins in regions devastated by typhoon Haiyan

The first consignments of aid have begun arriving in storm-devastated regions of the Philippines as the true extent of the destruction wreaked by typhoon Haiyan began to emerge, three days after one of the most powerful storms ever recorded made landfall.
Two US marine C-130 cargo planes arrived in Tacloban, the coastal city where virtually every building was destroyed by the typhoon's huge storm surge, and were unloading emergency items on Monday evening – the first wave of an aid operation taking in dozens of countries and agencies.
The confirmed death toll is 942 and one mass grave in Tacloban was reported to have been filled with 500 bodies. About 10,000 people are estimated to have died overall.
While winds gusting to 170mph caused significant damage, the devastation in areas such as Tacloban – where scenes are reminiscent of the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami – was principally the work of the 6-metre-high storm surge, which carried away even the concrete buildings in which many people sought shelter.
Survivors spoke of walls and roofs giving way, plunging them into the water.
"The situation is bad, the devastation has been significant. In some cases the devastation has been total," the cabinet secretary, Rene Almendras, told reporters in Manila.
The commander of the US marine contingent in Tacloban, Brigadier General Paul Kennedy, said after a helicopter flight over the city: "I don't believe there is a single structure that is not destroyed or severely damaged in some way. Every single building, every single house."
The confirmed toll is likely to rise significantly once rescuers reach more remote parts of the coast, currently cut off from communications.
Guiuan, a town on Samar island to the east of Tacloban with a population of 40,000, is believed to have been largely destroyed.
The aid effort is both enormous in scale – according to the United Nations, more than 600,000 people have been displaced by the storm – and fraught with complications, with roads blocked and most ports and airports closed.
In Tacloban even the initial work of removing bodies from the debris has yet to properly begin. Some survivors are begging for supplies while others have ransacked shops, some of which are now guarded by police.
While authorities moved about 800,000 people before Haiyan made landfall on Friday, the great reach of the storm surge meant many still perished.
Fermin Carangan, an air force commander in Tacloban, described trying to sit out the storm inside his military base. "It was 7.30 in the morning. The rain and wind were so strong and the water surged in fast and rose without letup. We had no time to move elsewhere, so we clambered up the room, about 10 of us," he told the Associated Press.
"Then the roof started to peel off. One by one we were exposed to the rain and we were just holding on to the roof wooden beams. Then the walls of the building started collapsing and each one of us started falling into the water. We were yelling at each other. Then all of us got separated."
Carangan spent five hours clinging to a wooden roof beam before paddling to shore, managing to rescue a young boy also floating on a piece of wood.
Others were not so lucky. Nestor Librando, a 31-year-old carpenter, took the body of his two-year-old son to a chapel in Tacloban. When the waters rose and his family were swept out of a military compound where they took shelter, he had held the boy in one arm and his three-year-old son in another. The younger child slipped from his hands and was pulled under the water.
"This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life, the worst thing I could imagine," Librando said. "I brought him to this chapel because there was nowhere else to take him. I wanted Jesus Christ to bless him."
With winds weakening to about 75mph, the tropical storm made landfall in northern Vietnam early on Monday. Authorities there evacuated hundreds of thousands of people but there were no reports of significant damage or injuries. However, local media in southern China reported seven people had died as the storm moved into Hainan and Guangxi provinces.
The Philippines president, Benigno Aquino, has declared a "state of national calamity", but has said that outside the provinces of Leyte and Samarm, there appeared to be few casualties.
Britain has promised £6m in aid and is sending experts, with other assistance pledged from the EU, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, along with dozens of aid agencies and UN organisations.
Co-ordinating this effort will be a major challenge, aid experts have warned. The international response to the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti in 2010 was plagued by confusion, prompting aid agencies to say people died needlessly because of chaotic initial phases of the humanitarian effort.
Leonard Doyle, from the International Organisation for Migration in Manila, said a repeat of those mistakes appeared less likely here.
"The challenge is huge but you have a government that is coherent and which works well with donors," Doyle said. "President Benigno Aquino is very much present, very engaged. It is a well-functioning government at multiple levels. The wild card is the sheer extent of the disaster."
