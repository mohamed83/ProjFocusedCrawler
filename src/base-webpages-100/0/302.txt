The UK was well prepared to act swiftly and decisively in response to typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and its early response helped galvanise the international community, a UK aid watchdog said on Tuesday.
The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai), which was set up to scrutinise UK aid, praised the Department for International Development (DfID), giving the overall response to typhoon Haiyan a green assessment, its top ranking.
Haiyan, also known as Yolanda, struck the Philippines with devastating force in November, killing more than 6,200 people, affecting a further 14 million people, and damaging 1.1m homes. Led by DfID, the UK provided £77m of humanitarian aid, making it the largest single donor. In addition to the UK government's response, the British public donated a further £85m through the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) appeal.
Though DfID does not have a presence in the Philipppines, the UK was among the first countries to respond, enabling it to mobilise support from other donors, said Icai. The watchdog was also impressed by DfID's co-ordination with the Ministry of Defence and other departments, calling it a good example of inter-departmental co-operation.
"DfID's preparedness to respond, combined with the effective use of military assets and pace of decision-making, meant that the UK was able to make an early and vital contribution to this international response," said Mark Foster, lead commissioner. "The Philippines is, alongside many other parts of the world, increasingly prone to natural disasters, and DfID has an opportunity to play an even more influential role in the global humanitarian system and increase the likelihood of future effectiveness."
DfID provided basic supplies, especially emergency shelter, which were critical in the earliest stages after the typhoon hit. The department's procurement was so effective that it brought more non-food items in the first six weeks than the UN's humanitarian response depot network, noted Icai.
The challenge for DfID now is to consider how to support the recovery, given that it does not intend to establish a permanent presence in the Philippines.
Icai attributes DfID's effective response to substantial changes the department took following an independent humanitarian emergency response review (Herr) in 2011, chaired by Lord Ashdown, the former Liberal Democrat leader. Among the review's key suggestions were a more anticipatory approach and an improvement in the leadership of the international humanitarian system.
After the Ashdown review, DfID set up a global risk register, which identified the Philippines as a very high-risk territory. It bolstered its conflict, humanitarian and security department to 17 people, many deployable at short notice. At any given time, there are six rapid response leaders available for deployment within six hours.
Other measures included: pre-positioned stockpiles in the UK and Dubai, such as tents, blankets and water containers for 18,000 people; a rapid response facility with pre-selected NGO partners that allows quick submission and approval of proposals; memoranda of understanding with other departments, including the MoD, on cross-charging costs and lines of command; and a larger communications and press team.
"Co-ordination across departments was effective," said Icai. "As a result DfID was able to deliver a joined-up response, combining military and civilian aspects in line with Herr recommendations. DfID had a clearly-defined leadership role for planning and co-ordination, including of military assets. This contrasted with some of the other military groups involved and helped to maintain central control and to ensure that the right resources were deployed."
Unlike other militaries, the UK put its armed forces under the explicit direction of DfID, winning praise from other agencies on Britain's effective use of military assets.
DfID sent a three-member team to the Philippines in the buildup to Haiyan so that the department had a presence at the start of the operation. Decision-making was prompt. Justine Greening, the international development secretary, approved DfID's proposal of support within one hour on the evening of Saturday 9 November, activating the rapid response facility. On 12 November, the first DfID-procured flights landed in Cebu and funding commitments were made to NGOs.
"We consistently heard from DfID's partners including DEC, UN agencies and NGOs, that DfID's early commitment of funding helped to leverage funds from other bilateral and private donors … the catalytic impact of DfID's early response should not be underestimated," said the report.
Icai said its rapid review lacked the scope to identify loss, wastage or fraud, but indicated that it did not hear reports of this and observed good practice at cash and food distributions, including operating complaints procedures. The watchdog recommended that DfID and the Foreign Office support the Philippines' reconstruction plan in strategic areas such as climate change resilience, and said DfID should build on the success of its response to strengthen its leadership within the global humanitarian response systems, and specifically of its stockpiling and logistics capacity.
"Britain was at the forefront of the international humanitarian effort in the Philippines, deploying DfID humanitarian experts just hours after the typhoon struck and delivering lifesaving aid to hundreds of thousands of survivors," said Greening, who visited the Philippines two weeks after the typhoon. "It is great to see that Icai has rightly recognised this and concluded that the UK's response to typhoon Haiyan was quick, targeted and effective … The UK will continue to work with the government of the Philippines to help them better cope with disasters like this in the future."
