Typhoon Haiyan: disasters on this scale are never entirely an 'act of God'


Fatima Measham








Factors such as political will and planning determine the extent of the devastation, as is painfully clear in the Philippines

I have to write to stay upright. I have to write so that grief does not sweep me away altogether.
My nerves were already raw last Thursday when the satellite images made it clear that Haiyan was monstrous, even in the context of a typhoon-prone region. It ticked 8.1 on the Dvorak scale, which maxes at 8.0. The size and intensity were phenomenal. The eye was heading for islands where friends and relatives lived. The spiral rainbands would skim over northern Mindanao, where I grew up.
When Haiyan hit Samar, it was packing 315kph winds. The initial, amateur videos that appeared on Facebook and Twitter were of a wall of wind and rain. Images started trickling in. As Yeb Saño, Philippine delegate at the Warsaw climate summit, put it: "I struggle to find words even for the images that we see on the news coverage. And I struggle to find the words to describe how I feel about the losses."
Initially I suppressed my devastation. On Saturday, I deflected to my memories of tropical storm Washi in 2011 and Bopha, which also struck Mindanao the following year. I railed against the denialism that was consigning the Philippines to intensifying typhoons. On Sunday, I decried the $390,500 in aid that was the Australian government's astoundingly low initial response.
I cloaked my grief in fury. But in the end, couldn't contain it.
For three days, I was anxious about friends who lived in the Visayas or who had family there. My dad's family lives in Maasin on the island of Leyte. I know way too many people in Cebu. On Sunday night, as I started pegging the data from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council on Google Maps, I felt ill.
Given the storm surge that swept people inland and the vast swathes of debris that buried them, I knew in my gut that the tallies were conservative.
I have had crying jags, the kind that make you feel like vomiting, once when someone told me that drawing a connection between Haiyan and climate change was "obscene overreach" and once after a phonecall from a friend checking to see how I was. Ordinary things: turning the tap on, preparing food, lying in bed make me cry. Water, food and shelter are scarce to be had in places struck hard by Haiyan. My life goes on and this sends me weeping.
I weep because I'm here and not there. I weep because no one gets to choose where they are born. I weep because my family and friends are fine this time.
The Philippines is disaster-prone. Filipinos are stoic about their fate, given the periodic earthquakes and typhoons. This stoicism also probably emerges from a form of Catholicism that fetishises suffering. The phrase "Bahala na" is embedded in the culture: "Leave it to God'".
However, disasters are never entirely an "act of God", as insurers put it, or "natural". The scale of fatalities and destruction rests on other factors such as political will at the national level, local capacities, infrastructure and protocols. For a country of 7,000-plus islands, highly dense urban populations, remote rural hamlets and mountainous regions, topography is also a significant factor. All these things explain in part why national and local governments have been recently overwhelmed – the disaster after the disaster.
Though recriminations are coming in thick and fast against the backdrop of despair and confusion, it is hard to tell how prepared anyone could have been for the sort of typhoon that wiped out an estimated 80% of one city. How do you do all the right things in the face of the unprecedented?
It is clear that this devastation will rewrite the books – in terms of risk mitigation, disaster preparation and response. There is no acceptable alternative in that regard.
Haiyan has shifted the calibrations made about extreme weather events, not just for Filipinos. The international community has been heart-piercing in its magnanimous support. Yet how far will they go in terms of shielding the Philippines and other vulnerable nations from routine cataclysm?
