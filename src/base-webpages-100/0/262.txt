Pop singer Justin Bieber visited the Philippines Tuesday to help victims of Typhoon Haiyan. The storm claimed thousands of lives and caused millions of dollars of damage to the country in early November.
Bieber, 19, arrived to the country on a special flight, Immigration officer Jerome Ollet said, according to the Associated Press. Bieber’s visit is a part of the teen pop star’s ongoing efforts to offer relief to those impacted by the typhoon.
Bieber posted a photo a few weeks ago on his Instagram page where he posed next to a sign that read “Pray 4 Philippines” with his initials at the bottom.

The singer then posted a video on his Facebook page on Dec. 4 asking for his fans help with giving back to the Philippines. “The moment I heard about the tragedy a few weeks back,” Bieber said, “I thought I can count on you guys to make a difference.” Those that donate to the singer’s cause will be entered for a chance to meet and hang out with the Canadian singer at a recording studio, Bieber said in the video.
Bieber has risen more than $600,000 dollars so far that will go to charities like UNICEF, Action Against hunger, and the Philam Foundation. His goal is to raise $1 million according to the fundraising website. During the singer’s visit to the country he performed an exclusive concert in Tacloban according to local media reports.
About to go perform the last #believetour show. The real last one and the most important one of the tour. #GiveBackPhilippines — Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) December 10, 2013
