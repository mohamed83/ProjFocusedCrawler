A British man is among those missing in the Philippines in the wake of typhoon Haiyan, according to reports.
Colin Bembridge, 61, was staying with his Filipina partner Maybelle, 35, and their three-year-old daughter Victoria near Tacloban when the devastating storm struck.
Channel 4 News said the pharmacist, who lives in Grimbsy, had been visiting his girlfriend's relatives and had hired a beach house in Baybay, one of the ravaged coastal villages.
Typhoon Haiyan has left thousands dead and many more homeless, and large numbers of survivors are struggling without food, water and shelter.
The mother of Bembridge's partner, 79-year-old Lydia, showed Channel 4 News the wreckage of the beach house where her daughter and granddaughter had been staying.
"I just want to know whether they are dead or whether they were blown by the winds," she told the programme.
While searching the wreckage she found a dress belonging to Maybelle – the youngest of her eight children – and a games console belonging to Victoria.
She added: "Now that I am here I cannot see them. I am at a loss of where they are. My heart, it's hurting."
