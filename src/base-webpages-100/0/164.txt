AmeriCares Emergency Response Manager Karl Erdmann surveys the damage in Cebu. 







Stamford, Conn. – Nov. 15, 2013 – More than $1 million in medical aid and relief supplies left AmeriCares Connecticut warehouse this afternoon destined for the Philippines. The 7,000 pounds of antibiotics, bandages, blankets and other relief supplies now en route to the disaster zone marks AmeriCares third major aid shipment since Typhoon Haiyan made landfall one week ago today.
AmeriCares first aid shipment, carrying enough medical aid to treat 20,000 typhoon survivors for three months, arrived in Manila on Nov. 14. A second air shipment of medicines and supplies is expected to arrive on Sunday, Nov. 17.
In the Philippines, AmeriCares relief workers are supplying hospitals treating the injured with medicines and supplies. Early today AmeriCares received confirmation that medical aid pre-positioned in the Philippines before the emergency had arrived at Divine Word Hospital in Tacloban – one of the few medical facilities in the city still operating. At the same time, AmeriCares delivered $20,000 in critically needed medicines to the Mactan Air Base Military Hospital, where injured typhoon survivors from Samar and Tacloban have been brought for treatment.
“The medical facilities that are still operational are running out of everything from pain medications and antibiotics, to basic supplies like gauze and bandages,” said AmeriCares Vice President of Emergency Response Garrett Ingoglia. “We have relief workers on the ground – and more on their way – to assess needs and coordinate the delivery of life-saving medicines and supplies.”
This weekend, AmeriCares relief workers will distribute food and emergency supplies in Basey, Samar province, and assess health needs in Roxas, Capiz province. More aid deliveries are expected next week as AmeriCares emergency response experts reach more areas in the disaster zone.
AmeriCares has been delivering aid to the Philippines since 1985 and supports an established network of 150 health care facilities, allowing it to quickly speed relief to disaster survivors. Over the years, the disaster relief and humanitarian aid organization has delivered more than $229 million in aid to the Philippines including relief supplies for survivors of last month’s deadly earthquake and Typhoon Bopha in 2012.
