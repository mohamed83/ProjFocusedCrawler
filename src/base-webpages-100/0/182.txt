Bringing old and young together
The action/2015 campaign, which is calling on governments to end poverty and address inequality, launches on 15 January.
HelpAge is working with people across generations to raise awareness of older people's vision of the world 
they want to live in.
Our network is
 joining national coalitions and youth groups to amplify the voices of 
older people, including 15 older campaign champions.
Find out how you can get involved! 


Haiti: five years on
In the five years since the Haiti earthquake, HelpAge has helped at least 1,000 older people move into new homes. We set up 16 older people’s associations to provide long-term support. 
We gave older people financial support after relocation, grants and training to set up small businesses, and training in disaster risk management.
Read more about our work in Haiti.

Age Demands Action
Older leaders speak out
Older men and women are at the centre of our work to tackle age discrimination and fight for older people's rights.
Our Age Demands Action Steering Group of older activists is informing the direction of 
HelpAge's campaign work.
They also represent older men and women in global and 
national decision-making processes.
Find out more about the Steering Group members in our interactive image mosaic. 

Global AgeWatch Index
How are older people faring?
The Global AgeWatch Index measures how well 96 countries are supporting their older populations. 
It is based on four domains that are key enablers of older people's wellbeing: income, health, capability and enabling environment.
Norway comes first and, apart from Japan, all top 10 countries are in Western Europe, North America and Australasia. Afghanistan comes bottom.

Older people's rights
Older people make a huge contribution to society yet suffer discrimination and abuse just because of their age.

Working with older people: Practical guidelines

Do you work with older people in the developing world? Need practical information on how to tailor programmes to older people's needs?
We have new practical guidelines for programme managers and people working with older people, drawing on experience in the HelpAge network.
Please use the guidelines for your own work, training or as a basis for producing more detailed, locally relevant materials.
The guidelines cover topics including emergencies, HIV and AIDS, rights and advocacy and health and care.
