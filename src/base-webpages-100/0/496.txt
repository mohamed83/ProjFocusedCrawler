The government will match public donations to leading UK charities raising funds for the disaster-hit Philippines pound for pound.
International development secretary Justine Greening said that under a new agreement with the Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC), the first £5 million donated by members of the public to the appeal will be matched.
The announcement came as the first consignment of UK aid prepares to leave for the stricken island nation, which was devastated by a typhoon leaving thousands dead.
A team of British medical experts are also due to depart while a Royal Navy warship and an RAF transport aircraft are helping the recovery effort.
Presenter Myleene Klass has urged the British public to donate while the prime minister described the scenes of devastation caused by the powerful cyclone as "heart-breaking".


The government had already committed £10 million in aid, so the new £5 million commitment will increase the UK's support to £15 million in total.Typhoon Haiyan - said to be the strongest ever to make landfall - has made roads impassable and left airports out of action, severely hampering relief efforts.
Klass, who is fronting the DEC appeal, said: "I have family out there in the Philippines that have survived this, but they really are the lucky ones, as for so many right now the story is so tragically different."
"It's hard to comprehend the catastrophic impact of Typhoon Haiyan until we realise that behind the huge numbers are real people, someone's father, mother or child. And that each one of us can help save each one of them."
