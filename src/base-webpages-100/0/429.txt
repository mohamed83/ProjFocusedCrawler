Help us protect children in emergencies around the world
Whenever or wherever disaster strikes, we respond rapidly to deliver life-saving food, medicine and water so children in danger get the help they need. We rely on money from our Children’s Emergency Fund to do this.
Currently there are 59 million children facing conflict, natural disasters and other complex emergencies in 50 countries across the world. Children are hardest hit – losing lives, families, homes and schools. 
From disasters in the Philippines, to mass malnutrition in South Sudan and the conflict in Syria – there’s never been a more challenging time for children. By donating today, you can help us reach more children – especially where there’s little media attention but the need for help is just as great.
Donate today and help change children’s lives.
Your gift will go directly to our Children's Emergency Fund to save and protect children in emergencies around the world.
