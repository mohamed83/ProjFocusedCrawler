The area has seen typhoons every year – just not of this magnitude. Having gone through severe typhoons, I don't think people thought they would not survive this one.
The storm was supposed to strike at 9am. But by 5.30am there was heavy rain and extremely strong winds so we knew it had made landfall. One hour later the cellphone signal went out and the hour after that there was no radio signal. The heart of the storm hit at 8.30am and an hour later the storm surge came in as well. It started to die down at 10.30am, so there were six hours in which children and families in extremely dilapidated housing had to go through that.
The building I was in was one of the sturdier ones, but the windows were smashed by flying debris and part of the roof was ripped off, so the rain was sweeping through and the whole place was flooded. When the flash-flooding came through it wiped out the whole living area downstairs: it was up to a metre-and-a-half high.
I think I went in quite mentally prepared for the typhoon but I was surprised by how strong it was. The devastation I was not prepared for. People were just in shock. They couldn't believe how powerful the storm was. People began to leave the evacuation centre [near us] – the roofs and windows had been smashed. People there really suffered from the storm surge and used a bed as a raft to float to our building and climb to the second floor.
They were trying to go home, look for relatives, make sure everyone was safe and salvage what was left of their homes – pretty much nothing. There were families who had left a family member behind to protect the house from being looted. There was a lot of debris and a lot of flooding. There were trees and fallen electricity lines strewn everywhere. On the side of the road people were laying out dead bodies covered in clothes and whatever they could find. There were children as well as adults.
I saw a dozen or so. But I am sure there are many in coastal areas that have not been retrieved or in places that completely flattened there must be a lot of bodies under there.
We had tried to co-ordinate with the government prior to the storm and had preparedness plans but they were thrown out of the window because the government itself was incapacitated. We walked for seven hours into the centre because no regional official was around.
We saw a lot of people with cuts and bruises where they had been hit by flying debris or glass had struck them but there was no way to get them the support they needed. Medical supplies from hospitals were looted because people realised there was no one around to help them. By Sunday, I got to a hospital in Tacloban and saw a sign outside saying: "No admission – no medical supplies."
On Saturday, everyone was desperate for food. By midday we saw looting for basic supplies, which escalated the day after into whatever they could get. We saw people taking refrigerators out; perhaps something they really needed – they knew they wouldn't be able to afford another one after the storm. Other people were taking flat-screen TVs. People were looting fashion outlets and taking high-heeled shoes – anything they could get. It was hard to tell whether it was opportunistic or desperate.
[They were] ripping out the gates of grocery stores because the markets were not open and they did not have food. They were angry at the government for not supporting them – they felt it was absolute hell and there was no way of recovering. It was absolutely clear not that they didn't want to help themselves but they couldn't [stop themselves].
