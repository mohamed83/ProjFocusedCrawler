 "She was always giving. Whatever you ask her, she would love to share her thoughts and love to share her views and bring out the best in you," he said."She was like a coach I'd say and very compassionate person, very, very compassionate."Ms Fotedar's husband has travelled to Nepal to recover her body.She will be taken to India where her final rites will be held."We are completely in shock right now. It's so hard to believe we've lost her," Ms Sharma said.Earlier on Monday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop had said the Government held "grave fears" for an Australian citizen who was known to be on Everest during the earthquake.While she could not provide any details about the Australian at the base camp, she said consular officials were working to confirm their identity."We have been able to confirm the safety of more than 850 Australians in the country," she said."I do hold grave fears for the welfare of an Australian who was known to be at the Mount Everest base camp where a number of deaths have occurred."

 Climber Jim Davidson said he felt the aftershock at Camp 1 on Everest."Just had our biggest aftershock yet here at C1 on Everest. Smaller than original quake but glacier shook & avalanches," he tweeted.At least 18 people who were staying at the Everest base camp have been confirmed dead as a result, making the event the deadliest disaster in Everest's history.It comes almost exactly a year after an avalanche killed 16 Sherpa guides, forcing the season to be cancelled.The official death toll from the Nepal earthquake has exceeded 3,800 and the government fears it could go past 5,000.The US Geological Survey said another magnitude-5.1 earthquake struck on Monday in the Indian state of West Bengal, causing people to rush out of their homes.Five hundred and fifty Australians are registered on the Smart Traveller website and Ms Bishop said DFAT had taken over 1,400 calls from family and friends of missing Australians.Ms Bishop said a nine-person crisis response team was on its way to Nepal to establish the number of Australians in the country and help provide humanitarian assistance."They will assist in the safety and welfare of Australians who remain unaccounted for," she said.
