Fears for Australians missing in Nepal
Devastation witnessed firsthand
At least 10 dead and hundreds stranded at Everest
Kathmandu: A massive earthquake has killed more than 1800 people as it tore through large parts of Nepal, toppling office blocks and towers in Kathmandu and triggering a deadly avalanche at Everest base camp.It is the quake-prone Himalayan nation's worst disaster in more than 80 years.

A home ministry official said on Sunday that the official death toll had risen to 1805, with 4718 people injured.

The final toll from Saturday's 7.8-magnitude quake could be much higher, and dozens more people were reported killed in neighbouring India and China.Emergency workers fanned out across the Himalayan nation to rescue those trapped under collapsed homes, buildings and other debris.

Nepal has urged countries to send aid to help it cope with the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that struck on Saturday.Fears are held for dozens of Australians listed as missing in Nepal.Offers of help poured in from governments around the world, with the United States announcing it was sending in a disaster response team.

"Deaths have been reported from all regions except the far west. All our security personnel have been deployed to rescue and assist those in need," Nepal police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam told AFP.Officials said 10 people were killed when an avalanche buried parts of Mount Everest's base camp in Nepal where hundreds of mountaineers have gathered at the start of the annual climbing season.Among the dead at Everest was Dan Fredinburg, a Google executive and self-described Google adventurer.

He was travelling with the UK-based expedition company Jagged Globe, which said in a statement on its website that Sherpa guides and team members other than Fredinburg were safe, including two with non-life-threatening injuries.Three other company employees in the same group are safe, said Lawrence You, Google's director of privacy, in a post on Google Plus. "We are working to get them home quickly," You said.Separately, Google said it had launched a "person finder" tool to help track people missing in the earthquake and would commit $1 million to its response.

"We don't have the details yet, but 10 have been reported dead so far, including foreign climbers," Gyanendra Kumar Shrestha, an official in Nepal's tourism department, told AFP."We are trying to assess how many are injured. There might be over 1000 people there right now, including foreign climbers and Nepalese supporting staff."Experienced mountaineers said panic erupted at base camp which had been "severely damaged".Romanian climber Alex Gavan was tweeting from base camp following the avalanche.

But the worst damage was in Kathmandu, where the historic nine-storey Dharahara tower, a major tourist attraction, was among buildings brought down.At least a dozen bodies were taken away from the ruins of the 19th-century tower, according to an AFP photographer, who saw similar scenes of multiple casualties throughout the city."It was difficult to breath, but I slowly moved the debris. Someone then pulled me out. I don't know where my friends are," Dharmu Subedi, 36, who was standing outside the tower when it collapsed, said from a hospital bed.At least 42 people were known to have died in India, including 30 in the eastern state of Bihar, while buildings in the capital New Delhi had to be evacuated.Meanwhile, China's official Xinhua news agency said 13 people were killed in the Tibet region.The United States Geological Survey said the shallow quake struck 77 kilometres northwest of Kathmandu at 0611 GMT (1611 AEST).Aftershock tremors could be felt more than two hours after the initial quake.USGS initially measured the quake at 7.5 magnitude and later adjusted it to 7.8, with a depth of 15 kilometres.A Reuters reporter in Kathmandu said he had seen some buildings collapse and walls of several houses reduced to rubble. "Everyone is out in the streets, people are rushing to the hospital," the reporter said.The city is home to ancient, wooden Hindu temples. Photographs posted online showed buildings left in rubble, large cracks along roads and residents sitting in the street holding babies.Tremors were felt as far away as New Delhi and other northern cities in India, with reports of tremors lasting almost one minute."Massive tremors have been felt here in Delhi and several other parts of India," said a newsreader on NDTV in Delhi."You can see pictures of our Delhi studios, where the windows rattled and everything shook for a very long time, for a minute perhaps or longer," she said as footage showed studio ceiling camera lights shaking.A police officer in the control room of neighbouring Indian state of Bihar said the phone lines were jammed with callers from across the heavily populated state. "We don't know about the casualties, we are flooded with calls."Modi convened a high-level meeting with ministers and top officials to assess the situation. There were no preliminary reports of damage anywhere in India, Home Minister Rajnath Singh told the Press Trust of India.People living in Nepal's capital of Kathmandu fled their homes when the initial temblor hit, and remained out in the open as powerful aftershocks continued to rock the city."It was so powerful and the entire house was shaking, so we got out," said Sila Gurung, 28, who lives in a three-storey home with her mother in Kathmandu's Nakhipot district, close to the popular tourist site Patan Durbar Square."It's still shaking now. Everyone is very scared, and no one knows when it will be safe to go back home."The south Asia region has a history of catastrophic earthquakes because the tectonic plate that carries the Indian subcontinent is pushing northward into the main Asian plate. About 60 per cent of the India's land area faces moderate to severe seismic hazard, according to its National Disaster Management Authority.Iran and Pakistan in April 2013 were hit by a major earthquake measuring 7.8 that was centred on the region straddling their common border. The ground shook as far away as Dubai and New Delhi.A 6.9-magnitude quake in September 2011 jolted India's eastern Sikkim state, killing more than 80 people. The 2005 Kashmir quake killed more than 70,000 in Pakistan.A major temblor in western Gujarat state in 2001 killed about 25,000 people and caused more than $US4 billion dollars of damage. A 1934 earthquake centred in Nepal, just west of Sikkim, killed more than 16,000 people.Bloomberg, Reuters, AAP, AFP
