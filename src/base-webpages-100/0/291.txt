A week after super-typhoon Haiyan slammed into the Philippines, survivors still have no food or clean water and large numbers of bodies lie unburied.
President Benigno Aquino will return to Leyte province on Saturday amid widespread criticism of Manila's lack of preparation for the storm and the slowness of aid delivery. Authorities acknowledged on Friday that supplies had yet to reach many remote areas.
"We need to double our efforts because, if this drags on, [people] will grow desperate," the president said as he visited a packing station for relief supplies on Thursday night, urging Filipinos to do more to help those in need.
The death toll had reached 3,261, officials said, with the state news agency reporting that more than 12,000 were injured.
"I hope [the death toll] will not rise any more. I hope that is the final number ... If it rises, it will probably be very slight," said Eduardo del Rosario, director of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.
The mayor of devastated Tacloban cited figures of 4,000 dead across the central Philippines, while the United Nations put the toll at 4,460, but later said it was reviewing that figure.
Earlier this week, Aquino said the loss of life would probably be around 2,000 to 2,500, and dismissed a local estimate of 10,000 as overstated and caused by "emotional trauma". The regional police chief who gave that figure to the media was removed from his post on Thursday night. A police spokesman said Elma Soria was transferred to headquarters in Manila due to an "acute stress reaction".
The Red Cross put the number of missing at 25,000, from 22,000 on Thursday, but noted that it could include people who have since been located.
Authorities say 18,000 people are now involved in the rescue and relief effort. The flow of aid to the affected area has increased dramatically in the last two days as international aircraft, ships and personnel, including a US aircraft carrier group, have arrived to speed up distribution. On Friday a Norwegian merchant navy training vessel docked with World Food Programme supplies, including 40 tonnes of rice, medical equipment and 6,200 body bags.
But with many roads still blocked and communications barely operating, survivors were increasingly frustrated and alarmed by the inadequacy or total lack of supplies.
An official update on relief efforts on Friday morning said aid had reached only 30 of 40 towns in Leyte province, where the typhoon – known in the Philippines as Yolanda – wreaked terrible damage.
The defence secretary, Voltaire Gazmin, told the Associated Press: "There are just a few more areas in Leyte and Samar that have not been reached and our hope is that we will reach all these areas today, 100%."
In Marabut, across the bay from Tacloban and where every one of the 15,946 homes was destroyed, relief supplies finally arrived on Thursday afternoon.
"We feel totally forgotten," the local government official Mildred Labado told AP, hours before the sacks of food arrived.
"Only places like Tacloban are getting attention … But we are also victims. We also need help."
The mayor, Percival Ortillo Jr, said the goods would sustain residents for only one or two days: "It's just not enough".
An official bulletin said power had only been fully restored in four of the 20 provinces which suffered damage to the supply. Three more had partial restorations of power.
The socio-economic planning secretary, Arsenio Balisacan, said a government taskforce would prepare a detailed recovery and reconstruction plan in two to three weeks. He said annual economic growth was likely to be cut to 6.5-7%, down from the previous government estimate of 7.3%.
The UK-based risk analysis firm Maplecroft said the Philippines was the country most at risk from natural disasters. Such catastrophes cost the country an average of $1.6bn (£994m) a year, according to an Asian Development Bank estimate.
Officials in Manila said foreign countries had pledged $97m in aid. In the UK, the Disasters Emergency Committee said its appeal had raised more than £30m in days.
