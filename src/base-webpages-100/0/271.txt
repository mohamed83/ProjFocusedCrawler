BASEY/MANILA, Philippines Nov 7 (Reuters) - A year after
one of the world's most powerful storms smashed into the
Philippines, a group of women are stitching their lives back
together by weaving colourful reeds used in handicrafts sold by
the world's top retailers.
Their workshop is a far cry from the high-end shops selling
their products such as handbags and homewares on 5th Avenue in
New York.Sitting in one of the caves dotting the seaside highway of
Basey town in central Philippines, about a dozen women weave the
reed plant, known as tikog, which is sold to sustain their
families still struggling to make ends meet after Typhoon Haiyan
left more than 7,000 dead or missing last Nov. 8."Weaving helps feed our families. But we haven't really
recovered, we still don't earn enough," said Marilyn Corpus, 46,
from inside the cave whose cool temperature helps preserve the 
grass.Amongst the despair and devastation wrought by Haiyan - the
strongest storm ever recorded to hit land - hundreds of women
weavers have emerged as the main breadwinners in their families.Most of the weavers say they received relief and building
materials for their homes from foreign and local NGOs and
private groups, but none from the government, possibly because
of their remote location.But theirs is a rare story of hope in the region's rural
economy, which was mainly dependent on the coconut groves
destroyed by the storm.In a country where about one in four people lived below the
poverty line at the beginning of last year, Haiyan drove another
1.5 million Filipinos into the extreme hardship of living on
less than $1 a day.The U.N.'s International Labor Organization (ILO) says
nearly 6 million lost their jobs immediately after the typhoon -
mostly retailers, service crew, coconut farmers, fishermen.Most of those from the 44 worst-hit provinces in the centre
of the country decry the government's relief effort.Data from the U.N. humanitarian team working in the disaster
areas shows that more than half of the 1.05 million houses
damaged by Haiyan remained totally destroyed or unsafe as of
July. The government estimates it needs almost 170 billion pesos
($3.8 billion) to rebuild all Haiyan-affected communities.Some of the coconut farmers are now growing vegetables and
have livestock, while some fishermen have returned to the seas,
albeit only to shallow waters reachable by their unmotorized
boats. But for most of the typhoon victims, a more sustainable
livelihood is still far from sight."We're seeing very good signs of recovery, but we're not
there yet," said Michel Rooijackers, deputy director for
Philippine operations of Save the Children, adding that recent
studies show many of the poor survivors "are just meeting their
survival level, so they are getting by, just getting by".Almost 25,000 people still live in tents, shelters and
bunkhouses in the hardest hit regions in central Philippines,
including Tacloban City, considered Haiyan's ground zero as it
accounted for almost half of the death toll.A STITCH IN TIMES SAVESA year later, Samar's women weavers stand out as being among
the most resilient and industrious workers.Weeks after the typhoon, aid organisations identified the
weavers as being critical in holding families together - both
socially and as primary income earners. They were given training
and funding to optimise their household standing.Philippine fashion company Banago, whose bags and home
accessories are made from mats produced by Basey weavers, has
doubled its workforce since the storm to about 1,000 weavers.
The Banago range is a top seller at high-end retail stores such
J. Crew, Anthropologie, Nordstrom and Macy's.Haiyan washed away Banago's entire production facilities in
Basey, but the company's founder Renee Patron and her partners
decided to restart their business a few months after the
disaster struck."The typhoon made the business more focused, and it also
gave me the opportunity to learn much more about the women ...
and how we can make their lives better," said Patron."We had the women rebuild their homes and after that we just
tried to get them back to work," said the U.S.-based
merchandiser and fashion designer.($1 = 44.7850 Philippine Pesos)
