Education


Plan has supported thousands of children to return to school through the provision of ‘back-to-school’ kits, rebuilding classrooms, training teachers and supplying school equipment.
                    
                


Livelihoods


Cash-for-Work projects provided income that helped families meet their basic needs and stimulated the local economy, while the work rehabilitated and rebuilt communities.
                    
                


Protection


Plan worked to provide safe and supportive Child-Friendly Spaces for thousands of children where they could play, learn and get much-needed emotional support. 
                    
                


Shelter


We have assisted typhoon survivors with construction of temporary shelters, support to rebuild their homes and provision of household items to help with their recovery.
                    
                


Health and Nutrition


Thousands received critical medical care through medical missions, ‘one-stop-shop’ mobile health clinics, and construction of new permanent, disaster-resilient health clinics.
                    
                


Water, Sanitation and Hygiene


Within hours of the typhoon passing, Plan distributed water kits and provided critical hygiene and sanitation information, supporting this with construction or rehabilitation of water, hygiene and sanitation facilities.
