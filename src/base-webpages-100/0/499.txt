What you said: this week's top reader comment
Commenting on our article on the conditions of cashew nut workers in India, heatherselkie said:


Well, that's depressing. I know they have a very hard weird pod thing, and that cashews are actually not very good for you, but yummy. For several years I worked at an organic food business where we bagged boxes upon boxes of cashews. Salted, unsalted, roasted, raw. Organic, from India or Sri Lanka, but wow, yet again I was the end of a long chain of suffering so we in the west could have exotic food! And I was paid much much more than these poor workers would ever see in their lives. I never saw a box that said fair trade though. Not fair. If we want such foods, we should be going in and setting up safe factories with my gosh, free gloves for everyone and proper work stations. Boring menial is one thing, but it can be done with proper ergonomic stations, breaks and oh my gosh, sanitation! Not sure I will want to eat a cashew again …
