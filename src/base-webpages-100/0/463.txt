The strongest storm ever to make a landfall has devastated the Philippines, killing at least 2,000 people (and experts think the number of victims could rise to 10,000) and leaving millions homeless.
This week's news and resources round up focuses on the challenges of the relief effort. How do governments, aid agencies and individuals help recovery after such widespread damage? And how have social networks helped agencies to crowdsource vital information?
Here is a collection of news stories, multimedia, teaching resources and websites to help explore the Typhoon Haiyan crisis in the geography classroom and beyond.
From The Guardian
Guiuan, the first place hit by Typhoon Haiyan – videoThe Guardian's Tania Branigan is the first foreign journalist to report from Guiuan, the first place hit by the typhoon on 8 November. Almost all the town's 50,000 residents are now homeless and not a single building has been left unscathed – aid is just starting to trickle into the hungry and desperate population.
Survivors struggle to make sense of a shattered worldThese powerful interviews with survivors of the typhoon are vital reading as the days of hunger, thirst and homelessness are grow unbearable for the population of the town of Guiuan.
Typhoon Haiyan as it happened – live blogThe news and expert analysis of the storm as it unfolded on 8 November 2013, lots of useful links here for older students to explore.
Before and after – in picturesThese before and after images from the typhoon-struck region of the Philippines reveal the full extent of the catastrophic destruction.
Typhoon Haiyan relief effort – in pictures Powerful pictures coming in as aid workers and relief supplies head into eastern provinces hit by typhoon Haiyan, with a particular focus on Tacloban.
Typhoon Haiyan: five days on – in picturesThousands of survivors are left without shelter, food and power in the Haiyan devastated regions in the Philippines.
The worst affected areas – interactiveA useful map revealing the path of the deadly storm – great for the whiteboard.
Philippines aid effort hampered by lawlessnessThis article reveals the complex challenges of getting relief to typhoon-devastated areas, where reports of gunshots, stabbings and ambushes have caused many residents and aid workers to fear for their lives. There have been warnings of traffickers posing as relief workers and targeting women and children.
