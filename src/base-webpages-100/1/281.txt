Stamford, Conn. – Dec. 13, 2012 – AmeriCares is delivering emergency medical aid and relief supplies for survivors of Typhoon Bopha in the Philippines – the worst storm to hit the disaster-prone country this year. More than 700 people have been confirmed dead and hundreds more are still missing since the storm battered the southern region of the country with heavy rains and wind gusts up to 137 mph on Dec. 4.
AmeriCares has awarded a $15,000 grant to Asia America Initiative to provide a five days’ supply of food, along with blankets, soap, shampoo and other personal care items, for 1,000 families affected by the storm. AmeriCares is also preparing to deliver an emergency air shipment of medical aid including antibiotics, gastrointestinal medicines, wound care supplies and nutritional supplements from its Connecticut warehouse.
“Nearly 800,000 people have been displaced and need assistance,” said AmeriCares Vice President of Emergency Response Garrett Ingoglia. “Our emergency aid will help provide food and medical care for families suffering from this horrific disaster.”
AmeriCares has been aiding survivors of natural disasters, political conflict and extreme poverty around the world for 30 years, saving lives and restoring health and hope. Since 1985, AmeriCares has delivered $219 million in medicines, medical supplies and humanitarian aid to the Philippines, including aid for survivors of Typhoon Washi in 2011, back-to-back typhoons in the fall of 2009 and Typhoon Frank in 2008.
