Emmanuel T. Bautista, the military chief of staff.The arrests came a week before the party’s armed wing, the New People’s Army, is to commemorate its 45th anniversary.The couple face charges of crimes against humanity, including multiple murders, General Bautista said in a statement. The statement provided no other details about the arrests. Local news media reports said five other people were also arrested.General Bautista said the arrests were “another victory for the combined efforts” of the military and the police and called on other members of the Communist Party and the New People’s Army to “lay down their arms, abandon the armed struggle and return to the comfort of their families and join us in bringing peace and development to our nation.” Ms. Tiamzon, the party’s secretary general, was arrested in the early 1990s but escaped from custody. Many other senior Communist Party leaders have also been killed or captured over the years, including some who the rebels said were consultants in peace negotiations who were supposed to be immune from arrest while talks were continuing.Talks to end the Marxist insurgency in the Philippines, one of Asia’s longest-running, collapsed in 2011 because of disagreements over releasing several jailed rebel leaders. In a statement from the Dutch city of Utrecht where he lives in exile, Luis Jalandoni, chief negotiator for the rebels, condemned the arrests, saying the Tiamzons carry government safe-conduct passes as “consultants” in the peace talks.ShareSaveShow Full Article                            xSharexEmailTwitterRedditGooglePermalinkhttp://nyti.ms/1iqadPbToolsSaveMore In WorldBelgium Confronts the Jihadist Danger Within The thwarted terrorist operation highlighted the dangers posed by a well-developed underground pipeline that has made Belgium the biggest per capita contributor in Europe of fighters to Syria.After Long Legal Fight, Inquest Is Set to Begin in Death of Putin CriticHearings will start this week in London on the 2006 death of Alexander V.
