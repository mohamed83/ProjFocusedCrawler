Help typhoon survivors

Typhoon Hagupit swept through the Philippines, bringing more destruction to families still recovering from last year's devastating Typhoon Haiyan. The second major disaster in a year is forcing people to rebuild all over again, but their resilience has not been destroyed — and they need your help.
Mercy Corps is on the ground working to help communities build back stronger. Thanks to supporters like you, we've provided emergency cash assistance, improved water systems and are making sure small business owners have financial support to reopen, earn an income and revitalize the local economy. At the same time, we continue providing support to refugees fleeing the war in Syria, to hungry children in South Sudan, and to families in crisis around the world.
Your gift to our Humanitarian Response Fund makes our lifesaving and life-changing work possible in the Philippines and all the countries we serve. Thank you.








Over the last five years, we have spent 88% of our resources on programs that help people in need.








Mercy Corps is a 501(c)3 charity. Your gift is tax-deductible as allowed by U.S. law.
