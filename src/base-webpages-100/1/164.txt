Protection


Children are always among those worst affected by a disaster, and among the most vulnerable afterwards. Plan worked to provide safe and supportive ‘Child Friendly Spaces’ for 21,000 children where they could play, learn and get much-needed emotional support. We also supported and trained nearly 10,000 parents, children and community members to avoid violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of women and children.
44 separated and unaccompanied children identified and referred to support services to receive appropriate assistance
20,965 children supported to heal and recover through Child-Friendly Spaces, providing a safe space to play, learn and receive emotional support. Many of these Child-Friendly Spaces will be transitioned into semi-permanent community facilities with Plan’s support
460 Child-Friendly Space Volunteers recruited and trained in creative psychosocial support techniques
96 service providers trained to teach others how to provide psychosocial support to those affected by stressful events
30 fathers of children attending Child-Friendly Spaces trained in a Cash For Work project to make age and gender-sensitive toys for Child-Friendly Spaces, using local and indigenous materials
103 Community Child Protection Councils re-established to lead community efforts to protect children. 1,427 community members trained to protect children from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation and provide psychological ‘First Aid’
3,802 parents trained on positive parenting in stressful situations
4,101 girls and boys trained on prevention and response to gender-based violence
Four ‘Women-Friendly Spaces’ established to support outreach and service delivery for adolescent girls and breastfeeding mothers. The spaces will also be used to support survivors of violence and the development of women’s livelihoods in the long term.
