Of those, 16 were killed in the city of Borongan, on the eastern edge of Samar Island, near where the typhoon made landfall Saturday evening.With memories fresh of the destruction wrought just over a year ago by Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 7,300 people, 1.2 million people were evacuated. Relief workers praised the evacuation efforts for preventing greater casualties.The latest storm was also much weaker than Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest ever recorded. The current storm continued to lose strength as it made its way northwest on Monday, with the Joint Typhoon Warning Center of the United States downgrading it to a tropical storm.Concerns about the continued potential for damage remained, however, as the storm churned past the Manila area on Monday evening. The storm brought heavy rains, and its arrival coincided with high tide in the area of the capital, raising the likelihood of widespread flooding.Related CoverageResponse to Typhoon in Philippines Shows Lessons Learned From a Year Ago  Dec 7, 2014ShareSaveShow Full Article                            xSharexEmailTwitterRedditGooglePermalinkhttp://nyti.ms/12XchLUToolsSaveMore In WorldBelgium Confronts the Jihadist Danger Within The thwarted terrorist operation highlighted the dangers posed by a well-developed underground pipeline that has made Belgium the biggest per capita contributor in Europe of fighters to Syria.After Long Legal Fight, Inquest Is Set to Begin in Death of Putin CriticHearings will start this week in London on the 2006 death of Alexander V.
