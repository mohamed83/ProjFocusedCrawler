When the minister cracks a joke, laughter echoes out through the open doors.Now, having visited the Philippines three times over the past year (in November 2013, and then May and September, 2014), I truly believe the disaster recovery has come this far because of the remarkable resilience and spirit of the Filipino people.IMAGES: Before and After, six months onRush to rebuildWhen I first arrived in Western Samar in November 2013, just three weeks after the typhoon, all I could see was piles of debris, reminiscent of apocalyptic destruction.Yet, in the middle of the rubble and burning waste, I could hear the sound of people hammering, already in the process of rebuilding their houses. Women were washing their clothes and hanging it between the few walls that were left of their homes. Children were running around in flip-flops looking for scrap metal and old glasses they could sell to help their families get food. I even heard people singing. A year later and a lot has happened; Jednel's school is being rebuilt, he is attending a temporary school, and plays with his friends on the weekend.The rubble and fallen trees have been cleared and the vegetation is lush and green. Shops have reopened and the streets are crowded with cars, bicycles and taxis, while the community is out in full force, selling fruit and sweets. Children can play freely on the beach and they are finally allowed to go swimming in the sea once again.READ: Revisting Tacloban, six months after HaiyanChildren among most vulnerableJednel has grown a great deal since last November. Now he is a confident, relaxed boy who welcomes me to the house of his great grandmother.

It's like a freedom, where my family can live and be happy and proud."For me, hearing his words is testament to the resilience of Jednel, his family and the Filipino community.
