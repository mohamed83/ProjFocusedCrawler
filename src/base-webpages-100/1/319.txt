Philippines: Healing through play 




Children show their artwork at a child-friendly space in Leyte province
Plan has begun to set up child-friendly spaces in Leyte province
Child-friendly spaces provide children with safe areas to play and interact with one another
Child-friendly spaces protect children from violence and abuse
It is important for children to play and be mentally stimulated
Social interaction helps children through the effects of disasters
Playing and social interaction help children develop as normally as possible
Plan staff are constantly at hand to supervise the children
Among the activities that children take part in are drawing, puzzles and group games



26 November 2013: View the slideshow to see how Plan child-friendly spaces near relief distribution points are providing vital support to children affected by Typhoon Haiyan in Leyte, the Philippines.
Children are particularly vulnerable in a disaster - both physically and emotionally. In Leyte, many have lost loved ones, been forced from their homes and seen shocking scenes of death and destruction.
Child-friendly spaces - supported by Plan staff and volunteers - provide children with a place to play, learn, receive emotional support and process what's happened to them in a safe environment.
Staff also reach out to parents and guardians, providing them with advice on keeping children safe and how to support their emotional recovery.
Life-saving aid
Plan emergency teams are urgently distributing life-saving aid - including water, shelter and hygiene kits - to thousands of families affected by Typhoon Haiyan, which has affected over 13 million people in the Philippines.
Please help us deliver aid: Donate to the emergency appeal now
