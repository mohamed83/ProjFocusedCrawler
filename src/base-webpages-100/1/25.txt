Typhoon Hagupit slammed into the central Philippines' east coast late Saturday, knocking out power and toppling trees in a region where 650,000 people have fled to safety, still haunted by the massive death and destruction wrought by a monster storm last year.Residents living along coastal areas in Manila were evacuated to safer grounds as the local government ordered the pre-emptive evacuation in anticipation of Typhoon Hagupit which is expected to make its fourth landfall Monday, Dec. 8, 2014 in Manila, Philippines.(MORE: Here's Where Hagupit Is Headed | How They're Preparing)Typhoon Hagupit – known as "Ruby" to the locals – weakened into a storm Monday, a day after it left at least 21people dead, according to the Red Cross, and sent more than a million others into shelters in the Philippines.This storm comes one year after the central Philippines were devastated by Super Typhoon Haiyan, when more than 7,000 people were killed or left missing. At the top of this page, we'll continue to update our gallery showing the impacts of Hagupit on the Philippines.
