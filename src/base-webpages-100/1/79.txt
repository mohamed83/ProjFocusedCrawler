Super Typhoon Haiyan wreaks havoc in the Philippines, heads towards Vietnam
11th November: Victims of Typhoon Haiyan’s fury described the situation as “worse than hell” as they struggled with the aftermath of its impact. The storm’s winds of 250-kph (155-mph) destroyed houses, toppled trees and brought down power lines, but the most damage was caused by a storm surge that was up to 5 meters (16 feet) high.
The Philippines Red Cross estimates that at least 1,200 people have been killed by Haiyan, but the final count is probably much higher. The Mayor of Tacloban, Alfred Romualdez, said that it was “entirely possible” that 10,000 people may have died as a result of the storm in Leyte province.
Across the Philppines half a million people were evacuated from their homes and now most of them have no home to return to. The devastation has been compounded by a slow response, including lack of civic authority in many areas. In Tacloban survivors, desperate for food and clean water, were driven to looting to get essential supplies.
International governments have promised aid, with the US government saying it would immediately provide $100,000 through its US Agency for International Development (USAID) to deliver clean water, health care, and sanitation to the storm-hit areas. The US Military will also deploy its resources providing search-and-rescue and logistical support.
Meterologists are analyzing whether super typhoon Haiyan was the strongest typhoon ever. So far it is known that super typhoon Haiyan was 3.5 times more powerful than Hurricane Katrina that devastated parts of the southern US in 2005.
Haiyan is now crossing the South China Sea and heading towards Vietnam, where it is expected to make landfall on Monday morning. Its windspeeds are around 160 kph (100 mph) with gusts of 195 kph (120 mph). Vietnamese authorities are intensifying their preparations after seeing the devastation in the Philippines. It may lose some of its intensity and weaken to a tropical storm, however, it could still cause flooding across the country and its capital Hanoi. Vietnamese authorities and Red Cross services have evacuated 100,000 people to safer areas as the typhoon approaches. Meteorologists have predicted up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) of rain by Monday night for areas in northern Vietnam near its border with China. The world is waiting to see how much more devastation Haiyan may cause before its fury has abated.
 
Airports closed in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Haiyan / Yolanda strikes
Authorities in the Philippines announced the closure of 12 airports across the country as hundreds of flights have been grounded due to super typhoon Haiyan / Yolanda on Friday.
The airports that are closed are: Bacolod, Busuanga, Caticlan, Dumaguete, Iloilo, Kalibo, Legazpi, Masbate, Romblon, Roxas, Surigao, and Tacloban.
The capital of the Philippines, Manila, was not affected but popular holiday destinations such as Bohol and Boracay are in the path of the typhoon. Local residents and tourists have been evacuated from these resort destinations.
Australia, Canada and the UK have issued travel advisories to their citizens to avoid travelling to the typhoon-affected areas of the Philippines.
 
Super Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda Hits the Philippines
8th November : Super typhoon Haiyan (called Yolanda in the Philippines) hit the central region of the country this morning with great force. Metereologists are saying this is probably the strongest storm in history to hit land anywhere in the world. Haiyan’s windspeeds were recorded as high as 315 kph (195 mph) with gusts as fierce as 380 kph (235 mph) when it hit central Philippines. More studies after the storm has passed will confirm if indeed this is a world record.
Haiyan’s diameter is so large that storm clouds are stretching across two-thirds of the Philippines, a nation that isspans more than 1,850 kilometers (1,150 miles). The typhoon’s center has tropical-storm-force winds blowing for more than 240 kilometers from its eye or centre.
The full extent of the damage is not known at this time, but at least three people, including a 1-year-old child, have been reported killed across Cotabato and Cebu provinces. Reports of falling, trees, blocked roads and flooding due to heavy rainfall are coming in from provinces in the path of the storm. Prior to its impact 125,000 people had been relocated to evacuation centers.
President Aquino in an address to the nation on Thursday said that relief supplies and aircraft have been provided in areas anticipated to be hit by the typhoon. “The effects of this storm can be eased through solidarity,” he said.”This is a very real danger, and we can mitigate and lessen its effects if we use the information available to prepare.”
Philippines is hit by an average of 20 typhoons every year, and many of these cause severe havoc.

Super Typhoon Haiyan / Yolanda moves closer to Leyte and Samar provinces
7th November : The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has released information that super typhoon Haiyan / Yolanda is now located off the coast of the Philippines at a distance of 738 kilometers southeast of Guiuan in Eastern Samar province or 637 kilometers east of Hinatuan in the province of Surigao del Sur. Public storm warning signal number three has been raised over six areas in Mindanao and Visayas regions in the Philippines.
Haiyan / Yolanda is moving in a west-northwestly direction at a speed of 30 kph. Its windspeeds continue to be strong and range between 215 kilometers per hour (kph) and 250 kph.
It is moving towards the Leyte and Samar provinces and is expected to cross the Philippines coast over Guiuan in Eastern Samar province between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. local time on Friday morning.
It is expected to cross Leyte and Samar provinces and inflict heavy rainfall on Palawan province before moving away from the Philippines on Saturday. PAGASA estimated that rainfall would be heavy to intense and from 10.0 to 30.0 millimeters per hour in the 600 kilometer diameter of the typhoon.
The Philippines National Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) has alerted all its units as the super typhoon approaches the country.
 
Haiyan is now a Category 5 Super Typhoon
7th November : Super typhoon Haiyan has been classified as a Category 5 typhoon as its wind speeds have crossed 241 kph (150 miles per hour or mph). The typhoon is currently in the Pacific Ocean, near the islands of Palau and Yap. It is expected to continue in a westerly direction and cross the coast of the Philippines on Friday. Its windspeeds are expected to continue to grow in intensity and hit the coast at speeds of above 250 kph (155 mph). Gusts as high as 280 kph (175 mph) have been recorded as super typhoon Haiyan makes its way across the south Pacific. It is predicted to be the most powerful tropical storm in 2013.
The Japanese Meteorological Agency has estimated that super typhoon Haiyan’s air pressure at 905 millibars, which is an indicator of a severe storm. Meteorologists are predicting rainfall of over 8 inches across some regions in the Philippines with a threat of flooding, mudslides and landslides. The expected path of the typhoon will take it over the central Philippines where 10 million people reside and the Manila metropolitan area which is inhabited by 12 million people. Civic authorities are on standby and have made preparations for the onslaught of the super typhoon in the days ahead.
  
Super Typhoon Haiyan Approaches the Philippines
6th November : Officials in the Philippines have issued an alert for super typhoon Haiyan, which is rapidly approaching the east coast of the country. Super typhoon Haiyan will be called Yolanda in the Philippines and is expected to gain strength as it approaches the coast. It is expected to hit the provinces of Leyte and Samar on the eastern coast of the Philippines by this Friday.
Officials have asked residents of coastal areas in the path of the super typhoon to evacuate their homes and move to safer areas. Typhoon Haiyan’s windspeeds are currently around 240 kilometres per hour (kph) and gusts of up to 295 kph have been measured. It is expected to gain in intensity in the days ahead as it approaches the coast of this island nation.
Philippines has recently been hit by another natural disaster, when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 struck the country, killing 222 people and leaving approximately another 400,000 people without shelter, mainly in the provinces of Cebu and Bohol.
Interior Secretary Mar Roxas advised local residents to be prepared for the super typhoon, stating that “Every minute is important to ensure that lives are protected.”
