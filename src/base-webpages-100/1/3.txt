Crisis tools for Typhoon Hagupit

With Typhoon Hagupit (also known as Typhoon Ruby in the Philippines) expected to make landfall in the Eastern Visayas region tomorrow morning, we’ve launched a crisis page to help gather and relay critical information that we hope will help keep those living in affected areas safe from harm. 

The Crisis Response tools include: 

Google Public Alerts, which provide information about the typhoon across Google Search, Google Maps and Google Now, including the typhoon’s projected area of impact, estimated time of arrival, and advice on what to do to stay safe: 


Click on the Public Alert in Google Search, Google Maps or Google Now to find out more information about Typhoon Hagupit



You can also view our Crisis Map to keep track of the typhoon’s forecast path and find the nearest evacuation center for shelter using information provided by the Philippines' Department of Social Welfare and Development: 

Crisis Map provides details information including the typhoon’s forecast path and location of evacuation centers


We’ve also launched Person Finder, which allows individuals to post and search for the status of family or friends affected by the disaster. If you’re worried about someone, click on “I’m looking for someone” and type in their name. If you want to let people know you’re safe or have heard from someone in the area, then click on “I have information about someone” and put in their names and details. As the number of names and records increases, the tool will make it easier for those who are safe to pass on their status to people worried about them.





Update December 6: Person Finder is available on mobile phones. You can request status via SMS by sending an SMS to 0922 1000 600 (Sun/SMART and Globe subscribers), or +16508003977 (other network subscribers; please note international rates apply) with the message “Search” and then the person’s name. For example, if you’re searching for Juan Reyes, send the message “Search Juan Reyes”.
