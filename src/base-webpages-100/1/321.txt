Plan Philippines

Plan emergency teams are on the ground helping children and families affected by Typhoon Haiyan - one of the largest storms to ever make landfall.
Please support our vital relief work - donate to the emergency appeal
Plan has been working in the Philippines since 1961, helping poor children to realise their rights to health care, education, protection and a high quality of life.
We work in 420 communities nationwide. More than 80,000 families benefit from our projects.
