“Back In The U.S.S.R.”
Another Friday morning dawns across the western Pacific, and it looks like tropical troubles will put a damper on the Pope’s visit to the Philippines while winter keeps a tight grip on the northern tier of the region.
Tropical Storm 01W MEKKHALA (Amang) 
Tropical storm MEKKHALA, also named “Amang” by the Philippines’ weather agency PAGASA, is bearing down on the archipelago nation this morning, threatening to bring some nasty weather in for the visit of Pope Francis this weekend. Here’s the latest information from the official agencies on TS01W MEKKHALA (Amang):
JMA (RSMC for WPAC region)
15/2100UTC (16/0500PST) 
Position:       11.7N, 131.1E
Location:      620km E of Borongan City, Samar, PHL
Movement:   W @ 9kt (17kph)

JMA 15/21Z 5-day forecast track
 
PAGASA (Official agency for threatened area)
15/1800UTC (16/0200PST) 
Position:       12.0N, 130.7E
Location:      576km E of Borongan City, Samar, PHL

JTWC 15/21Z forecast track
 
Tropical storm MEKKHALA (Amang) is looking a bit more impressive this morning on satellite photos, but that belies the turbulence within the system. Drier air has been entrained into the circulation over the past 24 hours, and along with 15-20kt VWS (Vertical Wind Shear) from the southeast, the system is showing a partially exposed LLCC (Low-Level Circulation Center) while it tracks closer to the Philippines. It is believed this storm will not gain very much more strength, due to the unfavorable atmospheric conditions ahead of it, namely increased wind shear in the 20-30kt range, and increasing as it tracks farther north and west. In addition, a strong continental trough is starting to choke off the poleward outflow feature, which was quite impressive in the storm’s earlier stages.
Where is it going? That’s the $1,000,000 question right now, as the forecast models are all over the place with the future movement of this system. However, it is believed that MEKKHALA (Amang) will continue on a mostly westward track for the next 48 hours, while slowly turning a bit northwesterly beyond that. It would appear that the consensus brings the storm into the Philippines on the island of Samar sometime tomorrow afternoon. Residents of Samar, northern Leyte, and the entire Bicol region of the Philippines should begin preparations immediately for heavy rain and gusty winds, with the flooding and landslide hazards normally experienced during these weather events.
NORTH
The northern third of the WPAC region remains locked in the icy grip of winter as another strong storm system pulls off to the east of Japan. Beijing is the cold spot at -7C/19F this morning, but they are grateful for the push of cooler and cleaner air after achieving record levels of poor air quality this past week. Residents of Seoul are waking up to a chilly temperature of 2C/36F this morning, while Shanghai, at 6C/43F, and Tokyo, at 7C/45F, are enjoying a relatively warm start to the day considering it’s the middle of January. Winter weather systems will continue to line up and cross the northern third of the WPAC region for the next few days, bringing reinforcement of colder, wintery conditions.
CENTRAL
It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood for residents in the central portion of the WPAC region this morning as moderated air masses slide on through. Hong Kong residents are rising to a low of 15C/59F this morning, and it’s a relatively warm start for folks in Taipei as well, starting off at 14C/57F. In Hanoi, a weak trough has shuffled through the city, bringing slightly cooler air as they get started at 11C/52F. More of the same is in store through the weekend for these areas.
SOUTH
As mentioned earlier, tropical troubles will plague the northern half of the Philippines this weekend, while everyone else enjoys delightful weather. Ho Chi Minh residents are waking up to a comfortable temperature of 20C/68F this morning, while the tropical air has settled in for places like Manila and Davao City, both at 23C/73F in the wee hours today. Brunei is also off to a nice start today with a low of 24C/75F. While the Philippines gets the storm, everyone else can expect a pretty nice weekend overall.
TROPICS
The tropical islands of the WPAC region are enjoying some wonderfully warm weather this weekend, as most of the moisture in the I.T.C.Z. (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone) has been eaten up by TS01W and moved to the west. A fairly uniform air mass is settled in across the tropical WPAC as Yap, Palau, Chuuk, and Majuro islands start the day at 24C/76F, and Guam and Pohnpei are only slightly cooler at 23C/74F. it will be an outstanding weekend to go visit the islands as warm and fair weather continue. We will keep an eye on Tropical Storm MEKKHALA (Amang), so please keep checking back through the day for more information.
Have an awesome weekend!
