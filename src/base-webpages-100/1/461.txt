The implication of President Obama’s statement, “I’m not expecting transformation of Cuban society overnight”, is that closer economic and cultural ties with the US will eventually allow Cubans to see the light and embrace the “American way” (US decides to bring Cuba in from the cold, 18 December).
What is really needed is for US citizens to learn from other counties that its acceptance of the legalised bribery of its political funding practices, support of dictatorships around the world, lack of gun control, wealth inequality, poor healthcare provision, and tolerance of domestic poverty are much larger impediments of true democracy.Peter RobbinsLondon
• For decades, American policy towards Cuba has been hijacked by a small cartel of politicos in Florida and their wealthy benefactors. The US embargo is estimated to have cost the Cuban economy close to a trillion dollars over its 53-year span, not to mention the untold suffering inflicted on the Cuban people and the countless individuals whose lives were lost at sea, induced to emigrate because of privations and embargo-related laws. President Obama’s decision is courageous, and long overdue.Luis Suarez-VillaProfessor emeritus, University of California, Irvine, USA
• I look at Obama’s announcement of the complete end of the cold war with Cuba, including the opening of an embassy, with great caution. All monies spent by the federal government must be approved in a spending bill approved by Congress. The Republicans have vast majorities in the House and Senate. It is doubtful that even one Republican senator or congressmen would vote for one cent to be spent on the normalisation of relations with Cuba, and there are numerous Democrat senators and congressmen who if they supported this issue would risk losing their seats. Obama has nothing to lose, his political career is over. However, in the Congress this is a different matter. Obama is dreaming the impossible dream. George LewisBrackley, Northamptonshire
• When you say “US decides to bring Cuba in from the cold” I assume you mean “US decides to stop its illegal and spiteful harassment of Cuba”.Will McLewinStockport
• Cuba embodied the failure of American foreign policy. It lies less than 100 miles from the Florida straits, yet more than 50 years of embargo failed to motivate the Cuban people to rise and overthrow the communist leadership; or to instigate a violent regime change in this tiny Caribbean island.
The Cuban scenario has always acted as an inspiration for millions across the globe dismayed by American arrogance and double standards; for the impoverished and the downtrodden and the victims of American policies of imposed sanctions, unlawful invasions and occupations, isolationism and interventionism that resulted in countless deaths in Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Venezuela and the occupied Palestinian territories. And despite decades of these policies imposed on Cuba and its proximity to American shores; the US never managed to invade Cuba or to Americanise it. Today, Cuba has one of the most efficient educational systems in the world, universal literacy, universal health coverage and access to clean drinking water and sanitary services. It places children and young people at the heart of its policies. Needless to say, it has very low infant mortalities and high life expectancies. Even the most developed nations are envious of Cuba’s social and health system, and its ability to transmit its model and translate its knowledge and expertise into practice. The recent Ebola disease outbreak in west Africa has affirmed Cuba’s noble principles of equity, social justice and solidarity with the needy; something it has always done without asking for favours in return. It is time for the US to take note. Dr Munjed Farid Al QutobLondon
• Now that relations between the US and Cuba at last look set to be placed on a more normal footingit is surely time for the US government to apologise for the attempts to kill or otherwise injure Fidel Castro in the 1960s. That must include the use of an exploding cigar designed to singe his beard and the scattering of thallium salts in his shoes to make his beard drop out.Keith FlettLondon
• Listening to President Obama I was reminded of Albert Einstein, who defined “insanity” as “doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result”. How prescient.Dipak NandyNottingham
• The breakthrough in Cuba-US relations is a rare piece of good news in a troubled world, but it is a pity the president did not take a harder line in negotiations with his opposite number over matters ranging from extra-judicial killings, interference in other countries’ affairs, the lack of health provision for much of the population and the failed political system, not to mention the presence of a concentration camp on Cuban soil. Still, Mr Castro can only do so much at what is the start of a process. It is to be hoped that in the medium term he can at least persuade Mr Obama to close the facility at Guantánamo Bay and return the occupied territory to its rightful owners.Bert SchouwenburgInternational officer, GMB
• The torture may have ceased, for now, but the mindset that engaged in it hasn’t gone. This was demonstrated by the story of the six Guantánamo prisoners who, after years in captivity without being charged with a crime, let alone convicted, were this week sent to freedom in Uruguay still shackled and blindfolded (Report, 12 December). That wasn’t some effort to extract information. It was arbitrary and pointless cruelty. Kevin McGrath Harlow, Essex
