For years, the Cuban government maintained a large billboard facing the six-storey “US interest section” – the half-empty former American embassy – on Havana’s seafront, denouncing “Señores Imperialistas” for their bloody policies from Nicaragua to Iraq. The American diplomats inside what was a US embassy in all but name responded by running a giant electronic ticker from the upper windows, relaying news and anti-communist propaganda.
Within months of Barack Obama coming to power in 2009, the billboards were pulled back and the ticker disappeared. It was an early and visible sign that the new administration was prepared to consider a different path to the futility of half a century of isolation and embargos, and that the Cuban government was prepared to respond.
Creeping changes followed, from the easing of restrictions on Americans visiting family in Cuba and sending money to increased scientific and cultural exchanges.
But by the time Obama drew accusations of pandering to a dictator for going out of his way to shake Raúl Castro’s hand at Nelson Mandela’s funeral a year ago, the US and Cuba were engaged in a more far-reaching and secret effort to find a different path. The Vatican helped initiate the talks and finalise the deal. Canada, which Havana has used to bypass the blockade and is the source of a steady flow of tourists to Cuban resorts, hosted several rounds of negotiations.
Now the US interest section – which was built in 1953 but sat empty for years after the Cuban revolution until president Jimmy Carter re-established partial diplomatic relations in 1977 – is to return to its role as a full embassy with an ambassador and, no doubt, plenty of CIA agents.
The Obama administration did not need much encouragement to deal with the Cuban regime, especially since Raúl Castro had succeeded his brother Fidel in 2008 with promises of reform. There was widespread recognition that the embargo had, if anything, helped solidify, not weaken, communist rule in Cuba and that it was a policy driven more by US politics than a realistic prospect of bringing down Castro’s government.
Wayne Smith, the Carter administration’s chief of mission at the US interests section in Havana from 1979, was a vocal critic of the blockade, saying it accomplished nothing, and was a proponent of improved relations as the path to reform in Cuba.
But what the White House did need was secrecy, given the predictable hostility from Republicans – particularly in Florida with its large Cuban immigrant population – in the runup to last month’s elections.
After initial contacts between officials in Washington and Havana, the first face-to-face talks between American and Cuba were held in Canada in June 2013, with the Vatican smoothing the diplomatic path.
For the Americans, the principal obstacle to a public thawing in relations was the continued imprisonment of Alan Gross, a US citizen jailed for smuggling satellite communications equipment into Havana. The Cubans were pressing for the release of three spies held in the US for 15 years.
The archbishop of Havana, Cardinal Jaime Ortega, acted for Pope Francis in bringing the Cuban government along. As the talks progressed, the pope wrote to Obama and Castro urging each side to release the prisoners. It was a delicate issue for the White House, which had consistently denied that Gross was an intelligence agent and did not want to be seen to swap him for Cuban spies.
Havana saw it differently. Gross was arrested while working for a Maryland company that had a $6m (£3.8m) contract with the US Agency for International Development to smuggle equipment into Cuba that could circumvent controls on the internet. To the Cubans, the covert nature of Gross’s actions, and the fact that American government money was funding them, smacked of espionage.
Cuban officials felt equally aggrieved over the arrest in 1998 and jailing of five of its nationals on spying charges in Florida. The Cuban Five, as they became known, were intelligence agents sent to penetrate Cuban exile organisations, including armed groups, that Havana alleged were planning illegal and even terrorist acts against Cuba. The Cuban government said that once evidence was gathered it planned to deliver it to the FBI in the expectation that it would put a stop to the activities. It argued that the agents were not spying on the US.
Eventually a path was found that involved releasing others as well as Gross and the Cuban spies. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, met his Vatican counterpart, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, on Monday, although no public mention of the deal in the works was made. The agreement was finalised in a nearly hour-long call between Obama and Castro on Tuesday. The three remaining Cubans still in federal prison – two had served their time – were released. In return, Cuba freed a double agent.
At Washington’s insistence, Gross’s release was dressed up as a humanitarian gesture rather than part of a trade in spies. Cuba won a commitment from the White House to move towards removing it from the list of states sponsoring terrorism on which the Reagan administration placed Havana in 1982 for its support of liberation movements in Latin America. The White House described the pope’s personal involvement as “very important to the president”.
Now the thaw is out in the open, the Obama administration is keen to play it up as a “the most significant change in our policy in more than 50 years”, as the president put it. Democratic politicians hammered home the message that the embargo had failed and said the US had long ago lifted the embargo against Vietnam, a country it was once at war with. Kerry described US policy of the past five decades as “virtually frozen” and said it had “done little to promote a prosperous, democratic and stable Cuba”. “Not only has this policy failed to advance America’s goals, it has actually isolated the United States instead of isolating Cuba,” he said.
But Kerry and other officials also cautioned that the diplomatic shift is only a beginning and it will not change Cuba overnight. “This new course will not be without challenges, but it is based not on a leap of faith but on a conviction that it’s the best way to help bring freedom and opportunity to the Cuban people, and to promote America’s national security interests in the Americas, including greater regional stability and economic opportunities for American businesses,” Kerry said.
Talks on the normalisation of diplomatic ties are expected to begin within weeks. Then Kerry himself hopes to make history. “I look forward to being the first secretary of state in 60 years to visit Cuba,” he said.
