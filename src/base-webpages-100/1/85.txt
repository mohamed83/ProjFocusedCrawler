Mapping the Destruction of Typhoon Haiyan


Thousands of people are feared dead or missing after Typhoon Haiyan ripped across the central Philippines on Nov. 8. The storm’s massive surge is blamed for much of the destruction, particularly in Tacloban, where many neighborhoods were washed away.

Updates as of Tuesday, Nov. 12


Busuanga
The United Nations reported severe damage to housing and public infrastructure, and said that food and water would run out in two days.


Cadiz City
About 5,000 houses and nearly all corn and sugar crops were destroyed in the storm. The nearby city of Sagay was also severely damaged.


Leyte
An attempted hijacking of a convoy around 20 miles south of Tacloban forced it to stop, and by Tuesday night the roads were still too unsafe for the convoy to proceed.


Tacloban
Only small planes with limited capacity could use the Tacloban airport, and pilots flying in and out had to navigate by sight, slowing deliveries.


Guiuan
Early Tuesday, Philippine authorities delivered aid to the area, which had been without water or electricity since Friday. Nearly all of the municipality’s 50,000 residents are homeless.



 

 The Destruction in Tacloban
The typhoon decimated Tacloban, destroying many of the residential and commercial buildings in this once bustling city of 220,000. This map shows an estimate of damaged areas based on an initial survey of aerial and satellite imagery.

Buildings near the fish port were leveled by the storm surge, which sent water over half a mile inland in some places.

Homes all along the coast were completely destroyed. According to the Philippine census office, about one third of homes in the city have wooden exterior walls, and one in seven have grass roofs.
