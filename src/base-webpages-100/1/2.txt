             The Philippines: Typhoon Hagupit barrels through the country          








Packing winds of over 175 km/h, Typhoon Hagupit struck the Philippines' Eastern Samar province on Saturday evening – the same region that was devastated by Typhoon Haiyan barely a year ago. Ranked as a “super typhoon” while it was still over the Pacific Ocean, Hagupit – locally known as Ruby – had fortunately lost a bit of its intensity before making landfall, but the impact has still been very serious. With memories of Haiyan still fresh in local communities’ minds, over 700 000 people living in coastal areas left their homes to seek shelter in evacuation centres further inland, thereby limiting the loss of human lives. The full picture is still to emerge regarding the extent of damages, and the typhoon is still crossing the country, making multiple landfalls as it barrels across the archipelago in a north-western direction. But overall, it seems that better preparedness has been key to limiting the impact.
