Education


Plan has supported more than 44,000 children to return to school through the provision of ‘back-to-school’ kits, rebuilding classrooms, training teachers and supplying school equipment. Teachers in typhoon-affected communities are now better equipped to support children after an emergency and to help children to develop and learn from a young age.
More than 44,000 children resumed their education with ‘Back to school’ kits
2,226 ‘School in a Box’ and Teachers Kits supplied to schools
63 disaster-resilient classrooms built (another 137 planned)
86 damaged classrooms repaired (another 214 planned)
272 blackboards supplied to damaged schools
6,263 children reached by mobile Early Childhood Care and Development services
17 disaster-resilient daycare centres built (another 83 planned)
632 daycare workers trained in early childhood care and development techniques
205 Kindergarten teachers trained to support school-aged children who have not attended daycare to catch up on their early childhood learning and development
1,214 Elementary and Secondary School teachers trained on Education in Emergencies and Psychosocial Support 
Plan has worked with the Government of the Philippines to develop and improve on disaster-resilient designs for schools and daycare centres. The new schools and daycare centres being built are 3 times stronger than before and can withstand winds of up to 310 kph. The Government is now recommending that other NGOs also adopt these Plan-developed standards.
