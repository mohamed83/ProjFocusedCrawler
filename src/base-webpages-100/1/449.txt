Pope Francis says he will visit the United States in September 2015, his first trip to the country since becoming pontiff.
The pope said on Monday that he will travel to Philadelphia for the ‘World Meeting of Families’ – a Church-sponsored gathering that takes place once every three years.
Details have yet to be finalised, but Vatican sources say the trip will also include an address to the United Nations and a stop at the Mexico border, though it is yet unclear in which state – California, Arizona, New Mexico or Texas.
The organisers of the congress in Philadelphia say in a statement posted on the meeting’s website that the pope is expected to visit the city from 25-27 September for the closing days of the meeting.
He is due to attend two events in the city that will be open to the public – an “intercultural celebration of family life” on 26 September before holding a mass the following day.
