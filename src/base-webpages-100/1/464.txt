US-Cuba deal: a marriage 18 months in the making, blessed by Pope Francis









Nothing about the past year and a half, from the secret talks in Canada to the public handshake at Nelson Mandela’s funeral, happened by accident

If ever there was a lingering illusion that Barack Obama might have “accidentally” bumped into the president of Cuba at the funeral of Nelson Mandela last December, it will have vanished like a puff of cigar smoke.
What was purportedly an unscripted public handshake at that event in Soweto was, as it turned out, the culmination of six months of secret diplomatic talks held far away in Canada.
But it took another year, and the repeated intervention of no less a figure than Pope Francis, to get to a point where officials in Washington and Havana felt able to tell the world what was really going on – after a final phone call between Obama and Raúl Castro on Tuesday to seal the deal.
Then, like the Berlin Wall – that other great symbol of Cold War intransigence – something that had seemed a permanent fixture of US and global politics only hours earlier was suddenly crumbling before a stunned world.
The first indication that something was afoot were reports that a deal had been reached in which Cuba would free Alan Gross – a US government aid contractor accused by Cuba of being a US spy – on “humanitarian grounds”.
Then, in quick succession, Obama and Castro both announced they would address their respective nations.
The two speeches, broadcast simultaneously on split screens across the Americas, laid out the fruits of 18 months of talks. Gross was not the only prisoner to be released – Cuba would also release an unnamed US agent, as well as 53 political dissidents, and in return, the US would free Gerardo Hernández, Antonio Guerrero and Ramón Labañino, Cuban agents jailed for spying on anti-Castro groups in Florida.
And that was not all. Fifty-three years after US broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba, the two countries would move to restore them and reopen diplomatic missions, and the Obama administration would take steps to relax travel and commercial restrictions.

Cuba-US relations – timeline

Legally, Obama’s executive action allowing limited travel, commerce and diplomatic ties can only soften the edges of how the trade embargo is implemented – it will take Congressional approval to end the embargo altogether – but as Congress found to its cost after similar presidential moves on immigration reform last month, legislation is little use without enforcement.
More importantly, by taking things as far as he could without changing the law, Obama hopes to indirectly bring about political change in Cuba that will lead to a breakthrough in the stale debate back home – a paradigm shift which will force US politicians to rethink their skepticism at Castro’s ability to change – their opposition to a lasting reversal of sanctions. 
Peter Schechter, director of the Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council, a DC think-tank, made it clear the announcement marked the end of an era: “It’s the beginning of the end of US sanctions on Cuba,” he said.
As in the case of immigration reform, it is hard to imagine that the president could have acted unilaterally in this way until November’s midterm elections were out of the way. A crucial national security meeting at which US officials finalised their end of the plan was held in the White House bunker on November 6, two days after the polls closed.
Cuba has long been the third-rail of American politics; an untouchable issue that threatened to lose whichever party that touched it the support of Florida’s 29 electoral college votes in future presidential elections and unite hawkish Democrats and Republicans like no other country bar perhaps Israel. 
This president might not have to worry about elections any more, but his party does, and he needs the support of Congress on a host of other delicate foreign policy challenges such as similar attempts at rapprochement with Iran. 
But it also helps that Cuba is no longer the dangerous political issue it once was. Hardline Cuban exiles no longer hold the key to those votes: the old guard who once financed paramilitary raids on Havana harbour is dying out, younger Cuban-Americans with no direct relationship to the island cast their votes based on other issues and the Hispanics who’ve moved to Florida from Puerto Rico, Venezuela and elsewhere in Latin America now outnumber the Cubans in the state.
Shifting political realities across the region may also help explain Obama’s sudden political bravery: Obama and his officials emphasised the wider geopolitical ramifications of the deal. 
“Today, America chooses to cut loose the shackles of the past so as to reach for a better future – for the Cuban people, for the American people, for our entire hemisphere, and for the world,” he concluded in his speech.
Such high-flying talk is not just about polishing the Obama legacy. Taken together with his breakthroughs on immigration policy – which many in Central and South America had long felt treated Hispanics in the US differently to any other migrant group – Obama said he hoped his Cuban bombshell may help finally shift the prevailing view of US hypocrisy in the region.
Senior administration officials repeatedly stressed that they saw other Latin American nations in the hemisphere as key to pressuring the Cuban government to institute political reforms now that Havana could no longer point to Washington as the regional baddie.
“It has finally now taken the US out of the equation as a political issue,” Schechter says. “This is no small issue. It is time for people to see what Cuba is without hearing them use the crutch of the US as a big excuse.”
Cuba’s role in framing Latin America’s relationship with the US also helps explain why Pope Francis – the first Latin American pope – played such an important part in bringing the two sides together. Both the US and Cuban governments went out of their way to detail his extensive role behind the scenes.
Contact between the two sides gained vital extra momentum from letters the pope sent to Obama and Castro last summer. The Vatican said the letters called on the two countries “to resolve humanitarian questions of common interest, including the situation of certain prisoners, in order to initiate a new phase in relations”.
The Vatican also hosted delegations from Cuba and the US at what were said to have been the talks at which the breakthrough was made.
Papal officials were much more involved, according to the White House, than Canada had been in providing a neutral forum for talks previously. They were active facilitators and helped finalise not just the prisoner exchange but the wider normalisation of relations, according to a US source present at the meetings.
“The support of Pope Francis and the support of the Vatican was important to us, given the esteem with which both the American and Cuban people hold the Catholic Church, and in particular Pope Francis who has a substantial history in Latin America and is the first pope to be chosen from Latin America,” a senior administration official said.
Obama also discussed the issue at length with the pope during his public visit to the Vatican in March, where no other issue received more attention in their private discussions, according to US sources.
One of the few other world institutions as opaque and as powerful as the Vatican, the Central Intelligence Agency was also brought on side.
Opinions may have differed on the role of Alan Gross, who the US insists never had any espionage role, but all sides concede that a vital part of the deal was the release of the unnamed Cuban who spied for America – and who had been in prison for 20 years.
The agent has repeatedly been described by officials as one of the most significant “intelligence assets” in modern US history, and his release was described by the director of national security, James Clapper, as a “fitting closure to the Cold War chapter”.
Obama is determined that the pincer movement of economic modernisation and regional and spiritual cajoling will help bring about the longer-term breakthroughs in human rights and democracy that he concedes are largely absent from the existing deal so far.
It may be quick and irreversible like Eastern Europe or faltering and uncertain like Russia, but he hopes this change will be as much a part of his legacy as it was for Ronald Reagan.
But the real hope of change lies in Cuba. Its president spoke on Wednesday of building “a prosperous and sustainable socialism” in the wake of the deal.
The economic and cultural modernisation inside Cuba that the White House hopes will follow from the relaxation of US trade and travel restrictions is also important – such modernisation certainly played a role in destabilising the Soviet bloc – but it could just as easily lead instead to another China: an economically open but politically closed regime stubbornly clinging to its Communist past.
And the forces of economic change are limited. Americans travelling under certain regulations can bring back cigars from Havana for personal use, but without Congressional action there is no fat Cohiba yet for US industry. Something bigger and longer term will be needed first.
Whether this can be managed remains an open question: Florida senator Marco Rubio, a Republican who is the son of Cuban immigrants and a fierce opponent of “appeasement” of the Castro regime, looked on the verge of tears at a press conference on Capitol Hill as he railed against a deal he could do little to reverse.
Congress also remains to be convinced. House Democratic whip Steny Hoyer, a usually reliable ally, issued a statement late on Wednesday welcoming the prisoner exchange but questioning whether Cuba’s “brutal and repressive” regime was really ready to change.
“Today’s actions must be met with reciprocal steps by President Raul Castro’s regime,” he said. “Congress ought to do what it can to keep the pressure on the Cuban government to ensure that it begins to move toward greater democracy.”
At some point Obama will need lawmakers to finish the job and pull down the rest of the embargo if it is to have lasting effect. Now the president must hope that before he has to change minds in Congress, Cuba will have changed itself.
