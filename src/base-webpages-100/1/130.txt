Haiyan – known as Yolanda in the Philippines – is likely the strongest storm to form on the planet this year. “Based on satellite imagery, [Haiyan's] the strongest storm I’ve seen since Bopha (2012),” says Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with WeatherBell Analytics. Super typhoon Bopha, whose peak winds reached 175 mph, caused hundreds of fatalities on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao in December 2012. Maue says it’s possible Haiyan’s maximum sustained winds have reached 180 mph. “[The] system has developed to almost max intensity for a cyclone,” notes a NOAA bulletin. Officially, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center forecasts additional strengthening over the next day, but with the storm near its theoretical maximum strength – it’s more likely it has leveled off. As it continues westward over the Philippine Sea, its inner core may re-organize through what’s known as an eyewall replacement cycle, which would briefly weaken the storm. But water temperatures are very warm along Haiyan’s path, so significant weakening is unlikely.

The Wall Street Journal reports government agencies in the Philippines have been ordered to prepare emergency supplies and equipment ahead of the storm and will consider the need for evacuation procedures. Haiyan is the 11th typhoon to form in the west Pacific in the last seven weeks, during what the UK Met Office calls an “exceptionally active period.” It is the 5th super typhoon to form this year in the western Pacific.    2013 super typhoons (Brian McNoldy)  Wunderground meteorologist Jeff Masters notes Haiyan will be the fourth typhoon and fifth named storm to hit the Philippines in 2013. “The Philippines lie in the most tropical cyclone-prone waters on Earth, and rarely escape a year without experiencing a devastating typhoon,” Masters writes.

Typhoon Haiyan blasts the Philippines Residents of Bayog town in Los Banos, Laguna, south of Manila, walk along the beach amid strong winds from Typhoon Haiyan. The strongest Pacific storm this year — and possibly the most powerful ever to hit land — battered the central Philippines on Friday, forcing more than 700,000 people to flee their homes. At least four people had been reported killed by the storm, but the death toll is expected to be worse.  Charlie Saceda/Reuters  Buy Photo          Wait 1 second to continue.
