Super Typhoon Haiyan strikes Philippines

	Typhoon Haiyan has winds of 195 mph and gusts as high as 235 mph, according to the U.S. Navy’s Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Its strength is equal to that of an extremely powerful Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic. The storm is more than 300 miles wide and heading for a relatively dense section of the islands that make up the Philippines.  Read related story.
