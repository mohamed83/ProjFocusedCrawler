WFP Mobilises To Assist Philippines Government In Aftermath Of Typhoon Haiyan

MANILA – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is ramping up its operation in the Philippines, deploying emergency assistance to support the Government to help people affected by Super Typhoon Haiyan.

WFP officials joined a UN-Government assessment mission today to survey damage in Leyte and Samar provinces, and further teams are due to be deployed today. WFP is mobilising food stocks at its humanitarian response depots around the world.

	“The devastation we saw in Tacloban today was shocking,” said WFP Representative and Country Director Praveen Agrawal. “People have lost their homes and livelihoods, and the damage to infrastructure is substantial. Our thoughts are with the families affected by this terrible storm, and WFP is ready to assist in any way it can.”

	WFP has mobilised an immediate US$2 million for the response, but will be appealing for more funds as the needs become clearer. As a preliminary measure, 40 metric tons  of fortified biscuits are due to be flown in from Dubai in the coming days. High Energy Biscuits are often provided in the early days of a crisis as they are light to transport and do not need cooking. WFP is also looking at a range of other food commodities to stabilize the nutrition situation and meet immediate food needs.

	WFP’s emergency food stocks in-country are stretched as the organization has already been assisting people by the recent earthquake in Bohol, as well as those displaced by fighting in Zamboanga, in addition to regular operations.

	WFP is also working with the government to  boost logistics and emergency telecommunications capacity as required.
