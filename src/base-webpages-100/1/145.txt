Tweet

 






AmeriCares has been working with partners every day to help survivors of Typhoon Haiyan recover, rebuild and heal. With the help of our supporters, in the first 6 months after the storm, we've provided $19.7 million in medicines, supplies and health services to restore and protect the health of 1.3 million people. There is still so much more to do. You can help.
