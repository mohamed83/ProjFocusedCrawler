Emergency
On November 8, 2013, super Typhoon Haiyan – possibly the most powerful storm ever recorded—dealt a massive blow to the Philippines. Torrential rains, 15 foot storm surge and 150 mph sustained winds unleashed widespread devastation, power outages and landslides across the Visayas Islands. The storm affected an estimated 18 million people, killed over 6,000, displaced some 550,000 and damaged or destroyed as many as 2,000 health centers, hospitals and clinics.
Our recovery efforts continue to focus on the restoration and strengthening of health services and the repair and rebuilding of health facilities.  Click on the Response and Recovery tabs for details.






Response
Within 72 hours, our Emergency team was on the ground coordinating aid deliveries and assessing damage to begin our comprehensive response to save lives, restore health care, and build a more resilient health system for survivors.  Our response to date of $21 million in medical and humanitarian aid to partners working in the hardest hit areas includes:

$19 million in emergency medical aid: enough medicines to fill 1 million prescriptions and 1.3 million relief supplies including bandages, nutritional supplements, blankets and other medical supplies for hospitals and health centers in the hardest-hit areas, including $2 million to volunteer medical teams providing lifesaving care to typhoon survivors.
$1.1 million in emergency funding: for project support including the restoration of dozens of health care facilities, mental health training, and to procure relief supplies and humanitarian aid for survivors in need.

Click the Recovery tab to read an overview of our long-term recovery plan.

Recovery
AmeriCares will maintain a field presence in the Philippines into 2015, providing ongoing assistance.  We are currently working to build long-term, sustainable improvements in the health system and services:


Restore and strengthen health services: Supported medical teams caring for displaced survivors, transport urgent-care patients and provide equipment and supplies to re-open health centers.  We continue to supply health centers and work with community leaders and health officials to prepare for future emergencies.


Rebuild health facilities: Reconstruction completed or underway on 74 facilities with dozens more in the planning stages, restoring access to health services for close to 2 million patients. We are working with the Philippines Department of Health and local partners to rebuild health facilities to withstand future disasters. 


Building healthier futures for affected communities: Providing training to expand health workers’ skills in the areas of mental health and psychosocial support, malnutrition surveillance and disaster preparedness skills. We have already trained over 2,300 health workers and community leaders to provide mental health services to survivors facing trauma and loss after the deadly storm.  More than 2 million people now have access to improved mental health services.
