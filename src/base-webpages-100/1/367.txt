Typhoon Rammasun caused landslides and flooding along its path from the central Philippines to the northern peninsula of Bataan, passing just south of the capital city, Manila. Government rescue teams were trying to reach remote areas south of Manila affected by the storm, which packed winds of 90 miles per hour and gusts to 115 miles an hour. The one confirmed fatality as of Wednesday morning involved a woman being hit by a falling electric pole, officials said. Last November, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms on record, devastated the islands of Leyte and Samar on the east coast and killed more than 6,300 people.
