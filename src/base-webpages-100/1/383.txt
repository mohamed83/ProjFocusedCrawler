But the rapid response of American ships and planes after Typhoon Haiyan, amid a more chaotic Philippine response, has increased popular support for allowing the United States military to have more access.“We have a long history as an alliance, but also a complex history,” said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. “One event that gave momentum was the typhoon response.”The scope and timing of the agreement were still to be determined through further consultations, Mr. Medeiros said. He did not rule out the use of the Subic Bay site, which was one of the largest American bases overseas and a symbol of the American presence in the Philippines.Mr. Medeiros emphasized that the deal would not open the door to the re-establishment of American bases in the Philippines. Even so, given the political situation, it required eight months of negotiations.Correction: April 27, 2014An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council. He is Evan Medeiros, not Madeiros.Related CoverageListening Post: In Malaysia, Obama Works to Mend Troubled Ties Apr 27, 2014News Analysis: On a Trip That Avoids Beijing, Obama Keeps His Eye on China Apr 26, 2014ShareSaveShow Full Article                            xSharexEmailTwitterRedditGooglePermalinkhttp://nyti.ms/1tQEixjToolsSaveMore In WorldBelgium Confronts the Jihadist Danger Within The thwarted terrorist operation highlighted the dangers posed by a well-developed underground pipeline that has made Belgium the biggest per capita contributor in Europe of fighters to Syria.After Long Legal Fight, Inquest Is Set to Begin in Death of Putin CriticHearings will start this week in London on the 2006 death of Alexander V.
