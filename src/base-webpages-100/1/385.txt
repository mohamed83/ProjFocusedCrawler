In that case, Chinese ships fired water cannons at Vietnamese Sea Guard ships that had confronted the Chinese vessels, and both countries say the other’s ships rammed theirs.The fishermen who were detained by the Philippines face prison terms ranging from 12 to 20 years. They are being held on charges of violating wildlife protection laws.“They will remain in detention until the office of the provincial prosecutor has determined whether there is probable cause for the filing of formal charges,” Allen Ross Rodriguez, a government lawyer, told The Associated Press.The jailing of the fishermen came as Asian leaders were gathering in Myanmar for a regularly scheduled Asean meeting at which China’s increasingly aggressive territorial claims of maritime areas claimed by other countries are expected to be a major topic.
