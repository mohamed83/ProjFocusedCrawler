  Finding family in the Philippines

  Natural disasters, such as Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in the Philippines, create chaos and confusion. They often separate loved ones when they need each other most. The Canadian Red Cross Restoring Family Links Program helps people re-establish contact with their family members after separation in such circumstances.

  If you are seeking a family member in the Philippines please contact your local Canadian Red Cross office to confidentially discuss your request with a trained volunteer or staff member, or visit us online at: redcross.ca/familylinks.
   


 Super Typhoon Haiyan has brought widespread flooding, landslides and destruction to the Philippines, destroying thousands of homes as it tracked across the Visayas region of central Philippines on its path through the country.

 The storm, the worst typhoon to hit the country this year, made landfall early on the morning of November 8, with wind speeds of 300 kilometres an hour. It tore through Samar and Leyte in the Eastern Visayas before sweeping through Cebu in the Central Visayas. There are reports of buildings collapsing in Leyte, including a hotel, and specialist teams from the Philippine Red Cross are assisting with search and rescue.


 Strong winds and heavy rain have also battered the island of Bohol, which was devastated by a 7.2-magnitude earthquake three weeks ago. More than 270,000 people in the area are already living under tarpaulins and in makeshift shelters, and the extreme weather threatens to intensify the humanitarian emergency.


 The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has been working with the Philippine Red Cross as it prepared rapid response teams and supplies for those worst affected by the storm.


 Search and rescue teams are on standby and emergency supplies of blankets, sleeping mats, hygiene kits and water carriers have been sent from stores in Manila to a warehouse in Cebu ready for distribution in the coming days.


 The Canadian Red Cross is on stand-by with both personnel and supplies, including our field hospital, ready to be deployed quickly if requested.  To make a donation to the Typhoon Haiyan fund, click here.   Your support will help support Red Cross efforts in all countries affected by the storm.
