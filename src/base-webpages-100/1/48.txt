        COMMENTEMAILMORETACLOBAN, Philippines — Patrick Hennessy grew up near Syracuse, N.Y., loving to swim in Lake Ontario and the Oswego River. More than 60 years later, he used those long-dormant swimming skills to save his Filipino wife from the surging waves of a super typhoon.Hennessy, 74, and his wife Patsy, 54, were trapped in their kitchen a year ago as water rose from Super Typhoon Haiyan. He held up his wife to a small air pocket, her nose touching the ceiling, as his other arm treaded water to stay afloat.For a terrifying hour, Hennessy overcame his frail health and blindness." 'Just do one more stroke,' I said to myself, 'just do one more,' " he tearfully recalled last week in this eastern Philippine city, ahead of Saturday's one-year anniversary of the disaster that left more than 7,000 people dead and displaced millions.Patrick Hennessy, 74, with wife Patsy, 54, whose life he saved when they were submerged in their kitchen in Tacloban by super Typhoon Haiyan last November. His T-shirt has a popular slogan, Tindog Tacloban, meaning Stand Up Tacloban. (Photo: Calum MacLeod, USA TODAY)"I'm not a religious person," he said, "but it was definitely a series of miracles that I was able to hold her, although my strength was going," Hennessy said.USA TODAYSadness, smiles as Filipinos remember typhoonHennessy said he struggled for air each time he surfaced."It's OK to let go," Patsy Hennessy said she told him. "You always said you'd die happy in the water, and that's always been our dream to go together."But he replied: "It's not yet time."After the water finally subsided she again thought it might be time when she saw a poisonous snake floating near her husband's back."I just closed my eyes and prayed," she said. The couple will join the city and nation Saturday in acts of prayer and remembrance.A survivor prepares to launch candle-filled mini-boats made from sections of banana trees as residents commemorate the first anniversary of Typhoon Haiyan on Nov. 8. (Photo: Ted Aljibe, AFP/Getty Images)

The neighbor, Nelo Onida, employed Noel Baguion, 44, as his driver.As the wind strengthened, Onida suggested that the children sit inside his large pickup parked in the garage. "I thought the water would reach just 3 or 4 feet, the same as other typhoons," Onida said last week.Officials had warned of a "storm surge," but few people here understood that could mean tsunami-like waves, and many ignored pleas to evacuate coastal areas."I didn't want to put the kids in the car. I feared something terrible could happen," Arlene Baguion said. But her husband listened to his boss.The water swept the vehicle away, along with the Baguions' house. Noel Baguion found the truck an hour later and smashed open a window. Incredibly, their oldest son Vincent, then 9, was alive, his face pressed against an air pocket. But his two brothers had drowned, along with four other children and two adults in the vehicle.All 21 people who sheltered inside the Onida house survived.One year later, the two families still live just yards apart in a neighborhood bearing many signs of the devastation, but they no longer speak. After three months in a hot and crowded bunkhouse, the Baguions, who have four surviving children including Vincent, moved back to rebuild their hut.On Nov. 13, 2013, Vincent Baguion, 9, explains how he survived being inside a pickup full of sea-water by pressing his mouth and nose right against the roof, as his father, Noel Baguion, 43, listens. (Photo: Calum MacLeod, USA TODAY)Onida, a site engineer, renovates schools for a charity  and has hired another driver. He says he has no regrets about his actions last year, but promises to heed government advice next time and evacuate when a major typhoon barrels down on these storm-prone islands.The Baguions, who get by selling pineapples next to Palo Cathedral, say they also will flee if another storm hits. Vincent does well at school, but tenses up whenever there is wind and rain, his parents said."I cope by just making myself busy," Arlene Baguion said.
