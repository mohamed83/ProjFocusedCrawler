Stamford, Conn. – May 20, 2014 – Paul Gwyn Pagaran has joined AmeriCares as response and recovery coordinator, based in Manila, the Philippines. In his new role, Pagaran will oversee AmeriCares relief and long-term recovery efforts in response to Typhoon Haiyan. AmeriCares has been working on the emergency nonstop since the November 8 storm and is committed to the recovery efforts through 2015. AmeriCares is focused on repairing damaged health care centers and training health workers to recognize malnutrition and signs of depression in survivors.
“I'm excited to work with AmeriCares considering its focus on health programs and humanitarian assistance,” Pagaran said. “This experience will provide an opportunity to serve others and create a greater impact in addressing the health needs of the people affected by Super Typhoon Haiyan and in building resilience for future disasters.”
Pagaran brings nearly 20 years of experience in public health and disaster response, including working with the Philippine Red Cross where he most recently served as assistant to the secretary general and director for special concerns. Pagaran has tremendous experience in emergency response and recovery and NGO leadership, and has a deep understanding of the Philippine health care system. He is a nurse by training and has a master’s degree in public policy from the National University of Singapore and a Bachelor of Science in nursing from Manila Doctors College.
“We are thrilled that Paul Gwyn Pagaran is joining our Typhoon Haiyan recovery team. He is a respected leader with in-depth knowledge of response, recovery, and health care, particularly in the Philippines,” said AmeriCares Vice President of Emergency Response Garrett Ingoglia. “Over the next 12 months, we expect our team will make great progress in addressing long-term health needs of typhoon survivors, restoring and enhancing the health care system in affected areas, and improving the resilience of the health care system in the Visayas.”
