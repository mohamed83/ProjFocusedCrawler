Stamford, Conn. – Nov. 14, 2013 – Emergency medical aid for 20,000 typhoon survivors has arrived in the Philippines and AmeriCares has more aid on the way. A second air shipment of medicines and supplies is expected to arrive in the Philippines on Sunday. By next week, AmeriCares expects to deliver more than $1 million in medical aid and relief supplies for Typhoon Haiyan survivors.
“These initial shipments will help address widespread shortages of medicine and ensure medical professionals are equipped to treat survivors in the most devastated areas,” said AmeriCares Vice President of Emergency Response Garrett Ingoglia. “It will take months, even years, for the hardest hit areas to recover. These aid deliveries are just the beginning of a long-term response.”
AmeriCares has emergency response experts in Cebu and Manila coordinating aid deliveries to hospitals and clinics and assessing health needs. This weekend, AmeriCares relief workers will work with a partner organization to distribute food and emergency supplies, including 1,000 relief kits, in Basey, Samar province, and assess health needs in Roxas, Capiz province.
Super Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful storms on record, made landfall on the island of Samar on Friday with wind speeds up to 200 mph and a 15-foot storm surge. Some of the most severe damage was in Tacloban, where the city’s only functioning hospital is reportedly turning away injured patients.
AmeriCares has been aiding survivors of natural disasters, political conflict and extreme poverty around the world for more than 30 years, saving lives and restoring health and hope. AmeriCares has delivered aid to the Philippines since 1985 and supports an established network of 150 health care facilities, allowing it to quickly speed relief to disaster survivors. Over the years, the disaster relief and humanitarian aid organization has delivered more than $229 million in aid to the Philippines including relief supplies for survivors of last month’s deadly earthquake. Other recent emergency responses include Typhoon Bopha in 2012, Typhoon Washi in 2011, back-to-back typhoons in 2009 and Typhoon Frank in 2008.
