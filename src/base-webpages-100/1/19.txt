InterAksyon.comThe online news portal of TV5
MANILA - Residents of an isolated municipality devastated by Typhoon Ruby (international name: Hagupit) have resorted to using social media to seek help.Facebook user Amafel Bacuetes Veran (www.facebook.com/amafel.bacuetes), who lives in the Municipality of Pinabacdao, Samar, posted photos of wrecked homes and debris littered along the coastal area of Brgy. Calampong on Monday morning, captioning them with the words, "We need help."Quezon City-based student Divine Calban found the post on the Brgy. Calampong community page while searching for news about her grandmother and uncle, who live there.Other Netizens have been sharing Veran's post, but Calban took it one step further by tagging agencies that might be able to help."Many houses had been washed out and our house is one of those. We have been neglected because the media has not been able to reach us. The residents have been crowding inside a small church, which they turned into an evacuation center. I hope you can help them," Calban said in her repost.She was, nevertheless, thankful that none of the survivors had been hurt.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), on Tuesday, 2,269 families in Pinabacdao were supposed to have been preemptively evacuated to 28 evacuation centers on Thursday last week.As of Monday, a number of towns and municipalities in Samar were still experiencing power outages.The NDRRMC did not yet have a report on the delivery of relief goods there or of road-clearing operations."We are still having a difficult time contacting the people in our barangay because the mobile phone signal is too weak," Calban told InterAksyon.com in an online interview.After Brgy. Calampong was hit by strong winds and huge waves from 8:00 p.m. Saturday to 2:00 a.m. Sunday, she was finally able to get word from a friend on Tuesday afternoon.Calban added that Brgy. Calampong was a remote area, which was why it came as a big relief to find an online update on the residents' condition through Facebook."They really need food and clothes, as well as items they can use to sleep on. They also need donations so that they can repair their homes," she said. "Until now everyone we know in Manila is asking for help for their families back home in Calampong."
