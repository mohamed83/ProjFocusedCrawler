The American prisoner released by Cuba, Alan Gross, predicted in the spring that one way or another he would not spend another year in jail. His options appeared to be either release or death through hunger strike. Happily for Gross, it turned out to be the former.
Ever since his sentencing to 15 years in jail in 2011, Gross’s case had been seen by the Obama administration as a sticking point in improving relations with Cuba.
Arrested in 2009 while on a trip to the island aimed at delivering satellite telephone equipment, he was accused by the government in Havana of being a spy and convicted two years later of being part of a “subversive project of the US government that aimed to destroy the revolution through the use of communications systems out of the control of authorities”.
Speaking to reporters upon his return to the United States, Gross, in the new spirit of rapprochement, said he hoped that the US and Cuba would now move forward.
“Two wrongs never make a right. I truly hope that we can all get beyond these mutually belligerent policies and I was very happy to hear what the president had to say today,” he said.
Thanking Barack Obama for helping to facilitate his release, he expressed gratitude that he had not been forgotten while in jail, saying it had helped him get through the ordeal. “What a blessing it is to be a citizen of this country,” he said.
His patriotism did not appear to detract from his affection for the country in which he had been imprisoned. He said he retained the utmost respect and fondness for the Cuban people.
Gross was freed in a prisoner swap but the US government insisted it was not a case of spy for spy. There was a spy swap but the White House said Gross was never an intelligence operative and was not part of the exchange: his release was on humanitarian grounds.
The 65-year-old’s health had been detreriorating sharply since hearing of the death of his mother, and he had reportedly lost 100lbs in prison and begun losing sight in one eye.
The American was not the only person to be released as part of the landmark agreement. Also freed were three remaining members of the Cuban Five who had been imprisoned in the United States for spying on Cuban exile groups in Florida: Gerardo Hernández, 49, Antonio Guerrero, 56, and Ramon Labañino, 51.
In return, an unnamed Cuban, who had been a US informant and had been jailed in Cuba for almost two decades, was also released.

Gross had been a foreign aid worker, working on various projects in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. He had set up his own company in 2001 to spread telecommunications round the world, securing a contract with a US company to deliver equipment to Cuba. The company had a deal with USAID, the government development agency.
He made five trips to Cuba, helping to install the equipment. An avid supporter of Jewish causes, the equipment was put in place in Jewish centres round the island.
After his arrest, he sued the company that sent him for millions, saying he had not been properly informed about the risks involved. A settlement was eventually reached. His lawyer, after a recent visit to Gross in Cuba, described him as almost toothless and barely able to walk. He had been kept in a small room at a military hospital for 24 hours a day with two Cuban political prisoners.
Gross had refused medical or dental treatment and vowed to go on a hunger strike if not released by the end of the year.
In a statement released this month, Gross’s wife Judy said: “Enough is enough. My husband has paid a terrible price for serving his country and community.”
The three Cubans who had their sentences commuted had been in jail since 1998, being convicted in 2001 of being part of the Wasp Network spying on Cuban exiles in Florida on the orders of Fidel Castro.
Hernández had received two life sentences after being found guilty of conspiracy to murder in connection with the shooting down of a plane flown by the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue.
The two other members of the group – René and Fernando González – were released in 2012.
The Cuban Five insisted they were part of a miscarriage of justice because they were not targeting the US government but Cuban exiles bent on terrorism in their home island.
The Cuban government described their work as anti-terrorism.
The Cuban who had been working for the Americans and was part of the exchange had been in jail for almost two decades. He is said to have helped in identifying the Wasp Network and other alleged Cuban spies in the US.
The US director of national intelligence’s office said he had been of “critical assistance” in helping US investigators identify and convict Ana Belén Montez, a Defence Intelligence Agency official who spied for Cuba, and a state department official and his wife who had also spied for Cuba.
