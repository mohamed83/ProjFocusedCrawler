Typhoon Ruby/Hagupit









VIDEO: Typhoon Ruby as seen from the Int'l Space Station
(UPDATED) What does Typhoon Ruby (Hagupit) look like from space?

MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Ever wondered what a typhoon as violent as Ruby (internationally known as Hagupit) looked like from space?
On Saturday, December 6, while the Philippines prepared itself for Ruby's onslaught, the International Space Station passed above our little corner of the globe to capture the weather through their live Earth Viewing stream.

Taking advantage of this timely fly-by, YouTube user Earthspace101 took this short clip from the live stream. Even from space, the size of the storm is massive.
"The enormous size of the eyewall & outer rainbands is visible through the partial flyover; just east of the Philippines," the video's description says.
The scene looks serene from beyond the Earth's atmosphere, but the danger is true on the ground as the typhoon makes its way through several provinces.
In addition, astronaut Terry Virts took this photo of Hagupit as the International Space Station (ISS) flies past the country.

The storm is seen as viewed from the north, and as Virts noted in his tweet early Sunday, Metro Manila is seen in the foreground.
Stay updated with the latest weather conditions and prepare for any emergency through the Project Agos microsite. – Rappler.com
