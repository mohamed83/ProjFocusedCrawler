	IOM established its office in the Philippines in 1975. In 1986, IOM was granted privileges and immunities in the Philippines comparable to those of UN agencies. In 1988, the Philippines became an IOM Member State – among the first Member States in Asia, with Manila as one of the first regional IOM offices in late 1996.

	In 2003, IOM Philippines' privileges and immunities were updated for the then distinct entities of the MRF (Mission with Regional Functions) and MAC (Manila Administrative Center) – restating and retaining endorsement for programming and representation functions of the MRF and endorsing the internal service functions of the MAC.

	The Manila Administrative Centre provides global support in the areas of finance, human resources management, information technology, staff security, project tracking, and health claims processing, among others.

Improving Knowledge on Remittance Corridors and Enhancing Development through Inter-Regional Dialogue and Pilot Projects in South East Asia and Europe (with special focus on the Philippines and Indonesia). This project aims to promote the link between remittances and national development in South-East Asia (SEA) and provide support to the European Union's (EU) on going efforts to manage migration challenges and promote development in South East Asian (SEA) countries. This project began in 2007 and is on its last quarter of implementation.

	Key components of this project include:


		Comprehensive survey-based research studies on four remittance corridors namely Italy–Philippines, Netherlands–Indonesia, Malaysia–Philippines and Malaysia–Indonesia;

		The facilitation of Policy Dialogues for Italy–Philippines and Netherlands–Indonesia remittance corridors and

		Implementation of pilot projects to further strengthen the link between remittance and development in the Philippines and Indonesia.


	Pilot projects have focused on enhancing financial literacy among migrants and their family members in the Philippines and Indonesia while the project has also supported Indonesian diaspora in the Netherlands to form a diaspora development platform.

UNDP-Spain MDG Achievement Fund for Thematic Window on Youth, Employment and Migration. The Joint Programme on Alternatives to Migration: Decent Jobs for Filipino Youth developed by UN Country Team agencies ILO, IOM, UNICEF, and UNFPA and funded by the MDG Achievement Fund supports the Philippine government's vision of productive and competitive youth by 2010.

	The two expected outcomes of the Joint Programme are:


		Improved policy coherence and implementation on youth, employment and migration through full stakeholder participation, and

		Increased access to decent work for poor young women and men through public-private partnerships, more inclusive basic education and life skills, career guidance including on safe migration, vocational training, and entrepreneurship.


	The programme targets disadvantaged youth in provinces of high poverty incidence, high migration pressure and low school cohort survival rates, and where the Millenium Development Goals are least likely to be achieved, particularly Masbate, Antique, Agusan del Sur, and Maguindanao. IOM Philippines' specific role in this project will be to support the National Reintegration Center of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), through technical capacity building activities.

	IOM also aims to further enhance the link between migration and development through the establishment of mechanisms to provide more information on remittance corridors, policies, and realities, while also implementing activities to examine ways to channel remittances toward local and national development.

Emergency Transit Mechanism. In cooperation with the Philippine Government and UNHCR, IOM Philippines has finalized a Memorandum of Understanding establishing the Emergency Transit Mechanism in the Philippines, for refugees from other Southeast Asian countries, pending their onward resettlement to a third county. Upon receipt of approval for resettlement to a third country, IOM Philippines, in cooperation with UNHCR Manila, will assist in the finalization of travel arrangements and provide assistance on departure modalities.

Typhoon Emergency Response Programme. This programme began in September 2009 in response to a series of typhoons that struck the Philippines in the last quarter of 2009. In December 2010, IOM Philippines turned over the last batch of transitional shelters for displaced victims of Ondoy, also providing them with livelihood assistance.

	IOM Philippines in 2011 is turning its attention to areas affected by Super Typhoon Megi, which made landfall in the country in October 2010. Thousands of people, particularly in Isabela province were rendered homeless when their houses were totaly or partially damaged. The typhoon also destroyed harvests as well as fishing boats and nets critical to the local people's daily existence. IOM will provide shelter repair and livelihood rehabilitation support to these families who were most affected by Super Typhoon Megi.

The HAP is targeting about 447,213 conflict-affected persons in the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, North Cotabato, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Lanao del Norte.

	From previous emergency relief efforts, the HAP now focuses on long-term development programmes in Mindanao. IOM has submitted four projects which will allow IOM to continue assisting Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and return communities through construction of essential Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities and conduct of hygiene promotion activities; refurbishment of critical health facilities in the communities and conduct of health training and health kit distribution; provision of emergency shelter and livelihood and upgrading of basic community facilities in return communities; and strengthening of information management mechanisms for coordinate life-saving interventions.
