Water, Sanitation and Hygiene


Safe drinking water kits were amongst the life-saving items that Plan pre-positioned in several communities in the typhoon’s path. Within hours of the typhoon passing we had distributed kits to support 20,000 people to prepare safe drinking water, eventually reaching 225,000 people. Plan has also worked to reach 121 communities with critical hygiene and sanitation information, supporting this with the construction or rehabilitation of temporary and permanent water, hygiene and sanitation facilities, including 80 daycare centres and schools.
