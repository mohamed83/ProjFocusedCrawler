Aquino III of the Philippines said on Thursday.The statement by Mr. Aquino comes as China has been more aggressive in pushing its territorial claims in the South China Sea, having recently enraged Vietnam by placing an oil rig in disputed waters.Philippine officials said the Chinese ships were photographed from the air near the Gaven and Calderon Reefs, two areas of the Spratly Islands, a part of the South China Sea that includes reefs and islets claimed by China, the Philippines and Vietnam.“Based on the latest report that we have received, we are bothered that there seem to be developments in other areas within the disputed seas,” Mr. Aquino told reporters, speaking in Tagalog. “There appears to be movement of ships.”Video | Aquino on China’s Move in Disputed Seas President Benigno S.
