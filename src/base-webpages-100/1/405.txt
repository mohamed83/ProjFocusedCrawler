The raid on the syndicate’s locations in northern Bulacan Province on Thursday was a follow-up to an operation backed by Interpol in April in which 58 Filipinos were arrested, and 100 were linked to the extortion in a subsequent investigation in May. The victims were from all over the world, including a Scottish teenager who committed suicide after being blackmailed. Victims would be lured into cybersex on Skype and recorded, and a video link would be sent to their Facebook accounts unless they paid at least $3,000, said the leader of the police anti-cybercrime group, Gilbert Sosa.
