Philippines Typhoon Hagupit: Your Impact
December 8, 2014  By jlindner Leave a Comment A CRS shelter built after last year’s Typhoon Haiyan, shown here standing after Typhoon Hagupit. CRS is assessing and caring for some of the most vulnerable communities in the Philippines after Typhoon Hagupit. Most of these communities were effected by last year’s Super Typhoon Haiyan. Staff/CRS
As CRS is assisting the people of the Philippines with the recovery from Typhoon Hagiput, we are encouraged by how much of the rebuilding of the previous year — thousands of storm-resistant shelters — was able to withstand the storm. Between the our experienced staff on the ground and the infrastructure put in place through the outpouring of support since last year’s Super Typhoon Haiyan, the legacy of your generosity has been a new and growing resiliency.
We know from previous support during crises in the Philippines, an area prone to devastating natural disasters, the lifesaving difference your donations make. The following costs show the positive impact of your contributions:




$8 = 1 water kit


$15 = 1 emergency shelter kit


$22 = Household living supplies,



for a family, including a jerry can, pail and water purification tablets
with tarps and nails to use with local materials to create emergency shelter
including sleeping mats, blankets, utensils, plastics, glasses and cooking pot








$28 = Hygiene kits,



$30 = Income recovery,



a 2-month family supply of soap, detergent, toothbrushes, toothpaste, feminine products and towels
including seeds, tools and training for farmers to rebuild their assets and income
