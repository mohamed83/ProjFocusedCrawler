Crisis in South Sudan 

Nearly 4 million people remain in urgent need in South Sudan following the conflict that broke out in December 2013. Over 1.9 million people have fled their homes and are displaced within the country and over 479,000 have fled to neighboring countries. We have reached more than 360,000 people with life saving essentials, but we urgently need to reach more.  





 

Crisis in Syria 

More than three years after the beginning of the conflict in Syria the war shows no sign of abating. Massive numbers of refugees have fled conflict areas and are now living in inadequate shelter within Syria or in neighboring countries.

Oxfam assesses immediate needs of tropical storm Hagupit evacuees in SamarPublished: 8 December 2014 



They must be able to remain with dignity within evacuation centres, with the provision of food, water and sanitation facilities as well as privacy.


Justin Morgan 
Oxfam Philippines Country Director 



Oxfam rapid assessment teams have been deployed to survey the immediate needs of evacuees forced to flee tropical storm Hagupit, to ensure those who have lost their homes don’t lose their health as well.Working in with the International Organization for Migration in coordination with local government units, Oxfam today began visits to 20 of the 56 evacuations centers in the city of Tacloban, focusing on the need for clean water and sanitation.Country Director of Oxfam in the Philippines Justin Morgan said while many people had been able to return to undamaged homes, those not so fortunate remained vulnerable to further risks.“The successful evacuation of residents by communities and the government has saved lives. For those families not able to immediately return back home, they must be able to remain with dignity within evacuation centers, with the provision of food, water and sanitation facilities as well as privacy,” Morgan said.“Oxfam visited the areas where we work in Barangay 88, 89 and 90 in Tacloban and we’ve found many houses have suffered damage. There is a need to replace shelter materials so the population can make rapid repairs,” Morgan said.Tropical stormThe international aid agency has teams with expertise in water, health and sanitation, gender, protection and livelihoods on standby for further deployments. State weather agency PAGASA downgraded Hagupit’s classification from typhoon to tropical storm today as it weakened on its course to Luzon, but with heavy rain still predicted, the risk of flooding remains.“Oxfam is ready and willing to work with government and other humanitarian partners in ensuring the safety and dignity of any communities affected by Hagupit,” Morgan said. Contact informationFor more information, please contact Sarah Dransfield, Senior Press Officer, Oxfam, sdransfield@oxfam.org.ukTel: +44 (0)1865 472269Mob: +44 (0)7767 085636For updates, please follow @Oxfam
