Climate Change

Storm Warnings for Pope’s Climate Stop in the Philippines


				By Andrew C. Revkin 
January 16, 2015 5:12 pm

[Updated, 11:40 p.m. |  Pope Francis made it to Tacloban and, wearing a yellow plastic rain coat like those on the tens of thousands of people before him, delivered a simple and moving homily focused on assuaging people’s sense of loss. The transcript is here.]
Here’s the post as written Friday afternoon:
On Saturday, nearing the end of his visit to the Philippines, Pope Francis is scheduled to hold mass for residents of Tacloban City, which was devastated in late 2013 by Typhoon Haiyan (known as Yolanda in the Philippines). The Vatican has signaled that he will also talk about global warming.
If the stop comes off as planned, he’ll have a suitable backdrop in the form of high winds and downpours from Tropical Storm Mekkhala [now upgraded to a typhoon, as Jason Samenow reports], which is swirling in the Pacific nearby. The website Western Pacific Weather has the meteorological details.

The pope has been speaking out more about climate change of late, most recently in an exchange with reporters during his flight from Sri Lanka to the Philippines. Here’s the relevant moment, thanks to a transcript from the Catholic News Agency: 
Gerard O’Connell, America Magazine: …We have seen in Sri Lanka the beauty of nature, but even in the end the vulnerability of that island to climate change, etc. We are going to the Philippines, you are going to visit the stricken area. It is more than one year that you are studying the issue of ecology, of the cure of creation, etcetera. My question has three aspects. First, is climate change an outcome of the work of man, of man’s lack of care of nature? Second, when will your encyclical be released? Third, you insist – as we have seen in Sri Lanka – very much on cooperation among religions. Are you going to invite other religions to gather together to discuss this issue? Thank you.
Pope Francis: The first question, you had said a word that requires a clarification. Mostly. I don’t know if it’s all, but mostly, for a large part, man ‘slaps’ nature, continually, but we have taken hold of nature, of mother Earth. I remember – you already heard this – what an old peasant once told me: God always forgives, we men sometimes forgive, nature never forgives. If you slap it, it will always slap you back. Then, we exploited nature too much, with deforestations, for example. I remember [the 2007 meeting of Latin American bishops at] Aparecida; at that time, I did not understand this issue so much; when I listened to Brazilian bishops speaking about the deforestation of the Amazon, I never understood it in depth. The Amazon is the lung of world. Five years ago, with a human rights commission, I appealed to the Supreme Court of Argentina to stop, at least temporarily, a terrible deforestation in Northern Argentina, in the Norte de Salta area. This is one issue.
Then – I will say another one – the one-crop system – I will give two or three [examples]: Farmers know that if you make a cultivation of corn for three years, you have to stop, and then cultivate a different crop for one or two years, in order – I don’t know how to say it, nitrogenizar is the Spanish word for it – to regenerate the soil. Nowadays, for instance, there is the exclusive cultivation of soy; you take everything, you make soy until the soil is exhausted; not everyone does it, it is an example; many others don’t.
I think that man has gone overboard. Thank God, today there are voices and many people speaking out about this. But I would like in this moment to remember my beloved brother [Patriarch] Bartholomew, who has been speaking out about this for years. I read many things of his to prepare this encyclical…. The first draft was sketched by Cardinal Turkson with his staff.
[ACR: Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana has dealt with other contentious scientific issues – including weighing the role of genetic engineering in agriculture. In 2013, he threaded a path between industry and critics of genetically modified organisms, or G.M.O.s., saying they need to be used, but only with “the guidance of a deeply responsible ethic.”]
Then I took over the draft with the help of some people and worked on it, then I made a third draft with some theologians and I sent this draft to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, to the Second Section of the State Secretariat, and to the Theologian of the Pontifical Household, so that they could study it, and find if I had said some foolishness. Three weeks ago I received the responses, some of them this big, but all of them constructive. Now I will take a whole week in March to complete it, so at the end of March it should be completed, and will then be translated. I think that, if the work of translation goes well…, in June or July it will be released.
It is just important that there is some time between the release of the encyclical and the [climate treaty] meeting in Paris so that it may be brought there. Because the [treaty] meeting in Peru was not that much; it disappointed me, the lack of courage. They stopped at one point. Let’s hope that in Paris representatives will be more courageous.
The third [question]. I believe that dialogue among religions is important; this issue is felt by other religions as well, on this issue there is a common feeling. I have spoken with some representatives of other religions on the issue, and I know that Cardinal Turkson has, as well, and two theologians also; this was the path: it will not be a common declaration, meetings will come after.
If he gets to speak in Tacloban, I hope Francis recognizes how the scope of the social calamity in that coastal city was far more the result of deep poverty and poorly governed urban growth than any shift in typhoon patterns — which really haven’t changed at all in that region in recent decades. This graph shows the frequency of tropical cyclone landfalls:
PhotoA graph showing no change in patterns of tropical cyclone landfalls in the Western Pacific, from Historical Global Tropical Cyclone Landfalls, published in the Journal of Climate in 2012 and written by Jessica Weinkle, Ryan Maue and Roger Pielke, Jr. Red denotes major storms, blue major and minor.Credit 
There, as in so many places around the world, the prime driver of losses in severe weather calamities is poverty or settlement in danger zones.
Global warming, through sea-level rise, will raise odds of bad outcomes in such storms down the line even if warming has little impact on the storms themselves.
But for the time being, better governance and paths out of poverty are the prime priority in such places.
Family planning would help, too, and it was encouraging to see the Philippine Supreme Court approve a pioneering Reproductive Health Law last year.
As The Wall Street Journal reported just before the pope’s arrival, that decision has made it possible for the government to start providing thousands of families with access to contraception.
The Journal noted:
The Roman Catholic Church fought the measure, but many rank-and-file Catholics supported it as a way to reduce the country’s high birthrate and reduce poverty.
On his stop in Manila on Friday, while meeting with a thousand Catholic families, Francis made it clear that he was not shifting from longstanding Vatican policies against contraception.
The Catholic publication Crux reported:
The pope also issued a strong defense of Pope Paul VI’s controversial 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae, which upheld the Church’s traditional ban on birth control.
“He had the strength to defend openness to life at a time when many people were worried about population growth,” Francis said.
Take a strong stance on climate change is one thing. Changing a stance on population is another.

About

By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to pass nine billion. Those billions will be seeking food, water and other resources on a planet where humans are already shaping climate and the web of life. In Dot Earth, which moved from the news side of The Times to the Opinion section in 2010, Andrew C. Revkin examines efforts to balance human affairs with the planet’s limits. A Times reporter for 14 years, Revkin is the Senior Fellow for Environmental Understanding at Pace University's Pace Academy for Applied Environmental Studies. 
Conceived in part with support from a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, Dot Earth tracks relevant developments from suburbia to Siberia. Click for a narrated slide show on the roots of Revkin's journalistic journey.
