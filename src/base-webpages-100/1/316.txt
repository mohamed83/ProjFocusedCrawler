Medicines and medical supplies in AmeriCares Connecticut warehouse are readied for the Philippines. 







Stamford, Conn. – Feb. 12, 2014 – AmeriCares has $5 million in medical aid on the way to the Philippines to help Typhoon Haiyan survivors recovering from one of the most powerful storms on record. Two shipments containing pain relievers, wound care supplies and surgical supplies, as well as medications to treat diabetes and high blood pressure, left AmeriCares Connecticut warehouse today. The deliveries will help restock hospitals and health clinics treating survivors in the hardest hit areas and support a network of health care facilities throughout the country.
Typhoon Haiyan killed more than 6,000 people and affected 16 million people when it made landfall on Nov. 8. The latest deliveries bring AmeriCares total aid for the crisis to nearly $14 million. AmeriCares aid includes supporting partner organizations in the Philippines repairing 22 damaged health clinics.
“With an estimated 2,500 health facilities damaged or destroyed the health centers that survived the storm need our help to meet the demand,” said AmeriCares Vice President of Emergency Response Garrett Ingoglia. “We anticipate a year-long response to help the health system recover.”
AmeriCares has been delivering aid to the Philippines since 1985 and supports a network of 150 health care facilities across the country, allowing it to quickly speed relief to disaster survivors. Over the years, the disaster relief and humanitarian aid organization has delivered nearly $240 million in aid to the Philippines including relief supplies for survivors of the October earthquake and Typhoon Bopha in 2012.
