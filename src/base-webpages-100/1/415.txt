The Abu Sayyaf group released the two Germans, Stefan Okonek and Henrike Dielen, on southern Jolo Island, Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said. An Abu Sayyaf spokesman, Abu Rami, told the radio station DXRZ in southern Zamboanga City that his group received $5.6 million in ransom. He did not say who paid it. Mr. Gazmin said he was “not privy” to information about any ransom payment. Abu Sayyaf gunmen seized Mr. Okonek and Mr. Dielen last April from a yacht between Borneo Island and the western Philippine province of Palawan.
