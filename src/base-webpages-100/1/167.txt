Info


Shelter


Plan has assisted 195,000 people whose homes have been damaged or destroyed with temporary shelter or support to rebuild their homes. Another 87,000 received home items such as cooking equipment, blankets or sleeping mats to help with their recovery. Plan is working with communities to teach and apply disaster-resistant construction standards to recovery construction, ensuring that communities work together to build back better, stronger homes.
