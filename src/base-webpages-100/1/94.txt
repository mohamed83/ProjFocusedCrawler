On Friday, local meteorologists clocked gusts of 143 mph.Tens of thousands of families still live in tents and other flimsy shelters along coastlines that were battered in last year's storm.The Department of Social Welfare and Development said at least half a million people had fled their homes, and there were plans to move many more ahead of the approaching typhoon, which is known in the Philippines as Ruby.However, the U.S. advocacy group Refugees International said it was concerned that many evacuation centers might not be safe.lRelated

It comes very quickly and goes away again and comes back,” he said. “Sometimes it creates very small whirlwinds. And then the clouds are getting thick already and dark, and rains are pouring down and stop and then pour down again. It’s very abnormal.”Government officials and international aid organizations said they had learned lessons from Haiyan, which destroyed about 1 million homes, displaced 4 million people and left more than 7,300 dead or missing.

@edlewis9 You don't seem to have any idea what the economic situation is in the Philippines. I've known hundreds of people over the years out there... and earning about $20-50 a month seems to be the norm. Do you honestly believe that people would choose to live in a "paper...

“Nobody is taking any chances this time — not the government, the population or the international agencies," said Bradley Mellicker of the International Organization for Migration. "Everyone remembers what happened last year and are preparing to the greatest extent they can.”In Tacloban, Mayor Alfred S. Romualdez said he had suspended school and was encouraging workers from other areas to return home to reduce the city’s population to a more manageable level. Numbers swell from about 240,000 up to 1 million people during the workday, he said.Romualdez estimated that 95% of the people living in vulnerable coastal communities had relocated to evacuation centers.“They know because of experience that they don't want to get caught flat-footed and don't want to rely on outside help, so the best way is to prepare,” Romualdez said. “They are very attentive and monitoring the bulletins.” Unlike last year, rescue and debris clearance vehicles were moved to protect them from storm surges, and police and military reinforcements were deployed in advance, he said.To ward off looting, police officers were positioned at strategic check points and were patrolling the city’s central business district, where many banks are located.  A temporary liquor-sales ban was in effect.The city has set up backup communications systems and emergency coordination centers, Romualdez said. But with only propeller planes allowed to land at the Tacloban airport because of damage to the runway, there is still reason for concern if the city takes another direct hit. Mellicker of IOM said local authorities were preparing differently in Guian, another Haiyan-battered town.Although many buildings destroyed last year have yet to be rebuilt, people living in makeshift accommodations had been evacuating to “solid structures” for 48 hours, with the pace picking up on Friday, he said.“The whole peninsula is built of limestone, so many have evacuated into caves, which people have used for generations and always survived in,” Mellicker said.Richard Gordon, chairman of the Philippine Red Cross, said the organization is in “much better shape than last time.”  More relief supplies and personnel have been positioned, and more equipment has been purchased — including trucks, water tankers and satellite phones — which should improve response times.But he cautioned, “Even if you are ready, nature has a way of getting back at you and biting you in your behind, so you have to be ready for surprises.”Special correspondent De Leon reported from Manila and Times staff writer Zavis from Los Angeles.For international news, follow @alexzavis on Twitter Copyright © 2015, Los Angeles Times UPDATES6:23 p.m.: This story was updated with warnings that some evacuation centers might not be safe.This story was originally published at 3:45 p.m.
