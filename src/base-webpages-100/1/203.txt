15 November 2013: See the latest photos from Plan staff on the ground in Eastern Samar, the Philippines, as they respond to the needs of children and their families affected by Typhoon Haiyan.
With winds of over 310 kmh/195 mph, the storm devastated communities across the country - killing thousands and affecting over 9 million people.
Plan emergency teams are prioritising vulnerable children and remote rural communities with aid - including food, water, shelter and sanitation.
Please support our vital relief work and donate to the Philippines appeal
