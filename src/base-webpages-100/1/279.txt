Philippines Typhoon Haiyan appeal 




Typhoon Haiyan caused devastation when it hit the Philippines on 8 November 2013. Plan teams immediately provided emergency aid to thousands of affected families.
Plan supported more than 225,000 children and adults with vital drinking water kits.
Typhoon Haiyan destroyed homes across the country. Plan helped 195,000 survivors through temporary shelter or support to rebuild their homes.
More than 44,000 children resumed schooling thanks to back to school kits from Plan.
Plan's child-friendly spaces have provided protection and support to more than 21,000 children.
Now we need donors support to help communities build back better, safer and stronger with long-term programmes in education, livelihoods, child protection and disaster risk reduction. 



Thousands of people were killed when one of the largest storms ever to make landfall struck the Philippines on 8 November 2013.
Winds of over 310 kmh (195 mph) caused widespread devastation - destroying buildings, roads and livelihoods.
Thanks to generous support from donors, Plan emergency teams were able to provide life-saving aid in the immediate aftermath - including drinking water kits for 200,000 people, shelter for 195,000 and education support for 44,000 children.
Our teams are now working with affected children, families and communities to build back better and stronger - covering long-term needs in education, livelihoods, child protection and disaster risk reduction.
