The police had the house under surveillance for two months before the arrest.The United States has been helping in the fight against Abu Sayyaf for years, with a contingent of about 500 United States special forces troops stationed in the southern Philippines after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In the past decade, the number of Abu Sayyaf fighters has dwindled to fewer than 400, and the group has focused on kidnapping-for-ransom operations in pursuit of profit rather than ideology, according to Pacific Strategies and Assessments, a risk assessment group based in Manila.Khair Mundos, 50, a leader of Abu Sayyaf, was arrested in Manila.Philippines National Police / Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“The Abu Sayyaf group has largely degenerated into a mostly criminally oriented group,” the risk assessment group stated in a recent report.Mr. Mundos was arrested in May 2004, but he escaped from a provincial jail in 2007. His original conviction was for money laundering, related to arranging the transfer of the Qaeda funds.“Mundos confessed to having arranged the transfer of funds from Al Qaeda to Abu Sayyaf group leader Khadaffy Janjalani to be used in bombings and other criminal acts throughout the island of Mindanao,” according to a 2009 statement by the United States government in which a reward of up to $500,000 for information about him was offered. The statement added that Abu Sayyaf attacks had led to the deaths of citizens of the United States and the Philippines.In the Philippines, Mr. Mundos was wanted on multiple murder charges, the police said in their statement on Wednesday.Abu Sayyaf is one of the smallest yet most active militant groups in the southern Philippines. In the 1990s, the group was estimated to have as many as 1,000 fighters, and it staged some of the most high-profile kidnappings, bombings and other attacks in the country.In April 2000, the group kidnapped 11 Western tourists and 11 resort workers from a resort in Sipadan, Malaysia, and in May 2001, the group kidnapped 24 tourists from a beach resort on the Philippine island of Palawan.ShareSaveShow Full Article                            xSharexEmailTwitterRedditGooglePermalinkhttp://nyti.ms/SOwqOuToolsSaveMore In WorldBelgium Confronts the Jihadist Danger Within The thwarted terrorist operation highlighted the dangers posed by a well-developed underground pipeline that has made Belgium the biggest per capita contributor in Europe of fighters to Syria.After Long Legal Fight, Inquest Is Set to Begin in Death of Putin CriticHearings will start this week in London on the 2006 death of Alexander V.
