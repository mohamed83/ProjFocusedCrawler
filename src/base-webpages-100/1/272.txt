Eyewitness Reports After Typhoon in Philippines

Updated 3:30 p.m., Nov. 9 Dramatic images and video from local journalists and eyewitnesses show the extent of the damage in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, which  tore through the center of the Philippines on Friday. 
As my colleague, Floyd Whaley reported Red Cross officials estimated Saturday that more than 1,000 people were killed. But the death toll could rise as rescuers made their way to isolated parts of the three large island provinces — Samar, Leyte and Bohol —  which were all hard hit by the powerful storm known locally as Yolanda.
Writing on Facebook about Tacloban City, where hundreds of people are feared dead,  Josh Morgerman, a member of a storm chasing team, described an “utterly ghastly” scene during and after the storm. He and his two team members, including one man injured while helping rescue people, were able to leave Saturday by helicopter. 
First off, Tacloban City is devastated. The city is a horrid landscape of smashed buildings and completely defoliated trees, with widespread looting and unclaimed bodies decaying in the open air. The typhoon moved fast and didn’t last long– only a few hours– but it struck the city with absolutely terrifying ferocity.










Video footage from ICyclone, a team of three storm chasers in Tacloban City when the typhoon struck. 

Robert Mano, a radio reporter for the ABS-CBN Corporation,  shared multiple photos on Twitter as he made his way through the devastated Tacloban City.

Ritchel M. Deleon posted photos on Twitter of the debris-filled streets in Ormoc, on the island of Leyte, located in the path of the storm.

Ren Hechanova Liza’s video posted on Facebook  shows heavy damage near Ormoc. 
In Lingig, a town in the province of Surigao del Sur, Hernel Tocmo showed the effects of the storm surge, combined with the heavy winds, on homes.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, which has been posting regular updates on the typhoon, reported that it has weakened as it sped across the country into the West Philippines Sea toward Vietnam.

In hard-hit Tacloban, a city on the island of Leyte, Atom Araullo reported live during the storm for ABS-CBN, until communication problems made it impossible to continue.

Concern about Mr. Araullo’s safety prompted the television network to report hours later that he had made it through the storm.

Damage was also significant in Rojas, as can be seen in a video that Jackie Vee Sajise See posted on Facebook.
On Instagram, Jeff Canoy shared multiple pictures and videos from Bohol. 



On Leyte, local television footage broadcast by GMA in the Philippines showed the effects of the storm surge as floodwaters filled downtown streets.
