How we fight poverty 

The injustice of poverty demands a powerful and practical response to address both its causes and its impact on peoples' lives.

Crisis in South Sudan 

Nearly 4 million people remain in urgent need in South Sudan following the conflict that broke out in December 2013. Over 1.9 million people have fled their homes and are displaced within the country and over 479,000 have fled to neighboring countries. We have reached more than 360,000 people with life saving essentials, but we urgently need to reach more.  





 

Crisis in Syria 

More than three years after the beginning of the conflict in Syria the war shows no sign of abating. Massive numbers of refugees have fled conflict areas and are now living in inadequate shelter within Syria or in neighboring countries.

Blog: The art of saying "Thank you"7 February 2014We might feel aggrieved when we’ve gone out of our way to do something for someone and receive no word of thanks afterwards. I’m sure most of us have felt that way and have been equally guilty of failing to say ‘thank you’ at some time. But working as part of Oxfam’s emergency response team my colleagues and I don’t expect to receive any thanks from the people we work with. It’s our job and it’s their right to receive help during the worst of times - when a disaster has devastated their lives, families, homes, communities, countries. 

Blog: Philippines: Christmas after Typhoon Haiyan - rise up, stand up23 December 2013On Bantayan Island, North Cebu, I find a home made ukulele. When I play it the crowd of people around me start singing ‘We wish you a merry Christmas’. I’m not sure who’s the most surprised. Christmas is big in the Philippines. In Cebu City there’s a sign ‘The twelve weeks of Christmas’. They’re not joking. Christmas is normally the biggest event of the year, but this is not a normal year.

Blog: Philippines typhoon: In search of safe water to drink12 November 2013Oxfam's early assessment team has sent through this report from Cebu island, Philippines.
Meet the Mondejar sisters: Nelia, Sarah Jane and Rizza Mae. They are aged 10, 8 and 5 respectively. Next to them is their friend, Jennylyn Pepito, 6 years old. They are all housed in one of the classrooms of Daanbantayan National High School, which currently serves an evacuation center for 160 families on Cebu island.

Blog: The Philippines: Don't they know it's Christmas?24 December 2012In the Philippines, a strongly Catholic country, the first signs of Christmas appear months before the actual event: shops playing Christmas carols on their audio loops, brightly decorated trees, neon Santas and reindeers are colourfully displayed outside shops and plazas. It is hard to get away from the holiday over-load.
But in Compostela Valley province, on the southern Philippines island of Mindanao, there are no obvious signs that one of the most important festive and religious dates in the country’s calendar is just days away.
