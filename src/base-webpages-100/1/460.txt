As door opens to Cuba the sanctions versus engagement debate revives

The easing of US restrictions on Cuba will provide a telling case study in one of the longest running debates in foreign policy: whether sanctions or engagement represent the best way to change authoritarian regimes.
The argument for engagement made by the Obama administration is that greater interaction between Cubans and Americans through more dialogue, visits, trade and access to the internet, will inevitably soften Cuba’s state-run system. The restoration of bilateral ties will boost civil society groups, and cultivate a broader Cuban middle-class who can help drive political change.
The critics’ counter argument portrays the relaxation of the isolation policy as mere appeasement, a reward for the Castro regime despite its refusal to relax its grip on Cuban society or significantly improve its human rights record. They argue that economic benefits of the move will provide new lifeblood for the communist system.
“Every US dollar now flowing into Cuba is one less dollar the regime needs to worry about to keep their citizens’ heads above water. And the president’s actions have just opened the spigot further, even as Venezuelan aid continues to falter. Somewhere, Cuba’s geriatric generals are chuckling,” wrote Jose Cardenas, a conservative former official from the Bush era, in Foreign Policy.
However, even Cardenas conceded that 50 years of isolation had failed also to force any concessions from the Havana regime. Fidel Castro only stepped down from the presidency in 2008 because he fell ill, not because of outside pressure. His brother, Raúl, has made superficial economic changes but kept the essentials of one-party rule in place.
The conservative argument is that isolation should have been pursued until it succeeded; that the US was engaged in a battle of wills with Cuba and has just blinked. They point to the political reforms made in Burma and the dissolution of its military junta in 2011 as an example of the success of sanctions.
They also cite Vietnam as an example of a country that has not shown any real sign of democratic change despite being brought in from the cold in 1995 as US diplomatic relations were restored by America’s president Bill Clinton. The country is flagged up as a one-party state with a very poor human rights record.
Vietnam does indeed appear to be a weak advertisement for the policy of engagement. Human Rights Watch says: “The government suppresses virtually all forms of political dissent, using a broad array of repressive measures. Freedom of expression, association and public assembly are tightly controlled. Religious activists are harassed, intimidated and imprisoned.”
Counter examples to the Burma and Vietnam cases include countries such as Zimbabwe and North Korea, where ruthlessly authoritarian regimes have had many years of sanctions applied.
In the Cuban case, human rights improvements appear to have been sewn into the fabric of the biilateral deal. Fifty-three political prisoners have been released, while the authorisation for US telecommunications firms to operate in Cuba, coupled with Havana’s undertaking to increase internet access for its citizens, all represent human rights gains in themselves.
The US administration also points out that the punitive nature of US policy towards Cuba has proven to be a barrier to other Latin American states putting pressure on Havana out of a sense of solidarity. In the region, the policy has diplomatically isolated the US more than Cuba.
Whatever the political outcome the lifting of some of the financial constraints on Cuba will bring economic opportunities and improve the lives of many Cubans.
Put another way, the attempt to impose near total isolation on the island represented an act of collective punishment against 11 million Cubans that could no longer be morally or politically sustained.
