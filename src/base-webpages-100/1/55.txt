TYPHOON HAGUPIT

Typhoon Hagupit (known locally as Ruby) is battering communities in the Philippines with strong winds and heavy rainfall, and millions of people lie in its path.
Oxfam has positioned emergency supplies in key areas. We are coordinating closely with the government – poised to assess the needs and launch a response the moment we are called on.
Donate to the Typhoon Hagupit Relief and Recovery Fund now.
