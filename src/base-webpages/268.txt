A massive 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck near the Nepali capital, Katmandu, on Saturday, killed hundreds of people and caused extensive damage to buildings.
Tremors from the quake were felt in New Delhi, more than 200 miles away in neighboring India.
Nepal, , which sits on the boundary of the Indian subcontinent and the Eurasian tectonic plate, has a long history of earthquakes.Advertisement

Here’s a look at some of the worst earthquakes the tiny Himalayan nation has experienced:
Jan. 15, 1934 – One of the most devastating earthquakes in Nepal’s history, known as the Bihar-Nepal earthquake, killed more than 16,000 people from Nepal and India, according to the National Seismological Centre Nepal, and caused extensive damage to property and historic buildings, including the nine-story Dharahara tower in Katmandu. The 8.0-magnitude earthquake had its epicenter in eastern Nepal, about six miles from Mount Everest.

The tower was rebuilt, but on April 25, 2015 it was destroyed again by another earthquake.

July 29, 1980 – The 6.5-magnitude earthquake in the western region of Nepal killed more than a hundred people and destroyed thousands of buildings. The earthquake also caused a huge loss of livestock.
Aug. 20, 1988 – A 6.8-magnitude quake occurred near the Nepal-India border region. It killed more than a thousand people. Tremors were felt in large parts of northern India from New Delhi to the neighboring border of Burma and in much of Bangladesh.
1993 – A mild earthquake was felt that mostly affected the central and western regions of Nepal killing one person.
1994 – An earthquake occurred in the mid-western region of Nepal and injured scores of people and destroyed more than 80,000 buildings. No loss of life was reported.
2001 to 2003 – Low-magnitude earthquakes hit the mountainous nation in 2001, leaving two dead; in 2002 a quake injured more than 50 people and in 2003, an  earthquake left two people dead.
Sept. 18, 2011 – A deadly earthquake of 6.9 magnitude killed 16 people in Nepal and India.
UPDATE:  The epicenter of the quake was about 50 miles northwest of Katmandu, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which revised the magnitude of the quake down to 7.8 from an earlier estimate of 7.9.
This post has been updated to reflect the rising death toll.
