A joint Nepali-French search and rescue team pulled a 28-year-old man from a collapsed apartment block in the capital Kathmandu on Tuesday after he had spent around 80 hours in a room with three dead bodies.
 Rishi Khanal appeared to have had no access to food or water during his ordeal, which began at midday on Saturday when a 7.9 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal, destroying buildings and killing at least 4,600 people.

 “It seems he survived by sheer willpower,” said Akhilesh Shrestha, a doctor who treated him.
 Khanal had been on the second floor of a seven-storey building when the quake struck. The top floors were intact and the teams drilled down to him after he shouted for help and responded to questions in Nepali.
 The rescue took five hours. Doctors said he may have a broken leg.
