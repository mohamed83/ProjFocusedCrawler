Many of Kathmandu valley’s most historically important buildings have been destroyed in the earthquake that struck on Saturday, killing more than 4,000 people. But heritage experts say glimmers of hope remain.
The Dharahara, a 60-metre white minaret tower built in in 1832 has been destroyed, while the Kasthamandap, a three-storey wooden temple in Durbar Square, has also been reduced to piles of wood and rubble.
“It is not as famous as the tower, but historically it is perhaps the most significant building in Kathmandu that has gone,” Prof Michael Hutt, director of the South Asia Institute at Soas and author of a book on the art and architecture of Kathmandu valley, said of the Kasthamandap, which gives the city its name.

Hutt said he was “in mourning” after spending the weekend following events on news websites and on Twitter. “The first picture I saw was the Kathmandu Durbar Square and the first impression was one of total devastation.”
Two of the square’s most imposing pagoda temples have also been destroyed, but as more pictures were posted online it became clear that some historic shrines and temples had survived the disaster.
Kathmandu valley has three main cities – Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur – each built around rambling medieval palace complexes and each with a public square containing shrines and temples.

Hutt said: “You’ll have a square with 10 or 12 of these 17th-century structures and three or four of them will have collapsed completely, and a few of them will be badly damaged or cracked or the top finials will have fallen off but a number of them seem to be surviving. Looking at pictures of the main palace complexes, they’ve got bits fallen off and sections collapsed but, by and large, they have survived.”
It is too early to know the extent of the loss, though it would appear four of the seven Unesco world heritage sites in the valley have been severely damaged.
But experts are hopeful that some buildings can be restored and point to the example of the Dharahara Tower, reconstructed after earthquakes in 1833 and 1934.

As well as historic buildings, Kathmandu valley has lost a lot of housing dating to medieval times, which is more difficult to replace. “That stuff is coming down pretty fast anyway,” Hutt said. “People don’t want to live in it and there is not a government there which enforces conservation orders. It is quite a regular feature in the Kathmandu valley to see someone demolishing a gorgeous old half-timbered building and replacing it with a concrete monstrosity. This is going to hasten that process and it is rather sad.”

Bhaktapur has retained more of its medieval character, and, while the quake has inflicted heavy damage, some important buildings are still standing, including one of two five-tiered temples.
Hutt said Patan was home to the most spectacular palace and square, as well as an exquisite museum, which appears to have survived the disaster, though several pagoda temples have fallen.

He expressed relief that the death toll in the area was not higher. “The damage and loss of life in the valley, even though it’s awful, is not quite the cataclysm some of us may have been fearing. It is dreadful, but Kathmandu valley may have got off lightly.”
The most pressing concern, of course, is the humanitarian crisis. In time there will be an assessment of what historic buildings have been lost and whether they can be rebuilt. “Rebuilding is going to be a huge task. I hope to see it in my lifetime but it is going to take a while, and that is assuming the funds are made available to Nepal, because Nepal does not have the money to do it by itself,” he said.
“It is a desperate place politically: very fragile, poorly resourced and heavily dependent on international aid. The resources are not there to do this restoration work and they are going to need a lot of help.”

Prof Peter Stone is chairman of the UK National Committee of the Blue Shield, a cultural heritage equivalent to the Red Cross, albeit one entirely reliant on volunteers. 
He said many of his international colleagues were trying to coordinate an action plan in response to the disaster, but it has been proving difficult. “The problem we face in Nepal is that we have no idea if those people are still alive … and we have no way of getting in touch with them in a quick, easy way.”
The immediate priority is search-and-rescue, but “much quicker than many people realise, the local community will want to restabilise itself. People will want to re-engage with what they see as normality,” Stone said. “The past becomes far more important because it is a touchstone of normality.”
