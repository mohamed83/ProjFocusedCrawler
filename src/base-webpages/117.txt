The two land masses are still colliding, pushed together at a speed of 1.5 to 2 inches a year. The forces have pushed up the highest mountains in the world, in the Himalayas, and have set off devastating earthquakes.Experts had warned of the danger to the people of Katmandu for decades. The death toll in Nepal on Saturday was practically inevitable given the tectonics, the local geology that made the shaking worse and the lax construction of buildings that could not withstand the shaking.GeoHazards International, a nonprofit organization in Menlo Park, Calif., that tries to help poorer, more vulnerable regions like Nepal prepare for disasters, had noted that major earthquakes struck that region about every 75 years.In 1934 — 81 years ago — more than 10,000 people died in a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in eastern Nepal, about six miles south of Mount Everest. A smaller quake in 1988 with a magnitude of 6.8 killed more than 1,000 people.Map | Maps of the Damage From the Nepal Earthquakes  Maps show the landscape of temporary shelters, the epicenter of the earthquake and its aftershocks.Brian Tucker, president and founder of GeoHazards, said that in the 1990s, his organization predicted that if the 1934 quake were to happen again, 40,000 people would die because of migration to the city where tall, flimsily built buildings would collapse.In an update just this month, GeoHazards wrote, “With an annual population growth rate of 6.5 percent and one of the highest urban densities in the world, the 1.5 million people living in the Katmandu Valley were clearly facing a serious and growing earthquake risk.”The organization helped set up a local nonprofit to continue preparations, including the reinforcement of schools and hospitals.Saturday’s earthquake occurred to the northwest of Katmandu at a relatively shallow depth, about nine miles, which caused greater shaking at the surface, but at magnitude 7.8, it released less energy than the 1934 quake.Photographs | Nepal’s Historic Sites, Before and After the Earthquake  The earthquake that struck Nepal on April 25 flattened sections of Katmandu’s historic center, where many structures were made with bricks.Roger Bilham, a professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado who has studied the history of earthquakes in that region, said that the shaking lasted one to two minutes, and the fault slipped about 10 feet along the rupture zone, which stretched 75 miles, passing under Katmandu.The earthquake “translated the whole city southward by 10 feet,” Dr. Bilham said.Aftershocks as large as magnitude 6.6 have occurred mostly to the northeast of Katmandu.It is possible that the Saturday quake is a preface to an even larger one, but Dr. Bilham said that was unlikely.Katmandu and the surrounding valley sit on an ancient dried-up lake bed, which contributed to the devastation. “Very, very soft soil, and the soft soil amplifies seismic motion,” Dr. Tucker said.Steep slopes in the area are also prone to avalanches like the one that the quake triggered on Mount Everest on Saturday.Katmandu is not the only place where a deadly earthquake has been expected.Dr. Tucker said Tehran; Haiti; Lima, Peru; and Padang, Indonesia, were similarly vulnerable. In those places, nearby tectonic faults are under strain, and building standards and disaster preparations are seen as inadequate.But not everywhere has been complacent. Over the past 76 years, many earthquakes have occurred along a fault in northern Turkey, starting in the eastern part of the country and progressing west, toward Istanbul. An earthquake in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people, mostly in the city of Izmit, east of Istanbul. The expectation is that the epicenter of the next big earthquake will be in or around Istanbul.“Istanbul is the place that has been most aggressive in enforcing building codes,” Dr. Tucker said. “I think Istanbul has been doing a good job.”Related CoverageNepal Terrorized by Aftershocks, Hampering Relief Efforts Apr 26, 2015Earthquake Devastates Nepal, Killing More Than 1,900 Apr 25, 2015Everest Climbers Are Killed as Nepal Quake Sets Off Avalanche Apr 25, 2015ShareSaveShow Full Article                            xSharexEmailTwitterWhatsappGoogleRedditLinkedInPermalinkhttp://nyti.ms/1z6ckDXToolsSaveMore In ScienceIndian Subcontinent’s Quake-Causing Collision CourseGeologists have conflicting theories as to why India is still on the move, up to two inches a year, and why it has crashed into Eurasia.The DebunkerA Weak Handshake Is Not Necessarily Bad News for Your Heart5:01 PM ETA recent study found lower hand grip strength was correlated with a higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, but it didn’t say anything about handshakes.When Birds Squawk, Other Species Seem to ListenA professor’s hunch is that birds are saying much more in warning of danger than previously suspected, and that other animals have evolved to understand the signals.Back to topMain MenuHomeHomeWorldU.S.U.S. NewsPoliticsU.S. PoliticsThe UpshotNew YorkBusinessBusinessBusiness DayTechnologySportsSportsOpinionOpinionScienceHealthArtsArtsStyleStylePhotosVideoMost EmailedTimes PremierMore SectionsAutomobilesBlogsBooksFoodFoodFoodEducationMagazineMen's StyleMoviesMusicMedia & AdvertisingObituariesPublic EditorReal EstateSunday ReviewGreat Homes and DestinationsT MagazineTelevisionTheaterTimes WireTravelWeddingsWomen in the WorldCorrectionsRecommendationsSavedSettingsEdition:Type Size:AAANight Mode:Account:SubscribeLog inDownload Our AppsNYTimesNYT NowNYT Real EstateCrosswordDownload the NYTimes appHelpSubscribeFeedbackTerms of ServicePrivacy© 2015 The New York Times Company
