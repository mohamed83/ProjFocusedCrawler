"Prime Minister Koirala will soon visit India to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss matters relating to rehabilitation and reconstruction works in the country on long-term basis," Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Local Development Prakash Man Singh told PTI.The Prime Minister has already received an invitation from the India government for the visit, he said.
The premier will visit India at an "appropriate time", he said, without giving any specific date. Mr Koirala has been in regular contact with his Indian counterpart in the aftermath of the April 25 disaster that completely damaged as many as 5,00,000 houses and partially damaged 3,00,000 others.
The premier told local and foreign journalists in Kathmandu yesterday that Prime Minister Modi was the first to call him after the May 12 quake and that India has provided help for rescue and relief works hours after the quake hit the Himalayan nation.
"We got good support and help from India. In fact, India was the first country to come to the rescue of our people and extend logistic and other necessary support. We are very much thankful to our neighbouring countries India and China for that," the Prime Minister said.
India has provided at least 15,000 tonnes of relief materials, including tarpaulins, to Nepal to tackle the crisis brought upon the country by the deadliest temblor in its recorded history that struck on April 25.
Indian Air force airlifted hundreds of people from dangerous areas to safe places and rescued about a dozen people from earthquake-hit places.
The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu has also organised 'langars' or food camps besides medical camps at various places to help the quake-affected people.
Indian Ambassador Ranjit Rae is visiting various earthquake-hit areas to inspect the rescue and relief works being carried out by the embassy, an Indian Embassy spokesperson said.
The government has estimated damage caused due to the earthquake to be around USD 10 billion. It has announced to establish a fund of Rs 200 billion for which it has committed Rs 20 billion as seed money.
For the remaining amount, the government is seeking help from various donor countries, including India.RelatedAir India's Mental Health Test for Pilots Runs into TroubleIn Poll-Bound Bihar, Politics Over Compensation for Earthquake VictimsAir Force Chief Arup Raha Leaves for US on 4-Day VisitStory First Published: May 18, 2015 18:44 IST        British Parliament Reconvenes After Conservative VictoryIslamabad's Benazir Bhutto International Airport Upgraded with Blast-Proof WallALSO READAir India's Mental Health Test for Pilots Runs into TroubleNepal Prime MinisterSushil KoiralaNepal earthquakeKathmandu earthquakeIndian Air forceIndian Ambassador Ranjit Rae................................
