Samser Sherpa with his two sons at a relief camp in Kathmandu, Nepal. Mr. Sherpa survived the 7.8 quake that rocked Nepal last month, but was injured in Tuesday’s quake
Preetika Rana/The Wall Street Journal


KATHMANDU, Nepal—It took Samser Sherpa more than two weeks to work up the courage to return to his hometown in the mountains of eastern Nepal.
When last month’s 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck, he watched helplessly as friends and neighbors there were killed by a rockslide. Mr. Sherpa and his family escaped unharmed from that disaster, which left more than 8,000 people dead.
On Tuesday, Mr. Sherpa wasn’t as lucky. He had just ventured inside his house to look for his children’s clothes when another big quake hit, causing the structure to collapse on top of him, breaking both his arms and his left leg.Advertisement
“I thought, ‘everyone is going to die this time,’ ” Mr. Sherpa said.
A series of fresh quakes Tuesday, including one with a magnitude of 7.3, killed 79 people and injured more than 2,000 others, fraying nerves and setting back relief work in a country struggling to recover from one of its worst natural disasters in a century.
