12/41A powerful earthquake struck Nepal Saturday, killing at least 686 people, as the violently shaking earth collapsed houses, leveled centuries-old temples and triggered avalanches in the Himalayas. It was the worst temblor to hit the nation in over 80 years. This is before and after pictures of the historic Durbar Square in Nepal. Photo: AP/PTI






 

13/41One hundred and eighty one people have died in Kathmandu, the Nepal government has said. Thirty people have died so far in neighbouring countries, over 20 in India.






 

14/41The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.9 struck before noon and was most severely felt in the capital as well as the densely populated Kathmandu Valley. 






 

15/41A magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit about an hour later, and smaller aftershocks continued to ripple through the region for hours.






 

16/41Deaths have been reported from all parts of Nepal except the far west. All security personnel have been deploywed to rescue and assist those in need, national police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam told AFP.






 

17/41An official from Nepal's mountaineering department said bodies of eight people have been recovered on Mount Everst after the massive earthquake triggered an avalanche. Gyanendra Shretha said an unknown number of people remain missing or injured.






 

18/41Earlier the country's Home Ministry had said one Chinese citizen was killed on the border, two in Bangladesh and six in Tibet in the quake. Dozens of people with injuries were being brought to the main hospital in central Kathmandu.






 

19/41Pushpa Das, a labourer, ran from the house when the first quake struck but could not escape a collapsing wall that injured his arm. "It was very scary. The earth was moving... I am waiting for treatment but the (hospital) staff is overwhelmed," he said, gingerly holding his right arm with his left hand. 






 

20/41The earthquake also shook several cities across northern India, and was felt as far away as Lahore in Pakistan, Lhasa in Tibet, and in Dhaka, Bangladesh.






 

21/41Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a meeting of top government officials to review the damage and disaster preparedness in parts of India that felt strong tremors. 






 

22/41The states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Sikkim, which share a border with Nepal, have reported building damage. There have also been reports of damage in the northeastern state of Assam.






 

23/41China said two of its citizen was killed at the Nepal-China border. Television reports from Bangladesh said 2 people were killed and about 100 injured. The Tibetan government said six people were killed in Tibet.






 

24/41A senior mountaineering guide, Ang Tshering, said an avalanche swept the face of Mt. Everest after the earthquake, and government officials said at least 30 people were injured.






 

25/41Tshering of the Nepal Mountaineering Association said the avalanche apparently occurred between the Khumbu Icefall, a rugged area of collapsed ice and snow, and the base camp where most climbing expeditions have their main camps. (backslash)






 

26/41While details are unclear with communications limited to the Everest region, Tshering said the avalanche did not appear to have hit the base camp itself.






 

27/41The quake's epicenter was 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu, and it had a depth of only 11 kilometers (7 miles), which is considered shallow in geological terms. The shallower the quake the more destructive power it carries.






 

28/41As the ground began to shake, several buildings collapsed in the center of the capital, the ancient Old Kathmandu, including centuries-old temples and towers, said resident Prachanda Sual.






 

29/41Among them was the Dharahara Tower, one of Kathmandu's landmarks built by Nepal's royal rulers in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument. It was reduced to rubble and there were reports of people trapped underneath.






 

30/41The Kathmandu Valley is densely populated with nearly 2.5 million people, and the quality of buildings is often poor.






 

31/41While the extent of the damage and the scale of the disaster are yet to be ascertained, the quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this poor country best known for Everest, the highest mountain in the world. 






 

32/41The economy of Nepal, a nation of 27.8 million people, is heavily dependent on tourism, principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.






 

33/41Robin Trygg, a climber, was in a basecamp on the Cho Oyu mountain at an altitude of 5,600 meters (18,480 feet) when he felt the quake. "We were sitting in the tent and drinking tea when all of a sudden the earth began shaking. We didn't understand what happened," he told the Swedish news agency TT by telephone.






 

34/41In Kathmandu, dozens of people were gathered in the parking lot of Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses were spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some wearing hospital pajamas.






 

35/41The U.S. Geological Survey revised the magnitude from 7.5 to 7.9 and said the quake hit at 11:56 a.m. local time (0611 GMT) at Lamjung. It was the largest shallow quake since the 8.2 temblor off the coast of Chile on April 1, 2014.






 

36/41An earthquake's power increases by 10 times with each increase in the number of its scale. A magnitude 7 quake is capable of widespread and heavy damage while an 8 magnitude quake can cause tremendous damage.






 

37/41People rest on the debri at the royal square. It housed the old royal palaces and was a recognised as a UNESCO world heritage site. 






 

38/41A rescue worker attempts to remove the debris at a site to retrieve a dead body.  






 

39/41Rescue workers look for trapped victims under a collapsed building in Kathmandu.  






 

40/41volunteers work to remove the debris at  the site of the historic Dharahara tower, which collapsed after the earthquake. 






 

41/41An injured child receives medical attention outside a hospital at Kathmandu. The hospitals have reached capacity and tratment is being offered at the yards.
