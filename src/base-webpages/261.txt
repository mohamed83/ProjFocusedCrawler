Though urban residents can protest loudly about their hardships, the most pressing needs are in isolated villages in remote valleys and mountainsides, where the earthquake caused devastating landslides. Prime Minister Sushil Koirala said on Tuesday that the number killed could reach 10,000.“Our primary, primary, primary goal is to rescue the people,” the official, Brig. Gen. Jagadish Pokharel, a spokesman for the Nepalese Army, told a group of reporters after a briefing on the aid effort. “We are also trying to synchronize it and to distribute to the needy people. We will do our best.”For a government fractured by political rivalries, juggling the demands of distressed citizens could become more difficult if the clean water and other aid fail to flow faster in coming days and blunt public frustration.“The bureaucracy has been a bit slow, but they did seem to get organized in the past 24 hours,” Jamie McGoldrick, the United Nations resident coordinator for Nepal, said in a telephone interview.Video | After Nepal Earthquake, Funeral Rites Survivors bury the dead after last Saturday’s earthquake in Katmandu, Nepal.“We’ve got camps with a population we will need to support for the much longer term,” he said. “The material is getting out there, but this is a massive operation.”The hub of the earthquake relief effort in Nepal is the Tribhuvan International Airport on the outskirts of Katmandu and the adjacent domestic terminal and military quarters. Planes from India, China and other countries have been landing with supplies of water, food, tents, stretchers, medicines and other aid.In the military operations section of the airport, Nepalese officers in mottled fatigues coordinate arrivals of supplies and operate helicopters rescuing badly injured victims of the earthquake from far-off areas. The supplies wait in a warehouse and hangar until civilian government officials allocate them.“We brought in close to 30 tons of drinking water yesterday,” Wing Cmdr. S. S. Birdi, a spokesman for the assisting Indian Air Force, said in an interview at the airport military operations center. “What’s happening is people are all facing hardship, but the people in the remote areas are in much more hardship.”Map | Maps of the Damage From the Nepal Earthquakes  Maps show the landscape of temporary shelters, the epicenter of the earthquake and its aftershocks.Many Nepalese people have voiced suspicion that much of the assistance has not been shared fairly, or at all, because of incompetence, poor planning or corruption.Hundreds of Nepalis, mostly young men, gathered outside the National Parliament in Katmandu on Monday, chanting in anger at what they said was the government’s slow and inept response to the earthquake, including a lack of safe drinking water.“They have not given anything,” one of the protesters, Sajjwal Chaulagain, a 20-year-old student, said in an interview. He and others echoed the widespread belief that the foreign assistance was plentiful and being hoarded by officials.“This is the corruption and laziness in government,” said Sudip Thebe, a business student who joined the protest. “We look at the news, and every country gives us something, but the Nepal government doesn’t give to us.”Video | Fear and Limbo in Katmandu Since Saturday’s earthquake, tens of thousands in Katmandu have slept outside, wary of aftershocks and the threat of collapsing buildings.Not all Nepalese people were angry with the government, and many spoke of their hardships in weary resignation. “I’m angry with being here, but the government is trying,” said Kabin Joshi, a 20-year-old trainee lab technician staying in one of the camps for residents. “We need more help; that’s a fact.”Some relief organization workers said delivering help to villages devastated by the earthquake was a physical challenge that would test any government. The office of the United Nations’ resident coordinator in Nepal on Monday cited estimates that the earthquake had affected eight million people in the country, including two million in the 11 worst affected districts. About 1.4 million of them needed help with food.“The geography is very, very difficult,” Peter Oyloe, the director for nutrition for Save the Children in Nepal, said in a telephone interview. “Trying to deal with geography, trying to get to those people, the most vulnerable especially up in the high mountains, is very difficult.”In Katmandu, with over a million inhabitants, most residents have been able to find enough to eat, and many people return to their homes to pick up food and perhaps cook a meal. By Tuesday, more shops had reopened, making it easier for residents to buy supplies.But safe drinking water has been more difficult to find, especially for poor residents, after the earthquake fractured pipes and tanks, introducing potential dangerous contaminants.The Nepalese Army has been making a more visible effort to improve people’s conditions in at least some tent camps in Katmandu.On Tuesday at Tundikhel, a parade ground near the center of the city that has been turned into a tent camp, Col. Prayog Rana oversaw soldiers handing packets of cooking oil to women. The soldiers have also built more toilets and cleaned the campsite, which holds 6,000 residents, and they were setting up tanks of disease-free drinking water, he said.“I want to organize this place in a very systematic way,” Colonel Rana said, watching soldiers shepherd the women and children into lines. “But so far there are not the resources.”Chris Buckley reported from Katmandu, and Austin Ramzy from Hong Kong.Related CoverageAcross Nepal’s Countryside, Desperate Journeys to Ruined Homes After Quake Apr 28, 2015Nepal Villages Cut Off by Earthquake Wait for Aid as Death Toll Passes 4,000 Apr 27, 2015A Scene of Destruction After Ice Thunders Into Everest Base Camp Apr 27, 2015Google and Facebook Help Nepal Earthquake Survivors and Contacts Connect Apr 27, 2015ShareSaveShow Full Article                            xSharexEmailTwitterWhatsappGoogleRedditLinkedInPermalinkhttp://nyti.ms/1zjfnstToolsSaveMore In WorldBoko Haram Militants Raped Hundreds of Female Captives in NigeriaFormer captives of the group told of being raped, many repeatedly, in what officials described as a deliberate strategy to possibly create a new generation of Islamist militants.Ebola Cases Rise in Guinea and Sierra Leone After Steep Drop3:35 PM ETOfficials at the World Health Organization said that there had been a nearly fourfold increase during the most recent week of reporting, to about 35 new cases.Pakistani Investigators Raid Offices of Axact, Fake Diploma CompanyAfter a report by The New York Times, Pakistan’s interior minister ordered the inquiry into the company and hundreds of school websites linked to it.Back to topMain MenuHomeHomeWorldU.S.U.S. NewsPoliticsU.S. PoliticsThe UpshotNew YorkBusinessBusinessBusiness DayTechnologySportsSportsOpinionOpinionScienceHealthArtsArtsStyleStylePhotosVideoMost EmailedTimes PremierMore SectionsAutomobilesBlogsBooksFoodFoodFoodEducationMagazineMen's StyleMoviesMusicMedia & AdvertisingObituariesPublic EditorReal EstateSunday ReviewGreat Homes and DestinationsT MagazineTelevisionTheaterTimes WireTravelWeddingsWomen in the WorldCorrectionsRecommendationsSavedSettingsEdition:Type Size:AAANight Mode:Account:SubscribeLog inDownload Our AppsNYTimesNYT NowNYT Real EstateCrosswordDownload the NYTimes appHelpSubscribeFeedbackTerms of ServicePrivacy© 2015 The New York Times Company
