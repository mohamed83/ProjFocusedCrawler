These pictures capture in excruicating detail the rescue of a man buried alive by the earthquake.
 
 This man's picture went viral - making him the 'face of the quake'. Agencies
 

 
Seventeen  bodies have been recovered at the base camp on Mount  Everest where  hundreds of climbers are stranded after an earthquake in  Nepal on  Saturday triggered an avalanche on the world's highest peak, a   mountaineering official said.
The first helicopter took off  from Kathmandu on Sunday morning to  airlift the injured after flights  were delayed by cloudy weather, Ang  Tshering Sherpa, president of the  Nepal Mountaineering Association,  told Reuters. At least 61 people were  injured.
The avalanche swept down Everest, burying part of the  base camp as  climbers gathered near the main route to the summit at the  beginning of  the climbing season in the deadliest incident on the  mountain.
US climber John Reiter said dozens of people had  suffered critical  injuries, many of them with head injuries. "It's been a  rough 18  hours," he told CNN.
An Indian army spokesman said  earlier a climbing team found 18  bodies on Saturday in the first hours  after the quake. Nepal's Tourism  Ministry could only confirm 10 deaths,  but spokesman Gyanendra Shrestha  said the toll could rise.
One  of those killed was Dan Fredinburg, a Google engineer based in   California. He suffered head injuries when the avalanche hit, according   to a statement from the mountaineering company that had taken him to   base camp.
"We pray too for all those who have lost their  lives in one of the  greatest tragedies ever to hit this Himalayan  nation," Jagged Globe  said.
Tourism ministry officials  estimated that at least 1,000 climbers,  including about 400 foreigners,  had been at base camp or on the ascent  to the peak when the earthquake  struck.
April is one of the most popular times to scale the  8,850-metre  (29,035 foot) peak before rain and clouds cloak it at the  end of May.  Almost exactly a year ago, an avalanche killed 16 Nepali  guides in what  was the single deadliest day on the mountain.
Saturday's  7.9-magnitude quake was the strongest to hit Nepal for 81  years. It  also shook neighbouring India, China and Bangladesh. Early  on Sunday,  the official death toll stood at more than 1,800 people in  Nepal.
Nick  Farr, an Australian climber of The Everest Academy and Trek  Climb Ski  Nepal, said efforts to find out the situation at base camp  were being  hindered by poor phone coverage.
"Nothing is being received out of there at the moment," he said.
Steve  Moffat, a mountain guide and operations coordinator for New   Zealand-based Adventure Consultants, said two Nepali staff had been   killed when the avalanche tore through base camp.
A further 31  staff and climbing clients - including two from the  United States, five  from New Zealand and one each from Australia, Italy  and Iceland - were  safe but stranded at Camp 1, further up the  mountain.
"The  first stage and the first priority is to get them down to base  camp. We  don't know if it's going to be possible to get them down and  out through  the Khumbu Icefall or whether we will need to chopper them  out," Moffat  said from New Zealand.
Climbers above Everest base camp all safe

There  are around 100 climbers at camps 1 and 2 on Mount Everest,  above base  camp, and all are safe after an earthquake set off an  avalanche, the  head of the Nepal Mountaineering Association said on  Sunday.
It  will be difficult to evacuate the climbers as the route back to  base  camp through the Khumbu icefalls is blocked, Ang Tshering Sherpa  told  Reuters.
The avalanche that swept through parts of base camp  had the combined  force of two separate snowslides from different peaks,  Sherpa said,  and blanketed the camp in powder snow. Seventeen bodies  have been  recovered and 61 climbers were injured.
Earlier reports:
Death and panic on Mt Everest
Climbers on the world's highest mountain pleaded for help on Saturday after a massive earthquake triggered an avalanche at Everest base camp.
Base camp was crowded with foreign mountaineers and their sherpa teams at the start at the climbing season when the avalanche hit, destroying camps and sending slabs of ice crashing in what was described as a "huge disaster".
"Running for life from my tent. Unhurt. Many many people up the mountain," tweeted Romanian climber Alex Gavan who had been preparing to ascend nearby Lhotse, the world's fourth highest peak.
"Huge disaster. Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap," he later tweeted.
'Destroyed by the shake' 
"Many camps have been destroyed by the shake and wind from the avalanche. All the doctors here are doing our best to treat and save lives," Sherpa said.
"Big slabs of ice" hanging near camp two, further up the mountain from base camp, came crashing down after the earthquake, with poor communications compounding fears for climbers there.
"We had some 10 to 15 climbers including some sherpas up there and we still don't have any confirmation reports (of) whether they are OK or not," climber Arjun Vajpai told India's NDTV.
"It is snowing here for the past one and a half days. We haven't been able to establish radio communication with them," he added.
Some 700 climbers are in Solukhumbhu district that includes Everest, with 300 thought to be at base camp itself, and another 300 just below, deputy superintendent of police Chandra Dev Rai said.
Another climber Daniel Mazur, from SummitClimb, tweeted that base camp "has been severely damaged" while his team was caught at camp one. "Please pray for everyone."
He later tweeted to say that we "have no damage and are all safe".
