A British national is among the dead following a 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal last weekend, according to the UK Foreign Office.
The victim, who was said to no longer live in the UK, was confirmed dead on Wednesday after searches by diplomatic staff in the country. Officials were in touch with the family, the FCO said.
Dozens of Britons are still missing in Nepal after the tremor on Saturday morning, with the official death toll exceeding 5,000. It could end up doubling still, Nepalese authorities fear. The confirmation of the first British death in the country will test the nerves of those still awaiting news of their loved ones.

The development came amid mounting criticism of the FCO’s help for those caught up in the crisis, with reports claiming that in some cases foreign governments had evacuated their people while leaving Britons behind. 
Several Britons trapped in the Langtang valley, a popular trekking spot north of Nepal, had been able to get in touch with their families, but relatives say the FCO has done nothing to help them.
