Nepal has been hit by another strong earthquake, sending people in the capital Kathmandu rushing out on to the streets just weeks after a devastating quake killed more than 8,000 people and destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes.
 The first earthquake caused devastation in the capital city of Kathmandu and triggered an avalanche at Everest, injuring and wounding many people. 
 Shockwaves from the second quake were felt as far away as the Indian capital, Delhi, and Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. 
 As the government and aid groups continue their efforts, we’d like to hear from those who have been affected by the earthquake. Perhaps you live in Nepal, have family members who have been affected or are part of the rescue mission. Are you involved in organising part of the relief effort in the country or from home? 
 Share your photos, videos and stories and we’ll use your submissions in our reporting. 
You can share photos and stories by clicking on the blue ‘Contribute’ button on this article. You can also use the GuardianWitness smartphone app or the Guardian app and search for ‘GuardianWitness assignments.’ If you’d like to share your photo via Instagram, you can do so by using #GuardianWitness. And you can email us at guardian.witness@guardian.com
