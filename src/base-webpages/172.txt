Despite this, in 2014 only 1% of humanitarian funding was spent on education and there is no mechanism to fund emergency measures to ensure that those who are worst affected get back into school as quickly as possible.

School is where children can get life-saving information. I have met many children who are distressed by what they have witnessed, and going to school is a welcome return to their normal routine.

Photo: Children play in the grounds of badly damaged Kshamwati higher secondary school in Susma Chhemawati, Dolakha.Jagat Thami, a father of two, says: “The primary school in the village collapsed and we can’t use it now. The children just play among themselves in the road. It would be helpful to have some spaces where they can go, but the school and the grounds are badly damaged so it’s not safe to play there or to go back to study.”
