Biography

 



Volunteers help with rescue work at the site of a building that collapsed after an earthquake in Katmandu, Nepal, Saturday, April 25, 2015.
Associated Press


The magnitude-7.8 earthquake that hit Nepal on Saturday was the result of an ongoing collision between tectonic plates that has caused some of the region’s deadliest temblors, including the 2005 Kashmir quake that killed more than 80,000 people.
Along the southern border of Nepal is the so-called Indus-Yarlung suture zone, where what is now the Indian subcontinent collided 40 million to 50 million years ago with the Eurasian plate, a region that includes most of Europe and Asia.
The collision created the Himalayan mountain range, the peaks of which are still rising by around one centimeter a year as a result.Advertisement
As the India plate pushes its way northward into Asia, stress and pressure builds up at the point where the two landmasses meet. When that pressure becomes too much, one landmass slides under another, releasing a shockwave that we call an earthquake.

Saturday’s earthquake was magnitude 7.8.
Magnitudes are calculated from the ground motion recorded on seismographs.
The scale is designed such that an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 produces a seismic wave 10 times larger and releases 31 times more energy than that of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0, for example. 
By way of comparison, when a portion of the Burma plate was thrust under the India plate off the western coast of Indonesia in 2004, the resulting Indian Ocean tsunami was produced by a magnitude-9.3 earthquake.
But size isn’t the only measure of an earthquake’s potential for destruction. The depth at which it occurs is also important. The closer the epicenter of the quake to the surface, the more the impact is felt above ground.
Earthquakes that occur within 70 kilometers of the surface are considered shallow, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Saturday’s quake in Nepal occurred 15 kilometers below the surface, according to the agency.
Where an earthquake occurs also matters.
Underneath the Katmandu Valley is a 300-meter-deep layer of black clay, the remnants of a prehistoric lake, which amplifies the damage caused by severe earthquakes, according to a 2004 study by the Netherlands-based International Institute for Geo-information Science and Earth Observation. As a result, the region is prone to soil liquefaction in strong earthquakes, when vibrations can cause solid ground to turn in to something akin to quicksand, swallowing buildings.
