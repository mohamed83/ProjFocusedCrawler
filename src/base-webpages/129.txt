For this week's stories from the field look out for new posts below (we're adding the most recent information at the top).

Her 7-year-old daughter was killed as a result of the earthquake. 42-year-old Budhu Maya is mourning her 7-year-old daughter killed in the Nepal earthquake.Your donations are helping us get aid to women like Budhu. We've already delivered food, medicine and shelter to her village - Ichok village in Sindhupalchok district. We can't ease the pain of losing her daughter. But we can support her to survive during this terrible time.Please help us support more women like BudhuFri 8 May 15.41: We've just heard that we have now supported approximately 48,520 people with immediate relief items (e.g. food, hygiene kits, medicines, shelter materials and protection centres) across Kathmandu valley, Sindhupalchok and Kavre districts.We're really proud of and grateful to our incredible staff and volunteers on the ground who have been working around the clock to buy, coordinate and distribute this aid. Considering many of them have been personally affected by the earthquake their dedication to helping others is all the more remarkable.Their hard work means that families like these in Talamarang village who lost their homes now have a tent to sleep under at night.Families from Talamarang village now have a tent to sleep in thanks to ActionAidBy the end of May we plan to have reached 77,000 people in total. And we're already preparing for how to support these communities to rebuild their lives in the long term.As you can see, all your donations really are making a difference to the people of Nepal. If you haven't donated yet, or would like to donate again, please do.Support our emergency response now.Fri 8 May 13.44: This is Karuna Pathak collecting her rice and other food provisions that our teams have brought to the rural mountain community of Kot Danda. Kot Danda is a small farming community at the very top of a mountain - a 45-minute drive out of Kathmandu. Until we arrived they hadn't received any assistance from other aid agencies. We've now delivered food, plastic sheeting for waterproofing shelters and tents.To help us reach more communities in Nepal please donate now. Karuna Pathak collecting her food such as rice provided by ActionAid in Kot Danda, Nepal.Getting aid to remote areas like this can be very challenging. The bags are heavy, making it tiring loading and unloading trucks. The roads through the mountains can be treacherous and when our teams get there they often have to carry the bags on foot for long distances to reach the places where people are staying.Porters come to collect aid we delivered to Mahanka village in Sindhupalchok district, Nepal. Thur 7 May 12.54: We're getting reports that an increase in child trafficking in Nepal is a real fear right now. Young girls and women who have been made homeless by the earthquake are vulnerable to gangs who lure them to India with the promise of jobs, but then force them into unpaid labour or sex work. You can find out more about Nepal's child trafficking problem on our blog. Young girls playing outside the tent where they've been living since the Nepal earthquake struck their home in Khokhana We're calling on the Nepali government to enforce trafficking laws and deal with vulnerable people humanely.

We're helping people rebuild their lives, which will make them less vulnerable to traffickers.Thur 7 May 11.32: Kanchi, 45 lost her house and cattle (which were her main source of food) to the earthquake in Ichok village in Sindhupalchok district.

We drove through the aftershocks for over an hour to get to the hospital."Shakhu with her one-week-old baby girl, who was born during the earthquake Shakhu went on: "I don’t know what I would have done if the hospital wasn’t here. I would have been stranded. I probably would have died and my baby too. When I got to the hospital the nurses and doctors helped me a lot. At first they gave me medicine to help my labour, but in the end I had to have an emergency cesarean. Thankfully my baby is fine, which makes me relieved. They saved both our lives."I haven’t named my baby yet.  She will be named 12 days after her birth as is tradition. Our family are already thinking she should be called ‘Lucky’.”We've pledged £50,000 to Patan hospital in Lalitpur District, south of Kathmandu, for medical supplies and equipment for an operating theatre which could be used for maternal support.
