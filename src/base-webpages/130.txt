Where we’re delivering aid in Nepal:   Mon 4 May 20.11: These are the people your donations are helping. The incredible Sushila. When the #NepalQuake hit she was in a field but ran to her house & saved her children. #Nepal pic.twitter.com/ZyAVmu1xrs— Tom Allen (@geecologist) May 4, 2015 A huge thank you to everyone who has donated so far to help people in Nepal. Thanks to your generosity we've already reached 26,800 people in some of the worst-hit areas with emergency supplies.  Karuna took my arm & insisted on thanking everyone who's helping, especially those donating. So => Dhanyabad! #Nepal pic.twitter.com/zck9OnLizF— Tom Allen (@geecologist) May 4, 2015 Mon 4 May 12.40: Shakhu's baby is 7 days old. She was born during the earthquake at Patan Hospital in Kathmandu. Shakhu told us:"I was on my way to the hospital when the earthquake started. I had already gone into labour about 40 minutes before the ground started shaking. Buildings began falling around me and the roads were cracking. The car began to shake. I was terrified because I thought I was going to die. We drove through the aftershocks for over an hour to get to the hospital.""I don’t know what I would have done if the hospital wasn’t here. I would have been stranded. I probably would have died and my baby too. When I got to the hospital the nurses and doctors helped me a lot. At first they gave me medicine to help my labour, but in the end I had to have an emergency cesarean. Thankfully my baby is fine, which makes me relieved. They saved both our lives."I haven’t named my baby yet.  She will be named 12 days after her birth as is tradition. Our family are already thinking she should be called ‘Lucky’. "We might name her Lucky" says mum of baby born during the #NepalEarthquake #NepalQuake pic.twitter.com/zGCoSQJkh7— Natalie Curtis (@NatalieCurtis) May 4, 2015 Shakhu told us: "My home has been destroyed. We can’t live there now, so will stay with my sister in law after I leave the hospital. But after that I’m not sure what we will do. I’m worried and afraid that I have no home to take my baby to. I want a good future for my baby. I want to be able to give her a good life".ActionAid has given Patan hospital £50,000 to pay for medical equipment and medicine for a new operating theatre. This will help with surgeries including cesareans and other life-saving operations. One week after the earthquake, the staff at Patan hospital had delivered 160 babies, including 45 cesarean births. If you would like to help pregnant women and new mums like Shakhu, please donate to our appeal.Mon 4 May 11.15: We're on our way to Kavre today to deliver aid with the help from these volunteers. Youth volunteers at @ActionAid #Nepal, safety briefed and ready to help on our relief distribution in Kavre today pic.twitter.com/CFmqDxBFQo— Tom Allen (@geecologist) May 4, 2015 Sun 3 May: 20.07: Today we delivered food (rice, salt, dahl, sugar and oil) to support 7,000 people for 15 days in Mahankal and Ichwok, in Sindhupalchok district.Sun 3 May 16.16: Up to 90% of the houses in Gorkha and Sindupalchowk districts have been destroyed.

Team *very* happy!— Tom Allen (@geecologist) May 3, 2015 Sun 3 May 14.48: Thousands of pregnant women are without care in Nepal. Many are giving birth in appalling conditions without basic medicines or support. We've pledged £50,000 to Patan Hospital in Kathmandu, where 160 babies have been born since the earthquake. If you want to help us reach more pregnant women, and help make sure their babies are delivered safely, please donate now.Baby Prajwal survived the Nepal quake, but thousands more are in dangerSun 3 May 14.04: Watch this video diary from our reporter Natalie in Nepal. She met people in the remote commuity of Khokhana, who are too terrified to go back to their partially destroyed homes because of the risk of aftershocks.  Natalie talked to two new mothers who are worried about their babies, because they don't have enough water to mix for formula, or enough food to stay strong enough to breastfeed.Thanks to the incredible generosity of our supporters, aid is getting through and we've reached thousands of people in Nepal already. But we need to do more. If you haven't had the chance to donate yet, please give to our appeal here.Sun 3 May 12.10: A reminder of the destruction we're seeing everywhere we go - this school in Kot Danda is badly damaged and on the verge of collapse.  A sad sight from Kot Danda, the school in their mountain village,#Nepal.

And 21,000 of these new mums will need obstetric care in the coming three months.As Puza told us below, it's a terrifying time for mothers in Nepal to bring a baby into the world when they have lost their homes and scarcely have enough food to eat themselves, let alone to feed their newborn baby. Every donation helps us reach more mothers with the food and vital care they need. Please give what you can now. Sat 2 May 10.31: Getting deliveries out to rural communities is difficult when so many of the roads are blocked. Another road blocked to cars, either debris hasn't been cleared or weakened buildings.

We don't have enough food, and I'm getting weaker. How can I survive if I'm not strong enough to feed my baby?"Right now I'm only eating one meal a day of rice. I have to breastfeed Smirika up to 15 times a day. We are staying in a tent with 30 people.

Of these, 750,000 people live near the epicentre of the quake in unsafe housing.Power throughout Kathmandu is limited, with most households and offices mainly relying on generator power.

Tom reminds everyone to donate to the DEC appeal to help save lives.Tues 28 Apr 11.20: Updates from Tom as he travels through Kathmandu.Many buildings I'm seeing have collapsed internally which is dangerous.

Details to follow.Day 3: Death toll rising and communication is scarceMonday 27 April: The reported death toll has risen to 3,500, with many more injured. Survivors are facing aftershocks and the risk of being trapped and injured by falling rubble.National World Heritage Centre Kastamundup collapsed after the earthquakeWe've been working round the clock since the earthquake struck on Saturday to mobilise our emergency response.That means fundraising here in the UK, sending our expert resilience teams to Nepal and most of all working with our partners on the ground in Kathmandu and the worst-affected areas in Nepal to assess what communities most need from us right now.But communications are extremely limited and we've had only scant contact with our local team. Staff in Nepal have been sleeping and working outside since Saturday, as are most of Kathmandu’s inhabitants. People whose homes haven’t been destroyed are too scared of aftershocks to go back inside.For our live reports on Days 1 and 2 in Nepal, go here.Donate now to help us reach survivors
