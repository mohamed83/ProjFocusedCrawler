(Niranjan Shrestha/AP)  The devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake that violently shook Nepal on Saturday left more than human casualties in its wake. The country also saw a number of its iconic UNESCO World Heritage sites and most popular tourist attractions -- some dating more than 1,700 years -- reduced to piles of rubble. Among the well-known Kathmandu landmarks destroyed by the quake was the 100-foot Dharahara Tower, which was cut down to a 30-foot pile of jagged brick, according to Reuters. Originally built for the queen of Nepal in 1832, the lighthouse lookalike was rebuilt following a powerful 1934 earthquake that claimed more than 16,000 lives, according to the Wall Street Journal. Open to visitors for the past decade, as many as 200 people were inside the nine-story tower when it toppled, a police officer told Reuters.

Among the most well-known are tiered temples made of fired brick and timber. "The roofs are covered with small overlapping terracotta tiles, with gilded brass ornamentation," according to a UNESCO description. "The windows, doorways and roof struts have rich decorative carvings. The stupas have simple but powerful forms with massive, whitewashed hemispheres supporting gilded cubes with the all-seeing eternal Buddha eyes."

Posted by UNESCO on Saturday, April 25, 2015   In the hours after the quake, rescuers picked through the rubble of historic structures around the region, including ancient wooden Hindu temples, according to Reuters. "I can see three bodies of monks trapped in the debris of a collapsed building near a monastery," said Devyani Pant, an Indian tourist. "We are trying to pull the bodies out and look for anyone who is trapped."   People aghast at the sight of their historic temples destroyed.
