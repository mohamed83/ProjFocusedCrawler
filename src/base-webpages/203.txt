Prashanth Vishwanathan ActionAid photographer




Our photographer Prashanth Vishwanathan was one of the first to arrive in Kathmandu after Nepal's worst earthquake for 80 years. He's part of our emergency response team, delivering aid on the ground to survivors. Here he tells the stories behind his photos.

The photo above is of 40-year-old Adimaya. She'd just made it back to her home in Phalame village in the Khatmandu valley to find it completely destroyed by the earthquake and all her livestock dead. A single mother with two children, the house and her livestock were her only support system. She told me, "The only thing left in this world for me is this piece of cloth I am wearing."Searching for survivors after the quakeHere in the city of Buaktapur, 8km from Kathmandu, the army are searching for survivors, Two days after the quake, the chance of finding any is slim.Nepalese army members search for survivors in the city of Buaktapur, 8km from KathmanduIn Kathmandu, almost every street is filled with rubble and bricks. Around every corner, historical temples have been destroyed, or stand amidst the ruins of other buildings.I have covered the Bihar floods and Cyclone Phailin, both massive disasters. The basic difference here is the scale of destruction. Historical monuments at Darbar square at Bhaktapur stand in ruinsChildren are playing in the rubbleSince the earthquake struck, 1.3 million children need humanitarian assistance.A young Nepali girl stands amidst the ruins caused by the earthquake in KathmanduSix-year-old Gungun (top left in this photo), has been living in a van with her family since Saturday's earthquake. She told me she managed to run down six flights of stairs before her house collapsed.6-year old Gungun has been living in a van with her family, since the earthquakeAid is arriving but water is scarce in KathmanduAid deliveries are getting through to Kathmandu, bringing much-needed clean water to the families who lost their homes in the capital. Now people are queuing for hours to fill water containers.People are queuing for hours to fill water containers in KathmanduActionAid's ground work in the past has led them to be more trusted by the local community. A local committee is formed in the community and they distribute the relief as and when required. A list of all the relief material provided is prepared and put up in the camps for maximum transparency. Thousands of people are living out in the openSince the earthquake struck, about 56,000 people have been living outside in the grounds of the Tudikhel near Darbar Square in Kathmandu.

Sundaya and her family have lost three houses to this earthquake. ActionAid was the only agency to reach with aid to the remote village of Phalame in the district of Khabre in Nepal. All 150 houses have been levelled in this quake. A local told me "no one has come here, no news channel, no government and no NGO - you are the only one."72 year old Sundaya Tamang whispers to her cow Lakshmi as she lies buried in her cowshed unable to be rescued.See more photos and updates from our emergency response as they happen on our live blog.How you can helpActionAid is Nepal right now delivering emergency aid to earthquake survivors.
