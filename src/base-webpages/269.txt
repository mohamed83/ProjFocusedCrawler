Things to Know About the Nepal Earthquake

1
Earthquake Was Powerful and Deadly

Share on Twitter



Nepal’s Home Ministry put the death toll at more than 1,800. The earthquake caused widespread damage around Katmandu. The quake, which also triggered an avalanche at Mount Everest, could be felt in the Indian capital, New Delhi, as well as in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Nepal is Prone to Earthquakes 

Share on Twitter



The quake struck in what is known as the Indus-Yarlung suture zone, where the Indian subcontinent meets the Eurasian tectonic plate. The collision of the two, 40 million to 50 million years ago, gave rise to the Himalayas. It is an area that has been the site of some of the region’s deadliest earthquakes, including one in Kashmir in 2005 that killed more than 80,000 people. A powerful earthquake also struck Nepal in 1934, causing mass casualties.

Historic Sites Were Damaged in Quake

Share on Twitter



Katmandu and its suburbs are full of centuries-old historical sites. The area has so many important temples, palaces and courtyards—many of them more than 300 years old—that seven areas of the Katmandu Valley are protected as a Unesco World Heritage site. Parts of Katmandu’s Durbar Square were reduced to rubble in the quake. Unesco’s website says Durbar Square is “the social, religious and urban focal point of the city, built between the 12th and the 18th centuries by the ancient Malla kings of Nepal.”

Nepal Has Faced Political Turmoil

Share on Twitter



A landlocked country of around 30 million, Nepal is one of the world’s poorest and least-developed nations. It has faced a recent wave of political turmoil amid debate over a new constitution. Politicians in Nepal, which was a monarchy until 2008, have struggled for years to write a new national constitution. One of the central disputes is whether the country should be divided into states along ethnic lines. Nepal’s government fought for a decadelong civil war with Maoist rebels that ended in 2006 when the Maoists agreed to lay down their arms and join a political-reconciliation process.








5
U.S., Others Offer Assistance

Share on Twitter



Indian air-force planes began flying in rescue teams and supplies. The European Commission and the U.S. Embassy in Nepal each said experts were on their way to the quake-stricken areas, while the German government said it would help as well. The commission said it is considering offering financial help, while the U.S. is providing immediate aid of $1 million.
