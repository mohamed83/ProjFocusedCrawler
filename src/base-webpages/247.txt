"When I went out in the evening, I saw many people preparing to camp out in the main open parade ground in the middle of the street. Relatives were crying in the main government hospital where the dead were being lined up in front of the hospital building."My family is traumatized. We are 5 generations living under one roof -- from a 100 year old grandmother to my 16 month old granddaughter.
