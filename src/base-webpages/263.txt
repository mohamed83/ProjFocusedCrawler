Thousands of people have died after Nepal was hit by its worst earthquake in 80 years.
The earthquake caused devastation in the capital city of Kathmandu and triggered an avalanche at Everest, injuring and wounding many people. 
By Monday, rescuers were attempting to make their way to Nepal’s more remote villages, with fears the death toll may rise even higher. Reports received so far by the government and aid groups suggest that many communities perched on mountainsides are ruined or struggling to cope. 
As the government and aid groups continue their efforts, we’d like to hear from those who have been affected by the earthquake. Perhaps you live in Nepal, have family members who have been affected or are part of the rescue mission. Are you involved in organising part of the relief effort in the country or from home? Share your photos, videos and stories and we’ll use your submissions as part of our coverage on the Guardian. 
You can share your photos and stories by clicking on the blue ‘Contribute’ button on this article. You can also use the GuardianWitness smartphone app or the Guardian app and search for ‘GuardianWitness assignments’. You can also email us at guardian.witness@theguardian.com.
