A second earthquake has hit Nepal, of 7.3 magnitude, as the country attempts to recover from the 7.8 magnitude quake that hit just weeks ago. Aid agencies have been in the country delivering vital supplies and planning the rebuilding process, and are now on-hand to assist after the latest quake. The UK’s Disasters Emergency Committee launched an appeal to support survivors two weeks ago which has raised more than £50m. Here is a roundup of some of the agencies that have opened appeals for earthquake survivors. This list is not comprehensive, so feel free to highlight others in the comments section below.
ActionAid
The agency has reached more than 48,500 people so far with emergency aid including food, medicine, tarpaulins and hygiene kits. ActionAid aims to scale up its outreach over the coming months, including plans to build “safe spaces” for women and children who can be particularly vulnerable after natural disasters.
How to donate
British Red Cross
As well as providing much-needed supplies including food and emergency shelter, Red Cross volunteers are searching for survivors through the rubble of collapsed buildings. The organisation also has a recently built blood bank in Kathmandu, providing blood to help injured survivors.

Cafod
Catholic aid agency Cafod has committed £50,000 to respond to the emergency and has launched a £3m appeal. Cafod’s local partners are providing food, shelter kits and emergency supplies to people in need, including many who are taking shelter in churches.
How to donate
Care
Care aims to assist 100,000 people with temporary shelter, ready-to-eat meals, water purification and toilet construction. “All of the particularly vulnerable – children, breastfeeding mothers, people with chronic diseases – they have been suffering a lot. It’s essential to get help to these people as quickly as we can,” says Santosh Sharma, Care’s emergency response coordinator in Kathmandu.

Catholic Relief Services
Working with Caritas Nepal, CRS plans to assist 10,000 families with emergency shelter, blankets, water treatment kits, and hygiene kits. The agency has stocks of emergency aid in nearby Bihar, India, which is now on its way to Nepal for distribution. CRS has made an initial commitment of $825,000 to relief efforts.
How to donate
Christian Aid
Christian Aid is working with its partners based in Nepal to reach survivors. Its sister agency Lutheran World Foundation Nepal is helping to coordinate emergency supplies for the government-run camp, while local organisation PGVS is distributing 100,000 water purification kits that Christian Aid has provided.

How to donate
Handicap International
Handicap International has supplied equipment to hospitals in Kathmandu and sent support teams to care for the injured. The agency is working to reduce the risk of permanent disabilities among survivors, while supporting the most vulnerable people caught up in the disaster.
How to donate 
International Medical Corps
International Medical Corps workers are providing emergency care to survivors, as well as delivering much-needed medical supplies. The organisation has opened a mobile medical unit in Ghorka, near the earthquake epicentre, with plans to expand to other affected areas.
How to donate
Islamic Relief
The organisation has disaster response workers assessing the needs of survivors and will be providing food, shelter, water and other items such as hygiene kits and kitchen sets.
How to donate
Oxfam
Oxfam is providing basic essentials to survivors and will build sanitation facilities in temporary camps in partnership with Unicef. “Our priority is to ensure that people affected have adequate humanitarian assistance and we are able to prevent secondary disasters, including outbreak of disease, by providing safe water and critical sanitation support,” says Zubin Zaman, deputy director of Oxfam India.

Plan
The charity says it is stepping up efforts to support 7,000 families with shelter kits including tarpaulins, mattresses, mosquito nets and blankets. Plan’s UK chief executive, Tanya Barron, says some rural communities outside the epicentre have had consecutive nights without shelter. “These remote communities are what are causing us most concern,” she says. “It’s clear when you move around that people are struggling to improvise shelters, and with more rain expected this is something we need to urgently address.”
How to donate: UK, International
Save the Children
The charity aims to raise $50m to assist with aid efforts in Nepal. Workers have begun delivering tarpaulins to survivors in Kathmandu and baby packs in the Bhaktapur district, which include children’s clothes, blankets and soap. More assistance is on its way to the hardest-hit regions outside Kathmandu Valley, including Gorkha and Sindhupalchowk.
How to donate: UK, International
Tearfund
Tearfund staff and partners remain in Nepal with a focus on shelter, food and sanitation. Teams have been trekking over landslides and mountains to reach remote communities impacted by the quake. 
How to donate
Unicef
The agency says it is focusing on water and sanitation, nutrition, education and child protection. Unicef has already delivered oral rehydration salts and zinc supplements to people gathered in informal settlements, and is providing tents for field medical facilities. Two cargo flights with a combined 120 tonnes of humanitarian supplies are also on their way.
 How to donate: UK, International 
Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO)
VSO is raising funds to support its existing programmes and to recruit skilled volunteers to help communities recover. This includes emergency education spaces for children, sending highly skilled healthcare professionals to hospitals and for trauma counselling, and damage assessment in remote areas. 
 How to donate
WaterAid
WaterAid is working with its local partners to provide emergency water supplies, hygiene kits, water purification tablets and emergency trenches for sanitation. “Our immediate priority is to work with our partners to assess what is most needed in the communities where we work, and how we can help prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases including typhoid and cholera,” said Girish Menon, WaterAid’s deputy chief executive.
How to donate: UK, International 
We Help Nepal 
This is a network of international and Nepali development workers and activists with over a decade of direct disaster relief experience. Through connections with local organisations in Kathmandu and surrounding areas, these people know where support is most needed in the region – and how to get it there. The group is focused on supporting small- to mid-level grassroots organisations that have the capacity to support locally led disaster relief and recovery. Immediate funding will go towards emergency supplies (food, tents, water purification, assisting camps in Kathmandu neighbourhoods). In the longer term, they will turn to promoting self-reliance, supporting projects that are sustainable and will bring hope in the years to come. 
How to donate
World Food Programme
WFP is delivering food and emergency supplies to affected areas. It is also providing logistical support for other aid agencies via a relief hub at Kathmandu’s international airport, including electricity communications facilities, storage space and office buildings.
How to donate
World Vision
World Vision is planning to respond in its initial phase to 50,000 people, meeting basic needs by providing first aid kits, sleeping mats, blankets and jerry cans, and temporary shelter. The agency will also set up three child-friendly spaces so children have a safe place to play and recover from trauma.
How to donate: UK, International
American Jewish World Service
The agency is funding its Nepalese partners to provide medical assistance and emergency food and supplies to affected communities. AJWS says it is supporting vulnerable groups who could be disproportionately affected, including Tibetan refugees, the Dalit community, people in remote regions, people with disabilities and LGBT people.
