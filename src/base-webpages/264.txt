A man pulled from the rubble of a collapsed hotel by a French rescue team more than three days after the Nepal earthquake says he drunk his own urine to survive.
Rishi Khanal, 27, had just finished lunch at a hotel in Kathmandu and had gone up to the second floor when the building suddenly started to move and fall apart. He was struck by falling masonry and his foot became trapped under rubble.

“I had some hope but by yesterday I’d given up. My nails went all white and my lips cracked … I was sure no one was coming for me. I was certain I was going to die,” he said from his hospital bed on Wednesday.
Khanal was surrounded by dead bodies and a terrible smell. But he kept banging on the rubble all around him and eventually this attracted the attention of a French rescue team, which extracted him after an operation lasting several hours. By the time he was pulled out, Khanal had been trapped – in what could have become his tomb – for 82 hours.
“There was no sound going out, or coming in. I kept banging against the rubble and finally someone responded and came to help. I hadn’t eaten or had anything to drink so I drank my own urine.”

It was not clear if he was a hotel employee or a guest. “It feels good. I am thankful,” Khanal said, before being taken away for surgery.
More than 5,000 people are known to have died and over 10,000 injured in Nepal in the magnitude 7.8 earthquake. There were also deaths in India, Tibet and Bangladesh.
