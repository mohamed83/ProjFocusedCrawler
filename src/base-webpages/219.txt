Small charities are key to Nepal's recovery









Grassroots organisations are able to access remote areas and communities that bigger aid agencies cannot

















Large aid agencies are too far removed from the reality of every day life in Nepal, says Casagrande.

When the first earthquake struck, my Nepali co-worker and I were on our way back from a routine visit to the schools my charity sponsors. We heard an enormous bang, the buildings were swaying and people were screaming as they struggled down steps and clung to walls. It was the most terrifying experience I have ever had, but as a small charity leader there was the added sense of responsibility.
HiCap UK has been supporting schoolchildren and schools in the Lamjung district of Nepal for the past 10 years. Lamjung was close to the epicentre of the first earthquake and the villages we work with were severely damaged but, miraculously, no one was killed. In the largest village in the area, Bahundana, 135 of the 450 houses are in need of repair and at least a dozen need to be rebuilt.

It has never been easy to work in this area of Nepal – it is remote and mountainous and there is so much need for our support. We are a small charity, but we are doing our best and have a deep connection with the communities there. This is why I believe its is grassroots organisations, like mine, that are key to the recovery of Nepal.
The Red Cross has delivered tents, food and medical supplies to the area. But the monsoon season is imminent and the communities that have been made homeless need proper shelter, which is where we step in. We work directly with the Nepalese people and this way of working means we can get things done – no red tape and no bureaucracy.
We have a very small team: one person living in the mountain region who works daily with the local people, two based in Kathmandu, me in the UK and a handful of volunteers. If something needs doing and we have the funds, it gets done. 
We may not have helicopters to deliver aid but we do have common sense and we know the people, the country and the costs. We’ve got a lot of experience that, for the most part, the larger aid agencies do not have.

The problem is that people who work for large aid agencies are often removed from the everyday life and real living standards that the Nepali people experience. For me the aims of aid agencies would be better served if the funding went to smaller charities that know the area and people well. We have much lower administrative costs, can act immediately and know how to spend money in ways that are best for remote communities. 
The DEC has raised £50m so far in its Nepal earthquake appeal, and while the mountain of publicity has raised awareness, it has increased competition among charities for funding. It is tough for smaller, grassroots organisations like us. The big agencies advertise on television and have prominence wherever people donate. It’s a pity that we cannot compete, when we are an organisation with deep, local roots who know and understand where the funding is needed.

However, we are and will continue to be out there, doing what we can to meet the Nepali people’s needs. We are using our first lot of funding to supply temporary but secure housing before the monsoon hits. We can build weather-proof accommodation working with local people and volunteers for just over a £100 per shelter. This is just the beginning. We may only be a pebble in the pond but we hope to send out more and more ripples, get the work done and bring our villages back to where they ought to be, with or without the help of the big aid agencies.
