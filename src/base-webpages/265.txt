A British backpacker missing in Nepal following last month’s earthquake has been confirmed as being among the dead, the Foreign Office has said. 
The family of Matthew Carapiet paid tribute on Saturday to the 23-year-old gap-year student who “made a huge impression on the lives of everyone he met”. 
The 7.8-magnitude earthquake rocked Nepal, triggering avalanches and mudslides and reducing whole villages to rubble when it struck on 25 April. The death toll has passed 8,000.
Carapiet, an architecture student from Bearsted in Kent, was trekking through the Langtang valley when the earthquake struck. He was last known to be near Langtang village, a popular trekking destination which was totally engulfed by an avalanche and landslide.
According to reports, the village was home to 435 people and it had 55 hotels and guest houses. Just one house remained following the earthquake. 
In a statement released through the Foreign Office, Carapiet’s family said: “It is with great sadness that we can confirm the death of our son Matthew following the earthquake in Nepal on 25 April. Matt was touring Asia in a gap year before planning to continue his architecture studies in the autumn.
“He spoke to us regularly about how much he was enjoying his travels and we know he was doing something that he loved. He had been trekking in Nepal for two weeks before the earthquake. 
“Matt is loved by his family and friends who all have countless memories of how kind, happy and caring he was. He made a huge impression on the lives of everyone he met. This has been a very difficult time for the whole family, and we now need time to grieve. We would ask for privacy as we come to terms with our loss.”
The confirmation of Carapiet’s death came as the British government announced that nearly 100 more British army Gurkhas had arrived in Nepal to help with the relief effort. It brings the total number of British military personnel sent to the region in the two weeks since the devastating earthquake to around 300.
The 92 Gurkhas from 36 Engineer Regiment, based in Maidstone in Kent, arrived in two groups on Friday and Saturday. They will focus on providing support to the villages of serving and veteran Gurkhas and their families, the Ministry of Defence said.
