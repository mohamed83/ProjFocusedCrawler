The desperate search for survivors from the country's worst natural disaster in more than 80 years continued.      The number of people confirmed dead in Nepal stands at 3,218, said Nepalese Ministry of Home Affairs spokesman Laxmi Dhakal. India has reported 56 deaths, and China another 20.       The death toll is expected to climb further as officials get information from the rugged countryside that makes up most of Nepal.      As day broke Monday, Nepal was still in survival mode after suffering a series of aftershocks following the huge initial quake on Saturday.      The damage was everywhere. Stunned residents wandered the streets of Kathmandu, the capital city of roughly 3 million people that's now the focus of international disaster relief efforts. Video shows survivor pulled from rubblePeople dug through piles of debris where their homes once stood, seeking pieces of their former lives and, possibly, family members.

Rescuers lift him up, and cheers of joy erupt from the crowd. The clip shows him being put on a stretcher and carried to safety.But often, searchers have found bodies rather than survivors. And the odds of saving the living decrease as the crucial first 72 hours tick by. Panorama of devastationThe earthquake and its aftershocks have turned one of the world's most scenic regions into a panorama of devastation."The journey towards my family home in Sitapaila was a map of quake destruction, with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart," wrote freelance journalist Sunir Pandey. "A high wall surrounding a monastery had collapsed and the nuns had run to a nearby field," he wrote. "A mud-and-brick cottage had fallen on a blue motorbike but no trace could be found of its rider. Everywhere, survivors gathered wherever they could find open space -- fields, private compounds, empty roadside lots."At night, many Nepalis slept in the open, shivering in the frigid air of the Himalayan Mountains but at least safe from falling debris."The entire city was under darkness," Christina Berry of England wrote for CNN affiliate IBN from Kathmandu. "There was not a single light anywhere. The power supply had been cut off. Our caring hotel manager gave us some food and some candles, too. Me and Alexandra were so scared. We slept in the open verandah of the hotel fearing more quakes in the night."Read earthquake stories from social mediaPeople banding together to surviveCNN producer Ingrid Formanek, who arrived Sunday night, said Kathmandu "looks like a city where buildings have been abandoned. People are hanging out in public squares and at intersections to avoid rubble from buildings."JUST WATCHEDNepal: A nation in ruinsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNepal: A nation in ruins 01:41PLAY VIDEO"We were able to drive the main road to the hotel we're staying at, but they're not allowing anyone inside because of the aftershocks. The guests are in a big tent used for functions on the lawn. People are squeezed in. There are probably about 100 people in there," Formanek said. "The tents are covered, but water is seeping in from streets puddled with water, especially around the edges of the tent."Residents of Kathmandu are banding together to get by, with stores shuttered and very few sources of food and drinkable water."Communal kitchens have been set up for cooking," Formanek said. "Not by the government -- people set them up on their own." Aftershocks add to fearsMany of the city's centuries-old buildings, which had stood stalwart for generations and provided a sense of national pride, have been toppled.

Climbers said it set off fresh avalanches on Mount Everest, where at least 17 people were reported to have been killed on Saturday.The magnitude of the new quake Sunday was initially estimated at 6.7 by the U.S. Geological Survey, considerably weaker than the magnitude-7.8 of the devastating one of a day earlier.Four U.S. citizens among deadFour Americans were confirmed to be among the dead.
