Nepal earthquake: learn lessons or more will die in future disasters, warns expert









Risk-management specialist says Nepal reconstruction effort must incorporate safeguards against future natural disasters rather than being rushed through

Thousands more Nepalese people will die in future earthquakes and the country will slide further back into poverty if the government and the international community do not learn the lessons of Saturday’s disaster, a risk-management expert has warned.
More than 5,000 people are now known to have died in the magnitude 7.8 quake, although the Nepalese government warned on Tuesday that the death toll could reach 10,000. 
Katie Peters, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), said that although significant progress had been made in retrofitting schools and hospitals and training people how to respond to earthquakes, more needs to be done to mitigate the effects of future natural disasters.
Peters, who works with Nepalese government on disaster risk, said that failure to invest in “building back better”, improving infrastructure and making sure everyone was as prepared as possible for quakes would prove costly. “There will continue to be a rise in both loss of life and economic loss from disasters,” she said. “That’s the reality – and it will cost more for the international community.”

While she commended the swift humanitarian response to the crisis, Peters said the rush to rebuild should not come at the expense of proper planning. “There’s always a tension between wanting to rebuild as soon as possible – which is human nature – and taking the time to make sure that there’s consideration of the whole range of disasters that Nepal faces and making sure that we don’t carry risk into our reconstruction efforts,” she said.
“If we’re rebuilding schools and hospitals, we need to make sure it’s done in a way that can withstand an earthquake of the same magnitude again. [A quake] can massively increase the rates of poverty – and Nepal is among the 11 countries globally that are most at risk of disaster-induced poverty.” 
Peters said focusing on risk reduction would be in everyone’s interests: not only would it help safeguard the futures of hundreds of thousands of Nepalese, it would also save the donor community tens of millions of pounds. “The statistics show that five times more funding goes on response than it does on preparing for a disaster and trying to reduce the impact of a disaster, and that’s something that the international community can do,” she said.
“Every dollar spent on preparedness saves eight dollars in response – the evidence is so clear. There’s so much more attention that goes on to responding to a disaster, but at the same time, as donors, we need to make sure that we are continuing to support both communities and governments before the next disaster strikes so there’s not just an influx when there is a disaster; we need to help people beforehand.”

Although the earthquake had long been predicted, Peters said she hoped it would serve as a wake-up call on the importance of investing in preparation. “That’s the lesson that countries learn time and time again: there will often be piecemeal efforts to try to invest in how you manage the effects of a disaster, but it’s not until one happens that people actually start pushing it up the priority list,” she said.
Peters said local communities had to be central to disaster risk management as they were the ones who had found themselves digging people out of the rubble 24 hours before the humanitarian agencies arrived. 
She also said that the international community had learned much from the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti. Following the quake, which killed between 90,000 and 316,000 people and displaced more than 1.5 million, donors were criticised for channelling aid funding through big agencies and NGOs rather than local Haitian organisations.
“The international community has learned from that already, and you can see from the response in Nepal that people are actively trying to make sure that they are working in support of local and national response efforts – and that’s what’s going to make it sustainable,” she said.
“If you help to build local and national capacity to respond, the big dream is that in the long run, there won’t be a need for international support.”
