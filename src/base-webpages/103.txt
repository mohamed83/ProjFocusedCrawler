     Your title here               Nepal is vulnerable to earthquakes because it straddles the boundary between two tectonic plates which collided 50 million years ago forming the Himalayas    The epicentre of the 25 April earthquake was in a remote area of Gorkha district 80 kilometres north-west of Kathmandu. It had a magnitude of 7.8 and a shallow underground focal point of 15km, which increased ground shaking. Several aftershocks occurred in the following days.     3.0-4.0   4.0-5.0   5.0-6.0   6.0-7.0   7.0-8.0   Intensity of earthquake  Moment magnitude     50 miles   China Xizang Tibet   Fault line   Mount Everest – detail below   The worst affected areas – details below   Epicentre   Kathmandu   Total deaths by district    The earthquake took a deadly toll in both the densely populated Kathmandu valley and isolated rural villages     15-200   200-400   400-800   1,300-2,500   800-1,300    Death toll     Epicentre   50 miles   India   China Tibet   Gorkha   Kathmandu   Sindhupalchwok     Sindhupalchowk The death toll in this hilly district is expected to rise further as remote villages await aid.
