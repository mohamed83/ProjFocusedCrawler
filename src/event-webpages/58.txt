The Guardian view on the Mediterranean boat people: Europe cannot evade its humanitarian obligations


Editorial








There is no easy answer but we must find a way of working together to save lives

“The bodies of the drowned are more varied than you’d think,” says the character Stefano in the opening scene of a new play, Lampedusa (in London now, at Aldeburgh and Liverpool later in the year). The work of the young playwright Anders Lustgarten, the title refers to the island where Stefano works rescuing the bodies of those who’d fled from war and disaster in Africa and the Middle East, and found death at sea instead. “They’re overwhelmingly young, the dead,” he observes. “Twenties. Thirty at most. Kids, a lot of them. You have to be to make the journey, I suppose.” The play wants to make its audience ask what kind of society it wants. Within days of its opening last week, 400 people were missing presumed drowned after a wooden fishing boat capsized off the Libyan coast. Its human cargo had all rushed to one side in the hope of rescue. At the start of what is becoming the Mediterranean’s annual drowning season, the question of what sort of society we want to be is a challenge for all Europeans.
This week’s death toll brings the number feared drowned since January to somewhere near a thousand. This time last year, the figure was just 17. Many things are different now: the Italian-funded Mare Nostrum search and rescue operation, which cost around €9m a month to run, has been abandoned. In its place is Triton, a low-budget Europe-funded operation that sticks within 30km of the shoreline. Second is the intensification of both the political persecution and economic failure that drive thousands of people to risk everything trying to reach Europe. There is the complete collapse of Libya, the country that once provided a bulwark between Europe and Africa, and the increasing sophistication of the network of traffickers operating out of Egypt and in particular Libya. Some even have websites that look as if they are part of the official EU. The plight of the Mediterranean boat people confronts Europe with a series of hard questions. The way they are answered will play a big part in the way its members see the EU.

Italy and Greece bear the brunt of the arrival of refugees who come by sea (while Spain has taken thousands of migrants from south-east Europe). The official line is that more must be done to stop them ever leaving Africa or the Middle East in the first place. That could be done by providing more support in the home country or just across the land border. For some, notably Syrians, facilities should be made available locally to apply for a visa. That would make it much easier to arrive safely and legitimately. In theory, the traffickers will be targeted, but their networks have become too sophisticated to make that an easy option. A European commission action plan will be launched next month that is likely to propose boosting the EU’s feeble frontier organisation, Frontex, and introducing a fairer system of distributing refugees around the EU. People who had hoped to join family in, say, Athens or London may end up in Estonia instead.
Organisations such as the European Council on Refugees and Exiles will be arguing hard to restore an adequate search and rescue facility. This is surely the least that can be done by a humane society. They want greater financial solidarity between north and south, and the possibility of giving refugees papers that would allow them to live or work anywhere in Europe. But the EU on this issue often seems just the narrow inward-looking group of nation states that its early critics warned about. For most members, immigration is the single most contentious issue. Apart from Germany and Sweden, most countries have taken few refugees. Nationalist parties of the right are on the rise everywhere. There is little appetite among politicians for a generous gesture. Nor of course is there a collective EU immigration policy, only a small border agency and the principle of the free movement of workers.
No treaties govern burden-sharing or set standards for the treatment offered to third-country migrants. Those remain a matter for individual states, and no EU member would surrender control over non-EU immigration to a new European commission body today. But this is a crisis where the bureaucratic pragmatism of Brussels demands that Europe’s politicians find a common approach motivated not only by pragmatism but by humanity and compassion too.
