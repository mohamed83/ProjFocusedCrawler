31Mar2015 			Checks, Balances, and the Draft Agreement on the Political Transition in Libya		
Has a breakthrough happened in Morocco with the UN negotiations?  Read Azza Maghur of the Atlantic Council to find out.
The United Nations Support Mission to Libya (UNSMIL) issued its first draft agreement on the political transition in Libya that was given to the parties to the political dialogue, taking place in different cities inside and outside of Libya since September 2014. The last round of political talks took place in the Moroccan city of Skhirat last week, where the rival political forces discussed, among other ideas, the formation of a National Unity Government—a cornerstone of the draft agreement.
Libya’s draft agreement does not include a deadline for the Prime Minister to issue laws drafted and approved by the House of Representatives, nor does it implement a mechanism to guarantee their issuance. To achieve the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of the government and to prevent one branch from usurping the authority of the other, the issuance of laws should not depend on the will and whims of a single entity—in this case the Prime Minister. The danger of this clause is that it gives veto power to the Prime Minister over the House of Representatives to the extent that he can block its work and render it obsolete.
In its current form, this clause (Article 7, Point 3 of the proposed draft) can effectively strip the House of Representatives of its primary authority and power. To correct this flaw and prevent this outcome, Article 34 Section 8 andArticle 19 from the proposals of the February 17 Commission together as previously intended. While acknowledging the importance of this draft accord and the excellent effort put into it by all the parties involved, Libya and its partners must remain cautious against any potential obstacles to its future implementation.

26Mar2015 			Haftar Holds the Key to Peace in Libya		
The last days have seen two key interventions by Mattia Toaldo in the debate on Libya.  He crucially points out in a Middle East Eye piece, how Haftar’s recent airstrikes were deliberately scheduled to derail the talks. This is a crucial argument as it shows that supporting Haftar on behalf of Egypt or France is guaranteed to prolong the civil war and impede negotiations.  Mattia spells out the key hurdles which are holding back the making of a deal in Morocco.
Ultimately, the “consensus government” may not be a solution to the collapse of the country’s government structure. Thinking that the new executive branch will connect with ministries and government agencies in Tripoli is delusional as long as its decision-making remains in Tobruk, hundreds of miles from the capital.
The transfer of both government and parliament to the capital or to Benghazi will be impossible while the fighting goes on. This is unlikely to stop until the parties agree on a less public item which is under discussion in the talks: a “consensus” head of the armed forces to replace Haftar, or at least a consensual civilian commander-in-chief. This is why for as long as Haftar is in charge, he will do everything he can to sabotage a national unity deal that would ultimately unseat him – and strikes on airports like Maitiga are just the starter.
If talks are going to be successful and if the consensus government is to be effectively operating from Tripoli, it is up to Haftar to call off the offensive against Tripoli. But this is unlikely to happen while he has such powerful friends in the region – and powerful friends of those friends in Europe, particularly in the Italian and French governments.

Separately, Dr Toaldo has helped Reuters unpack why Tubroq’s plans to set up an Eastern NOC are likely to fail. It is all about the contracts and their sanctity and how they exert a kind of momentum that can’t be stopped. To read that click here and below are key excerpts.
But analysts, oil insiders and Libyan businessmen said the eastern firm – also called NOC – is unlikely to persuade buyers that it is the legitimate owner of Africa’s largest oil reserves, as long as the original NOC is still operating in the capital.    ”Oil contracts… are signed with the (Tripoli) NOC and paid into central bank accounts,” said Mattia Toaldo, policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.     “I don’t think that materially the …(eastern) government could change that without modifying these contracts,” he said. “It’d have to assure to the companies that it is in fact in control, which is not the case.” Introducing a new payment system would mean breaking up the central bank, which has processed oil exports though accounts used by buyers for decades, and which is the only source of hard currency for the importers who feed Libya’s 6 million people.
 


24Mar2015 			Talks derailed again as Misratan Militias Face Jihadists		
After a period of relative calm, Libya witnessed several significant developments at the political and military levels throughout last week. Unfortunately, the breakthrough that UNSMIL’s Chief Bernardino Leon was hoping to achieve during the weekend did not occur as UN-backed talks registered another stop. In fact, although representatives from the House of Representatives did go to Morocco, they did not receive a green light from the HoR to re-join UN-backed talks. As a result, and despite UNSMIL’s initial statements to the contrary, talks did not resume on time and did not achieve the establishment of a national unity government backed by both national blocs by Sunday 22 March, let alone an agreement for a pull out of all militias from Libyan cities. On the contrary, between Friday 20 and Sunday 22 March a number of airstrikes and attacks were carried out by both the Operation Dignity-affiliated and Libya Dawn-affiliated air forces. These attacks were clearly aimed at derailing the national rapprochement process underpinned by UN-backed negotiations; this was all the more clear when Operation Dignity fighter jets attacked Tripoli’s Mitiga airport just a few hours before the departure of representatives from the General National Congress to talks in Morocco was scheduled to happen. A strong statement condemning escalating violence and attacks was issued by the UNSMIL as well as by the governments of the US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.  This turn of events reveals that hardline OD-aligned commanders likely supported with Haftar and various Zintani forces are deliberately attempting to scupper the talks. As of Monday 23 March, talks in Skhirat were suspended as UNSMIL’s Bernardino Leon headed to Brussels to take part in scheduled meetings with Libya’s municipalities’ representatives.
The setbacks registered at the level of UN negotiations were not the only ones occurred during the past week, unfortunately. As a matter of fact, after having witnessed a duplication of governments, observers of Libyan affairs witnessed during the past week a long-feared development: the duplication of the NOC. In fact, on Tuesday 17 March, the House of Representatives-appointed Chairman of the National Oil Corporation (NOC) al-Mabrook Abu Seif announced from his office in Benghazi that international partners and stakeholders should not deal anymore with the NOC offices based in Tripoli, but only with the legitimate, Tubruq-based Libyan government. In this statement, Abu Seif claimed that only the Tubruq-based government had the necessary legitimacy to continue looking after Libya’s oil interests and that, therefore, new payments methods would be set up and any new contract would need to be approved by his office, rather than by the Tripoli-based NOC. In response to this, on Thursday 19 March, the Tripoli-based NOC issued a statement reaffirming its independence and neutrality vis á vis ongoing political disputes. In its statement, the Tripoli-based NOC reaffirmed also the importance that the NOC remains an independent institution so as to maximise the service granted to Libyan people and to avoid any further escalation in the crisis, especially since all payments received by the Tripoli-based NOC have been so far deposited in the accounts of the Central Bank, which is also pursuing a policy of absolute neutrality by providing available funds to both national-level blocs and cabinets. Although it is unclear what consequences the effective duplication of the NOC will have on the current Libyan crisis, it is safe to assume that a recrudescence of fighting might very well ensue, especially in the strategic and oil rich ‘Oil Crescent’ region comprising Sidra and Ras Lanuf’s terminals. It is also possible that in light of these developments, Libya Dawn and Operation Shuruq militias will launch disruptive attacks on the terminals and pipelines of Hariga and Zueitina so as to completely halt the flow of Libya’s oil outside the country.
Militarily speaking, Sirte continues to be under control of militants belonging to Libyan cells of the Islamic State. However, contrary to what happened in previous weeks, fighting between the Misratan-led 166th battalion and radical Jihadists affiliated with the Islamic State has now erupted across the whole of Sirte and surrounding region. Reports indicated that Misratan militias were gearing up to launch an all-out assault over the city after having successfully taken control of a large section of the coastal road (starting from Sirte and for 75km to the west of it), and having dislodged Islamic State’s militants from one of their strongholds in the village of al-Nawfaliyyah, pushing them towards the southern part of the country. Fighting registered a spike in violence when 10 members manning a Libya Dawn checkpoint on the outskirts of al-Nawfaliyyah were killed by IS fighters at the start of last week. This led Misratan militias to abandon then-ongoing tribal negotiations with tribes and notables in Sirte and to try and dislodge militarily IS cells holed up in Sirte and headquartered in the town’s Qadhafi-era Ougadougou conference complex. Overall, however, even though Misratan-led militias might be successful in eradicating Jihadists’ groups from within Sirte and surrounding cities and villages, an unstable security situation will keep marring this region as IS members will likely resort to terrorist and other asymmetric tactics to propagate and perpetuate instability in the region and, more broadly, in the country.


23Mar2015 			Smuggled Libya Gas Fuels Conflict		
A crack investigative journalistic report by Benoit Faucon of the WSJ shows the way in which Libya’s subsidies on petroleum are manipulated by the militias to fund the war between Dawn and Dignity.  I am quoted in it as below:
Smugglers selling Libya’s heavily subsidized gasoline and diesel abroad at jacked-up prices are likely using at least some of the profit to finance fighting between the country’s rival governments, according to a U.N. report.
The U.N. has called for an end to smuggling as it tries to broker a peace deal between Libya Dawn, a group of Islamist militias that holds power in the capital of Tripoli, and a government with Western support that rules the east from the city of Baida, and is supported by militias there.
“Oil subsidies are driving the conflict to the benefit of the militias,” said Jason Pack, head of U.K.-based consultancy Libya Analysis.
The government has previously said the subsidies cost about 800 million Libyan dinars ($587 million) a year, covering products refined from some 250,000 barrels of crude a day. Some of it is refined domestically, while some grades that Libya doesn’t have the capacity to refine are imported.

16Mar2015 			A Week of Waiting in Libya		
On Tuesday 10 March, the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR) requested a one-week postponement of UN-backed talks scheduled to resume on Wednesday 11 March in Morocco, precisely in Skhirat, near the country’s capital city Rabat. Rumours indicate that the request came in a bid to help the HoR and other members of the Tobruk-based establishment find an agreement, or at least form a general consensus, around a set of names to put forward for the formation of a national unity government. Whilst UN-backed negotiations have now been ongoing for a number of weeks, concrete discussions around who could be part of a national unity government had not really been tackled until two weeks ago, when representatives from both Libyan establishments laid out a set of criteria to identify possible candidates. In this sense,  even the return of eight boycotting members to the HoR and the reinstatement of Omar al-Sinki in the post of Minister of Interior can be seen as an attempt to (re-)build a large forum for creating consensus around names to be then presented at the negotiations sessions.
Overall, tepid optimism seems to prevail among international and national stakeholders working for the achievement of a political deal to use as basis for starting the re-construction of Libyan institutions as well as that of a country whose infrastructure has been heavily damaged by months of senseless armed confrontations. In this context, Federica Mogherini, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, asked EU member states to consider the possibility of sending both military and civilian teams to Libya, should an agreement for the establishment of a national unity government be reached at UN-backed negotiations. The teams would be tasked with overseeing the implementation of a countrywide ceasefire, protecting key infrastructure and run capacity-building programmes. Whilst reports indicate that the plan has so far been met with scepticism, it should not be ruled out that EU members could reconsider it when and if negotiations produce concrete results at the political level, or when and if cells of the Islamic State will step up their activities in Libya.
The presence of various active battlefields throughout the country, however, continue to represent a sword of Damocles, hanging over mediation efforts by a thin thread, From a military point of view, Sirte continues to be under control of militants belonging to Libyan cells of the Islamic State, whilst tribal-led negotiations continue to be held, in a bid to resolve peacefully the stalemate paralysing the town. However, even though troops belonging to the Tripoli-affiliated 166th battalion have not engaged into battle with radical Jihadists in Sirte, heavy fighting between Operation Shuruq forces and members of radical Jihadist groups were registered between Saturday 14 and Sunday 15 March in Sirte’s countryside, near the town of al-Nawfaliyyah, one of the first to fall under IS control during the past month. The eruption of fighting came nonetheless as a surprise given widespread rumours indicating that Misratan commanders wanted to avoid opening a new front at a time where the outcome of UN-backed negotiations is far from certain. Even more importantly, the fighting around al-Nawfaliyyah could represent the opening salvo of broader all-out hostilities between Misrata and radical Jihadist groups, leading Jihadists to adopt a much more assertive and aggressive stance towards the commercial port city than they have done so far. The bombing attack occurred this morning around Aburoya area west of Misrata might then just be the first episode in a broader pattern of attacks. Even more importantly, it is worth underlying that whilst all other fronts in Libya seem to follow well-established patterns of fighting, the situation in Sirte remains very fluid and retains the potential of sparking significant developments at the national level once the stance of Misratan militias vis a vis Jihadist groups is clarified.
Lastly, although no major fighting erupted during the past days in the ‘Oil Crescent’ region, it is worth focusing on this region in light of a potentially explosive development occurred in the last week. At the political level, this week witnessed in fact significant turmoil when news broke that a Panama-flagged vessel, called Vito, tried to approach the port of Sidra to lift some oil. The attempt to sell oil through Sidra by federalist-aligned forces controlling it mirrors a similar incident occurred last year during the tenure of Ali Zeidan as Prime Minister. Should the Panama-flagged tanker succeed in its attempt to load crude from Sidra’s oil terminal or should other tankers approach any of the main ports put under force majeure by the NOC, it is reasonable to expect that forces belonging to Operation Shuruq would mount a new offensive against oil terminals in a bid to prevent federalists’ attempts to benefit fro the sale of Libyan oil outside of official channels and mechanisms.


08Mar2015 			Dialogue Resumes in Morocco as IS Militants Sweep Oil Fields		
During the second half of last week, UN-backed negotiations between Libya’s two main national blocs resumed in Morocco, precisely in Skhirat near the country’s capital city Rabat. For the second time in a row, negotiations’ meetings saw the participation of representatives from both the House of Representatives (HoR) and the General National Congress (GNC). According to reports and sources, participants discussed criteria for identifying potential candidates to be appointed in a new national unity government, but no names or rumours have surfaced for the post of Prime Minister. Both sides agreed that the cabinet should prioritise issues of security and internal stability in cooperation with the country’s outside partners. As of Sunday 8 March, representatives form both the GNC and HoR agreed to return to their constituencies to report on discussions made in Morocco before talks resume next week, either in Skhirat or in an undisclosed location in Algeria.
In the midst of this round of negotiations, UNSMIL Chief Bernardino Leon publicly encouraged the imposition of an EU-led naval blockade of Libya in order to stop weapons smuggling as well as to prevent the illegal sale of Libya’s oil. When asked about it, Federica Mogherini, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, welcomed the idea. However, Mogherini also confirmed that the formation of an inclusive national unity government is a pre-requisite for any concrete discussion around the idea of sending an EU monitoring mission to protect Libya’s key infrastructure and internal stability. The provision of any other non-humanitarian help, as well as a discussion around the lifting of the weapons embargo, would be subjected to the same conditions.
Furthermore, referring to last week’s meetings, Bernardino Leon stressed that both the Tobruk-based and Tripoli-based blocs appear imbued by a renewed sense of urgency. It is reasonable to expect that a good part of this is due to the sweeping rise of Islamic State-linked groups inside Libya and particularly in Sirte’s area. As a matter of fact, Sirte and its surrounding region continue to be marred by increasing levels of lawlessness and to represent one of the hotbeds for radical Islamist groups in the country, alongside Benghazi, Derna and Tripoli. Troops belonging to Libya’s Army 166th Brigade, affiliated with the Tripoli-based government, are currently stationed on the outskirts of Sirte, but no military assault on the city appears to be imminent. On the contrary, and in an explicit attempt to avoid the ‘mistakes made by Haftar in Benghazi’, tribal negotiations continued throughout the past weeks, bringing together representatives from Sirte and Misrata in a bid to resolve the stalemate in Sirte without shedding blood and transforming the city into a battlefield.
A recent article by Nancy Porsia on Deutsche Welle  makes for an extremely interesting read, documenting Ansar al-Shari’a’s rise in Sirte and the new approached taken by IS members in town:

“Everyone loves Ansar al-Sharia in Sirte, because it was the only force since the end of the former regime to ensure security in the city,” a resident told DW. The Islamists replaced the local administrative system about three years ago, attracting hundreds of men of different tribes to Sirte. The members of minor tribes joined Ansar seeking protection from of the more powerful tribes. But the death of the head of Ansar, Ahmed Attir, in early 2014 left a vacuum that opened the door to IS. Since the arrival of IS in the city, police have disappeared from the streets, and all but three Salafist mosques have been giving sermons that perpetuate the rhetoric of religious hatred from Iraq and Syria, inciting jihad.
[…]
But the slaughterers are invisible on the streets. IS foreign fighters stay behind closed doors, whereas IS’s local followers move around in plainclothes, explains a local, who declines to give his identity for security reasons. There is no show of military force here. The pickup truck laden with heavy artillery seen in a video of IS parading though the city, seems to have evaporated.

But the growth of the IS in Libya did not stop to the city of Sirte.  Throughout the whole of last week, in fact, militants based in Sirte’s countryside and presumed to be linked to the IS carried out a number of attacks on oil fields under control of the Petroleum Facilities Guard, killing several guards and deliberately inflicting significant damage to the oil fields infrastructure. On Tuesday 3 March, militants attacked and damaged the oil fields of Mabruk and Bahi, which had already been assaulted in the month of February, as well as that of Dahra. Furthermore, another attack was carried out on Friday 6 March on the oil field in Ghani. During this last operation, militants reportedly kidnapped up to 9 foreign workers, including an Austrian, a Czech and various African, Filipino and Bangladeshi citizens. As a consequence of these attacks, Libya’s NOC declared force majeure over 11 oil fields in the Sirte oil basin.
It is evident by now that Jihadist militants active in Libya have identified oil-related infrastructure as a key target for their destabilising strategy aimed at weakening and delegitimising all other actors on the Libyan stage. If anything, in the coming months, further attacks on oil-related infrastructure and workers should be expected, not only in Sirte and its surrounding region, but also in the ‘Oil Crescent’ region, as well as in areas with a low-density population throughout eastern, western and southern Libya. Hopefully, the fact that members of IS Libyan cells appeared on the Libyan scene by slaughtering 21 Egyptian Copts and by threatening all other parties active in the country will encourage both sides in coming to a compromise soon. Or at least, before prolonged fighting just ends up benefiting radical Jihadists groups currently active and, most worringly, possibly laying low in the country,waiting for the best moment to strike and take control of large swaths of territory.


06Mar2015 			Why Picking Sides in Libya Won’t Work		
Here is my latest in FP with Mattia Toaldo of ECFR on what America needs to do and not do in Libya.
Since the ouster of Muammar al-Qaddafi in 2011, Libya has reverted to a patchwork of city-states loosely governed by warlords, city councils, and tribal networks. The UN-led talks set to resume this week in Morocco will try to reconcile the two loose coalitions that have been facing each other since last summer. One is the internationally recognized government based in the eastern city of Tobruk and its military wing, Operation Dignity, led by General Khalifa Haftar. The other is the Tripoli government installed by the Libya Dawn coalition, which combines Islamist militias with armed groups from the city of Misrata. The Islamic State has recently established itself as a third force that now aims to scupper any chance for reconciliation between the two blocs and thus to profit from the ensuing chaos….
As a result of its international recognition and military support from the Egyptians and the Emiratis, Tobruk has few incentives to negotiate and is willing to take provocative actions to undermine potential progress. It is time for Western leaders to recognize that the Tobruk government is not in a position to address any of the West’s key strategic concerns. Ultimately, the Tobruk parliament is just one actor in Libya’s multipronged civil war. It is not a neutral government that can lead the country out of its present chaos. Moreover, the parliament was deemed unconstitutional in a November 2014 Libyan Supreme Court decision, one to which the major powers have not yet formally reacted. The Europeans and Americans should draw upon the precedent of this decision and take it one step further: they should end their recognition of the Tobruk parliament and state clearly that they will deal only with a national unity government that emerges from the UN-led talks. Until then, the international community will consider ministers from both governments to be representatives of warring factions, thus publicly acknowledging what many have long admitted in private: that all parties in Libya lack the basic attributes of sovereignty….

05Mar2015 			ISIS Fighters Take Over Major Libyan Oilfields		
Here is the latest from Time Magazine about ISIS’s onward march in Libya.
Colonel Ali al-Hassi, a spokesman for Libyan oil industry security told the BBC said the same fighters first took the oilfields at Bahi and Mabruk. “Extremists took control of the Bahi and Mabruk fields and are now heading to seize the Dhahra field following the retreat of the forces guarding these sites,” he said.
“There’s ISIS in Libya because there’s a lack of a state, and there’s the ability of every militia group to control territory because the major factions won’t work together,” says Pack. “The absolutely only way to eliminate territorial pockets in places like Sirte and Derna is if these groups are willing to work together against ISIS.” To read the whole article click here.


04Mar2015 			From the Libyan Press: Explosion at ISIS-Controlled Hisba Building in Derna		
Thanks to Industry Arabic for providing this timely Arabic to English translation from the pan-Arab press:
Explosion at ISIS-Controlled Hisba Building in Derna
Source Al-Arabiya
24 February 2015
An exclusive source of the Afriqiyah news website reports that a facility known as the Hisba Building controlled by the Islamic Police group, which has reportedly pledged loyalty to ISIS, was bombed Sunday night by an unknown entity. There were no casualties.
The source confirmed that the bombing is believed to have been carried out by the “Abu Slim Martyrs Brigade,” an organization considered apostates by ISIS.
In related news, the Libyan Army has confirmed that it has closed all roads leading into the city of Derna.
In recent weeks Libya has seen a string of ISIS terror attacks, including the execution of 21 Egyptian Copts, as well as two suicide bombings in the city of Al-Qubbah.
Faraj Al-Barasi, a leader of Operation Dignity, said that the fighting in the Al-Sabri and Souq al-Hout regions in Benghazi is concluding and will be decisively resolved soon.
In an interview with Libya First TV, Al-Burasi said that the only thing standing between them and a decisive victory is their concern for the lives of their soldiers.
Al-Barasi insisted that the Benghazi Shura Council rebels are beginning to collapse under increasing pressure, exhaustion, their inability to withstand the intensity of the ongoing battle, and the passage of time, stressing that the fighting in Benghazi will be resolved shortly.
Al-Barasi also emphasized the importance of the ongoing battle at the Sidra Oil Terminal, calling it the most significant battle their forces are engaged in, and stressing the need to support the troops with weapons, gear, and ammunition. Barasi denied that there was any dispute between him and General Khalifa Haftar.


02Mar2015 			Is This the Week That Makes or Breaks Libya?		
Before the HoR decision to suspend its participation in UN-backed negotiations on Monday 23 February, various sources indicated last week’s imminent negotiations’ sessions in Morocco as the ‘make or break’ ones, where actors on both sides of the crisis would have been pushed to finally decide whether any positive outcome was to really emerge from the political rapprochement process. However, after the decision by the HoR to retaliate at the political level by recalling its representatives, due to the attack registered in Qubbah, and the rumored promotion of Khalifa Haftar to the rank of Commander in Chief, a post created last week by the HoR, it seems fair to say that Libya has moved back several steps and is now again in the position where every day or week can potentially represent the ‘make or break’ moment for the whole country and its existence.
Besides consolidated patterns of fighting across Benghazi, western Libya and the ‘Oil Crescent’ region, the latest crisis on the national stage continues to be that of Sirte. Contrary to what was stated by several Libya Dawn representatives last week, however, a military assault to retake control of the city and bring it back into the fold of Misratan-led militias has not started. Here, unlike in other parts of the country, tribal negotiations inclusive of all sides involved in the crisis surrounding the city continue unabated, in a bid to reach a political settlement that would avoid transforming Sirte into yet another military battlefield. Paradoxically though, should Misratan tribal leaders agree to a political solution with members of Islamic State cells in Sirte, it is reasonable to expect that this would represent the last nail in the coffin of national-level UN-backed negotiations. Misrata’s ambiguity as to its alliance with radical Jihadist groups and its willingness to conclude political deals with them would ultimately increase resentment in eastern Libya constituencies aligned with the Tobruk-establishment who have been targeted by indiscriminate attacks and targeted killings since the end of the 2011 Revolution.
The possibility of a negotiated settlement between Libya Dawn militias and IS members in Sirte remains nonetheless a long shot, if anything due to the IS unwillingness to settle for negotiations failing to recognize its authority in any of the areas where it operates. Keeping this in mind, it does not come as a surprise that during the past week rumours emerged about the building used by the ‘Religious Police’ affiliated with the IS in Derna being destroyed through a bombing attack in the early hours of the morning of Saturday 21 February. Sources indicate that the ‘Abu Salim Martyrs Brigade’ might have carried out this attack. The Abu Salim Martyrs Brigade is considered the main militia hailing from Derna and ‘heading’ the local Mujahideen Shura Council. If confirmed, this news would further corroborate rumours that Derna is witnessing serious in-fighting between its various Jihadist factions, a dynamic reminiscent of those currently at play in Syria between the IS and other al-Qaeda-affiliated groups.
On the other hand, the increasingly strong presence of Jihadist groups throughout Libya still retains still the potential to inspire hysteria among western and regional stakeholders and encourage some of them to pick sides between blocks and provide economic or military supplies to their proteges. Fears among regional parties following Libya are sure to increase after the UN Security Council Panel of Experts on Libya published on Sunday 1 March an updated report focusing on events in the country throughout 2014. Among other things, the panel recommended the UN Security Council to: create a maritime monitoring force to assist the Government of Libya in securing its territorial waters to prevent the trafficking of oil, arms and related materiel. It is not unconceivable that this report will significantly alter the state of international debate surrounding a more pro-active approach towards the Libyan crisis. For the moment, on Monday 2 March, Italy’s navy started naval exercises off the coast of Libya. Despite the suspicious timing, the exercises, known as ‘Mare Aperto’ (Open Sea), are part of annual routine training courses and, according to navy representatives, are in no way connected or influenced by the current Libyan scenario. Nonetheless, the presence at sea of a large number of Italian military vessels is likely to increase the stability and security of the waters between Libya and Italy for the time being. Overall, despite the derailing of UN-backed negotiations and the inconclusiveness of this round of shuttle diplomacy by Bernardino Leon, events in and around Libya continue to flow, will this be the make or break week?
