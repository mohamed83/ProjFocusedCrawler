Egypt has called for UN-backed international intervention in Libya after launching air strikes on Islamic State (Isis) targets following the beheadings of 21 Egyptian Christians. But western governmentslook unlikely to agree.
The Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, said on Tuesday that he wanted a UN resolution mandating action to deal with the crisis. “There is no other choice, taking into account the agreement of the Libyan people and government, and that they call on us to act,” Sisi told the French radio stationEurope 1. “We will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children.”
The UN security council is scheduled to discuss Libya in an emergency session on Wednesday. Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian foreign minister, will be there. Diplomats said it was highly unlikely that a new resolution would pass.
On Monday, Egypt admitted for the first time to taking military action in Libya, sending F16 fighter aircraft to bomb Isis training camps and weapons stores there following outrage over the killings. It has previously given discreet backing to forces loyal to the Libyan general Khalifa Haftar, part of the Dignity camp which includes the internationally recognised government based in the eastern city of Tobruk. Tripoli, the capital, is the seat of a rival administration backed by Islamist and other militias, the Dawn coalition.

The brutal mass murder of Egyptian nationals in Libya was the first large-scale atrocity claimed by Isis outside its familiar heartlands in Syria and Iraq.
Strikingly, Sisi referred to the 2011 Libyan intervention, led by Nato and supported by Arab Gulf states, and which ended in the rebel overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, as an “unfinished mission”.
France has also called on the UN to adopt “measures” to confront the jihadis in Libya. Italy, the former colonial power, on Tuesday ruled out intervention without UN backing. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, said it was important to avoid “hysteria” after hawkish statements by his foreign and defence ministers. Italy is particularly preoccupied with the stream of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean from the Libyan coast.
“What is happening is very complicated,” Renzi said. “We are following events closely and with concern but there is no need to jump from total indifference to hysteria and an unreasonable reaction.”
The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, will meet Shoukry and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, to discuss Libya later this week, but she has spoken only of EU “support” for UN-approved and “Libyan-led” efforts to stabilise the country.
The British government has also been lukewarm about military action. It wants wide support for UN talks on a ceasefire and the creation of a national unity government.


We will not allow them to cut off the heads of our children

“What we face in Libya is a very difficult situation with far too many armed militias, without a proper government and with the growth of ungoverned space,” David Cameron told MPs, pledging that Britain would not “abandon” Libya.
The US seems similarly keen to avoid new military involvement after President Barack Obama famously “led from behind” in 2011, letting Nato’s European members bear the brunt of the air campaign against Gaddafi.
Deborah Jones, the US ambassador to Libya – now based in neighbouring Tunisia – expressed strong support for the UN process in an article marking Tuesday’s fourth anniversary of the start of the Libyan revolution on 17 February 2011.
 “We continue to support… UN dialogue despite the arguments of those who now insist that the urgency of the fight against Isil (Isis) makes the dialogue irrelevant,” Jones commented in the Libya Herald. “We assess that no one faction can confront alone the challenges facing Libya and create the national consensus that will enable the international community to partner effectively with Libya to establish governance and security and start to build the safe, prosperous country that Libyans deserve.”
Britain’s ambassador to Libya, Michael Aron, made a similar argument, adding: “It is absolutely critical that we all work together to tackle the threat of terrorism and extremism in Libya and the wider North Africa region.”
Egypt is already seeking international help to help combat the jihadis of Islamic State fighting in the Sinai peninsulabordering Israel and the Gaza Strip. Sisi is keen to be seen as a loyal ally of the west against violent extremism, partly in order to deflect criticism of his harsh crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt outlawed as a terrorist organisation after the overthrow of the Brotherhood president, Mohamed Morsi.
