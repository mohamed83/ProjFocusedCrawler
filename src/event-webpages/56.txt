An overcrowded migrant boat that sank with the loss of up to 400 lives capsized when passengers surged to one side to catch the attention of a passing ship, according to survivors.
The migrants were drifting in the Mediterranean a day after setting off from Libya when they spotted the commercial ship and crowded to one side, tipping the wooden fishing vessel, survivors told aid agency workers.
Many hundreds are feared to have drowned before an Italian navy ship arrived at the scene 80 nautical miles south of Lampedusa to begin a rescue operation.
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said the navy had brought 142 survivors, nearly all migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, to the southern port of Reggio Calabria. Nine bodies were recovered and brought to Trapani, on the west coast of Sicily, a spokesman added.

Survivors who spoke after arriving in Italy said one-third of the passengers were women and children, many of whom were trapped below deck when the boat capsized, according to the International Organisation for Migration.
“At the time of the shipwreck, the majority of the women and children were in the hold to protect them from cold,” said Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesman for the IOM. The men on the upper deck spotted a nearby commercial vessel and, hoping to be rescued, they all pushed to the same side of the boat until it was listing dangerously, Di Giacomo and other sources said. 
“As often happens, the boat capsized,” Di Giacomo said. “The boat was already unsafe and the water started to flood the hold and unfortunately many people died, especially those who were in the hold, especially the women and children.”
Federico Fossi, a UNHCR spokesman in Italy, said there had been about 550 people on the boat, “which brings the number of people lost at sea to around 350 to 400”.
Fossi added: “In this case the commercial ship they spotted was probably too far [away], so they had to wait for the Italian navy to come and rescue them.”

Di Giacomo said usually in such cases people start moving around on the deck because they see another boat and they are afraid they will be missed. “Many people drown immediately because they can’t swim; in the past people have drowned during the rescue procedure,” he said, adding that it would be impossible to recover all the bodies. 
It was the deadliest such incident since October 2013, UNHCR said. Save the Children said there were several young male victims, probably minors, among the nine recovered, and also children among those rescued. The survivors were picked up by the IT Orione, an Italian navy torpedo boat, which was already carrying several hundred rescued migrants from other boats, Fossi said.
Coastguard spokesman Commander Filippo Marini told AFP that since the boat capsized on Monday night they had not found any more “survivors or anything else which would indicate more victims”, but he added that the kind of vessel from which the survivors were rescued usually carried many more people.
The latest tragedy came as Italian authorities said about 8,500 migrants had been rescued at sea between Friday and Monday. Fossi said the number of rescued people had made it difficult to gather all the information on the disaster.

If the death toll is confirmed, it means the number of migrants to drown in the Mediterranean so far in 2015 remains roughly 30 times higher than the equivalent figure from 2014, which was itself a record. This latest tragedy would bring the 2015 death toll to 909, compared with 47 by the end of April 2014, according to estimates by the IOM.
Trips continued as normal along the north African coast on Wednesday, with migrants saying they are undeterred by the increased threat of drowning. One man expecting to leave on Wednesday night from the Egyptian coast, another popular launching pad for smugglers, earlier told the Guardian: “I’m determined to go whether or not there is a rescue operation. I’m risking my life for something bigger, for ambitions bigger than this.”
The disaster has renewed calls for the EU to restart full-scale search-and-rescue operations. Last October, European officials opted against creating a like-for-like replacement for Operation Mare Nostrum, an Italian-run rescue mission that saved up to 100,000 lives last year. Italy cancelled it in October, and in its place the EU runs a smaller border patrol service, amid claims that Mare Nostrum’s success was encouraging more migrants to risk death at sea.

Instead, the number of migrants at sea remains roughly the same in Mare Nostrum’s absence, and the number of deaths has spiked. “It is time to bring back the search-and-rescue capacity of the Mare Nostrum operation, this time as a collective European effort”, said Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council.
Di Giacomo said: “The Italian coastguard and navy are carrying out great work and risking their own lives. They do a wonderful job, but they don’t have the same means that Mare Nostrum had last year. With the huge number of migrants arriving in a number of days, we are very afraid that it’s not possible to save them all.
“A mechanism such as Mare Nostrum should be put in place, if possible under European consultation. People are fleeing from Libya, they don’t have a choice.”
Separately on Tuesday, the EU’s Frontex border agency said people-smugglers trying to recover a wooden boat that had been carrying migrants had fired shots into the air to warn away a coastguard vessel.
The incident took place on Monday, 60 nautical miles off the coast of Libya, after an Italian tugboat and the coastguard ship came to the rescue of 250 migrants. The coastguard vessel was carrying 342 migrants from a previous rescue.
