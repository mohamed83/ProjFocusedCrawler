What’s Behind the Surge in Refugees Crossing the Mediterranean Sea


The civil war in Libya has made it easier for smugglers to transport people through the country. As a result, the number of people fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East to reach Europe via the Mediterranean Sea has surged since last year. So far this year more than 1,800 migrants may have drowned attempting the journey.

Seeking Asylum in Europe


Many refugees sought asylum in countries like Germany and Sweden, which have been relatively open to immigrants. As the refugee surge continues, debate is growing in the European Union about the lack of unified immigration policies and funding for migrant rescue operations.
              
              
            














Sweden had the most asylum applicants per capita, with 8.4 applicants per 1,000 residents, which is nearly twice as many as the second- ranked country, Hungary.

The increase in crossings has mainly occurred on Mediterranean Sea routes to Italy, though crossings to Greece have also risen. The number of crossings is expected to remain high this year. In the first 17 days of April, 11,000 people have been rescued in the Mediterranean Sea.

Operators of vessels used to transport migrants charge Africans the equivalent of  $400 to $700 per person per trip. Syrian migrants are charged the equivalent of $1,500 per person to cross the sea, said Flavio DiGiacomo, head of communications at the International Organization for Migration. Vessels are frequently overcrowded and often unseaworthy, he said. For refugees, once the fare is paid, there is no turning back, said Mr. DiGiacomo.
              
              
            


Humanitarian organizations, which are expecting a rapid increase in the flow of refugees as the weather improves,  are concerned that a cut this year in financing for Mediterranean Sea patrol programs would hamper rescue efforts.

Many of the refugees begin their journey in the backs of trucks, which smugglers use to transport them through the desert and into Libya.

Refugees are then left to await transport in small houses where they are vulnerable to abuse, according to Mr. DiGiacomo of I.O.M. In some cases, refugees are held in detention centers until they are able to pay to leave.
