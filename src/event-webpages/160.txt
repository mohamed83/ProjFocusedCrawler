28Sep2014 			Ghadames to Host UNSMIL Brokered Talks		
It was announced today that the city of Ghadames has been picked as the site for hosting talks and negotiations between HoR representatives and its boycotting members, who have been deserting the institution since the start of its works last summer. In a bid to avoid providing Libya Dawn and its institutions with additional legitimacy, there will be no direct negotiations between the recently sworn-in al-Thinni government and members of the re-vamped GNC or of the al-Hassi government. However, despite recent declarations from HoR spokesman Faraj Hashim, outside observers expect HoR boycotters attending talks to act as full fledged Libya Dawn representatives, potentially allowing already tomorrow for the declaration of a bilateral ceasefire and exchange of prisoners. This would in turn strengthen the UNSMIL-brokered initiative and boost the possibility of reaching a political solution to the ongoing national crisis, as many of Libya’s Western partners are pushing for.
In Benghazi, meanwhile, violence continues unabated. During the past seven days, the city has witnessed a string of targeted assassinations that came as a shocker even when bearing in mind the city’s recent events and trends. Last Friday, not only were members of the security apparatuses again attacked by assailants, but, once again,young political activists were also needlessly killed. Furthermore, on Wednesday, General Haftar’s forces finally followed through with their threats of attacking ships suspected of providing  weapons and ammunition through the city’s port to militias aligned with the Benghazi’s Revolutionaries  Shoura Council.
At this stage, it then seems clear that Benghazi will remain the scene of further violence, quite possibly for an extended amount of time. Besides the fact that Operation Dignity forces are all but set to accept their eviction from the city, the willingness of extremist groups to adopt asymmetrical tactics in order to coerce the population and fulfill their political visions make it likely that even the achievement of a grand political bargain during Ghadames’ negotiations will not bring an end to the city’s current security jumble.


28Sep2014 			How to Give a Gammonish Recube (Slava vs. Lars Part II)		
This article in the May/June edition of Prime Time Backgammon explores the psychological dimensions of backgammon match play by analyzing the cube strategies of Lars Trabolt and Slava Pryadkin in their 2013 World Championship finals match. My goal was to examine those situations in which the world’s best players deliberately vary from the computer-recommended moves.  I observed that Lars Trabolt’s “non-bot plays” (I prefer not to call them errors) earlier in the match (before he fell behind significantly) were small issues of deliberate cautiousness (i.e. avoiding leaving lots of blots, not cubing/recubing when he technically should have, and dropping too early). These sub-optimal decisions could be thought of as having been forced by Praydkin’s aggressive tactics and cube play — which this article explores in more detail.  Studying the match in its entirety, I find that Slava’s doubling strategy was consistent and global: it reveals a clear plan calculated to maximize his chances against a technically superior opponent who was well versed in modern theory.
Generally, the advice to weaker players playing long matches against the best players in the world is to cube early in gammonish positions, while also taking deeply/aggressively in high-volatility situations. Study of Slava’s play provides a tutorial in this strategy. As such this article is a must read for Open-level backgammon players who wish to beat the world’s best.  This installment looks in particular at Slava’s recube to 4 trailing 20-away, 19-away. By cubing a smidge early, Slava forced Lars to take but gave himself plenty of opportunities to score a gammon and split the match right open. This recube should be understood as an example of the money strategy of ‘doubling the opponent in’ rather than ‘out’. Slava executed this flawless and the dice favoured him allowing him to pull ahead 13-6. To read the full article click here.


24Sep2014 			Al-Thinni’s New Cabinet Approved amid Preparations for Negotiation Talks		
This is proving to be a busy and eventful week for Libya. On Monday, the House of Representatives finally approved the new cabinet led by Abdullah al-Thinni. After seeing his proposed cabinets rejected twice, al-Thinni managed to overcome HoR internal fractures between federalists and members of the highly heterogeneous National Forces Alliance and to obtain a vote of confidence. In a sense, the approval of al-Thinni’s cabinet after such a long hiatus from his resignation last month was an obligatory move for the HoR at this stage. The institution is reportedly losing members on a daily basis and its inability to install a functioning executive was not simply taking a toll on its internal standing, but risked more broadly to evolve in  an insurmountable issue leading to its complete collapse and demise.
As a response to al-Thinni’s cabinet, on Wednesday the GNC sworn in new members to its own government, labeled as a national salvation one, which is headed by Omar al-Hassi. Several members of the al-Hassi government have already taken control of Ministerial buildings in Tripoli and reiterated calls for Libya’s Arab and international partners to return to Tripoli for resuming their business and diplomatic activities. Nonetheless, what the al-Hassi government cannot rely on, is the international recognition as Libya’s sole legitimate representative institution that all of the country’s partners, including Turkey and Qatar, still give to the HoR. This position was implicitly reiterated in the closing statement of  last week’s Madrid’s Ministerial Conference on stability and developments in Libya. Clearly, the legitimacy of the HoR and of the transition process for which it stands represent non-negotiable items for Libya’s international partners. This is further demonstrated by the fact that upcoming negotiations between Libya’s rival factions, which are set to start on Monday 29 September under the guidance of the UNSMIL, will adopt the following agenda, which in itself represents a defeat for the Misrata-affiliated institutional paraphernalia:

(I) Conclusion of a framework agreement on the rules of procedure of the House of Representatives (HoR) as well as an agreement on the critical issues relating to the governance of the country. Such key issues would require a qualified majority of 2/3 of the HoR membership to allow for decisions. All decisions of the HoR will be subject to the agreed upon rules of procedure.
(II) Agreement on the date, venue and ceremonial for a handover ceremony from the previous General National Congress to the current HoR.

With regards to oil production, after a temporary shut-down of the el-Sharara field and of the Zawiya refinery over the week-end, both structures are now back to work, helping Libya’s oil production to close in on the 900,000bpd mark. Two potential issues, however, emerged in the past days for the oil sector.
Firstly, tensions and armed confrontations have recently erupted in Obari, near the el-Sharara field and close to the border with Algeria. Reports indicate that Tuareg and Tubu militias have battled in and around the town after Tuareg militias prevented an attempt from Tubu groups to smuggle people from Algeria into Libya. On the other hand, rumors indicate that these confrontations might have also been spurred by recent overtures made by the Misratan establishment to local groups in the area in an attempt to obtain a direct control of oil production facilities. Secondly, after a first round of confrontations for the control of the Central Bank, Libya’s rival governments are likely to battle at an institutional level for the control of the oil sector as well. So far, the two government have adopted different approaches. Al-Thinni, in fact, has decided not to include an oil minister in his cabinet and opted to manage oil production entirely through the NOC, as in Qadhafi-era Libya. Al-Hassi, on the contrary, has appointed for the post of Minister of Oil Mashallah Zwai, who has already taken over the Oil Ministry building in Tripoli and looks ready to set off the battle for the control of Libya’s gold.


21Sep2014 			HoR Rejects Thinni’s Cabinet, Libya Dawn Tries to Restore Life in the Capital		
Appointed Prime Minister Abdullah Thinni is expected to present tonight his new cabinet to the House of Representatives after the first one he proposed a few days ago was turned down by MPs. Reports indicate that this will be Thinni’s last possibility to retain the job, after which the mandate will be given to a new candidate. Optimism, however, seems to prevail with Thinni and HoR President Ageela Saleh set to leave Tobruk after the cabinet vote will have taken place and attend the UN General Assembly in New York during the upcoming days.
Meanwhile, the two blocs dominating Libya’s politics continue to bring forth two diametrically opposed narratives. On the one hand, the HoR and the bloc it represents are still pursuing a heightened international engagement in an attempt to salvage both their status and a military campaign which has seen HoR-aligned forces lose the upper hand to Libya Dawn ones. On the other hand, for the time being, Libya Dawn forces seem very keen on freezing the current landscape, renouncing to asserti their full authority over the eastern part of the country, but forcing at the same time the HoR to accept a re-scoped role as administrator of the areas around Tobruk and Baida only as well as a general atomisation of the country’s administration. Libya Dawn Forces have also announced that refugees, expatriates and foreign diplomats should return to Tripoli where life and the security situation are back to normal, but strongly underlined that internal negotiations between rival factions are a matter pertaining to Libyan nationals only. The belated proclamation of a national state of emergency made on Thursday by newly appointed Chief of Staff Nazhuri should thus be seen as an attempt to undermine these attempts by Libya Dawn forces to see their control over the capital de facto recognised by international partners.
Furthermore, on Friday, a weapon depot belonging to Libya Dawn forces was hit by yet another air strike carried out by ‘unidentified forces’. It is unclear at this stage what are the strategic goals behind these strikes, which have so far accomplished very little from a military point of view whilst marring the internal standing and legitimacy of the HoR bloc. The strikes are also unlikely to create momentum for further military engagement given last week’s latest rejection of military intervention in the country which came from Libya’s Madrid conference.
Lastly, as previously mentioned, confrontations currently seem to have shifted from the military field to the control of the Central Bank’s (CBL) assets and organizational structure. Rori Donaghy of the Middle East Eye put together a very interesting piece on this issue, focusing on the differences between former CBL governor Elkaber and his interim replacement al-Habri, as well as on the difficulties that lie ahead for the HoR:

This split has given rise to the spectre of two CBLs emerging over the coming weeks, according to the ICG’s Gazzani.  “The Tobruk government could take over the Benghazi branch of the CBL to act as its headquarters, but it is not clear what this would mean in terms of liquidity and funds,” she said. “Up until now, the CBL in Tripoli has transferred funds to Benghazi. If there is separation of the CBL the question is: how will the Benghazi branch get money? It would require redirecting payments for oil sales from Tripoli’s main account into other subsidiary accounts.”  “That would mean a complete overhaul of the payment process for oil revenues,” she added.
 (…) The potential for two rival central banks has prompted increased fears of Libya’s international assets being frozen, which the CBL has previously warned “would lead to a loss of sovereignty and would not be in the interest of the country and its security and stability.”
(…) The ICG’s Gazzani, however, said an asset freeze could be used to pressure reconciliation between the warring political and military groups. “Freezing assets could be a means for the international community to force dialogue on both sides of the political divide and find a solution to end this impasse.”

 


19Sep2014 			Let the Scramble for Oil Money Begin		
I assume you are as thrilled as I about this morning’s result in the Scottish Independence referendum.  I feel so relieved and so proud to be living in such a participatory and level-headed democracy. I hope Americans, Catalans, Cyreniacans, and many others learn from the Scots.  The way I look at it, the Scots voted, ‘Yes’.  Some may call it ‘no’. But Scotland has decided ‘Yes’ on Continuity, National Pride, Participatory democracy, the rule of law, and the UK’s positive role in the world. Hurrah!

Now, I wanted to share with you my article that I did for AJE Opinion that came out today and touches on many of our themes… i.e. the need to invite the Misratans to the table and forestall retaliation against their being isolated.. For the article click here.


17Sep2014 			Is Operation Dignity Receiving Further Air Support from the UAE?		
Gharyan, a town south of Tripoli and allied with Operation Dawn Forces, suffered airstrikes at the hands of Operation Dignity forces on Monday. Ammunition depots belonging to Operation Dawn forces were believed to be targeted, according to locals. Meanwhile, Operation Dignity Forces loyal to former Libyan army general Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi threatened to bomb the city’s port unless authorities close the port. Also, a grad rocket hit an area close to Libya’s 120,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Zawiya west of the capital Tripoli, state news agency LANA said on Monday.
The target points of these attacks seem to share one common attribute, in that they are all strongholds of Operation Dawn. In addition to the town of Gharyan, Zawyia’s political and tribal factions have also aligned themselves with the Misratan-led Operation Dawn. The airstrikes demonstrate that Operation Dignity and its allies in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia appear to be making a push either take back the nation’s capital or show that they can still inflict damage on their enemies away from their bases in Libya’s extreme East. The anti-Islamist camp is also renewing its effort to stop the flow of weapon supplies to Islamists in Benghazi by ordering the local authorities to close the port. Despite calls to close the port in August and the instability facing the country, the port is currently still working at 70 percent of its full capacity.
It will be interesting to see if Operation Dignity-aligned forces from Zintan or Wershafena attempt to supplement these airstrikes with a ground attack. But this seems quite unlikely as Operation Dignity forces have been awfully quiet in the last month, a strategy that is most likely temporary as troops regroup, yet could be semi-permanent as the Zintanis may be a totally spent force at this point. If the latter is the case it is unclear what such airstrikes can do to tip the balance of power. They seem yet another example of a miscalculation on behalf of the Arab backers of Haftar that only further polarizes the sides and leads to sympathy for the Islamist on behalf of the population.


11Sep2014 			Why Scottish Independence is Bad for Libya		
The reality is that Scottish Independence would be bad for the Scots and certainly for all nations who benefit from having a strong United Kingdom which is able to act swiftly and functionally.  Hence I wrote an article in the LA TIMES putting for the security implications of a Scottish secession from the UK. You can read it here.  I can sympathize with many of the Scots grievances towards Westminster, yet these should be able to be reasonably alleviated without resorting to the drastic step of independence.  The answer has to be greater devolution to deal with the Scots legitimate demands for different local and regional governance. This will mean making scotland more like a US state and less like a French department… and things have been happening in this way for decades now but more devolution or what is called Devo-Max will happen and are being promised to the Scots if they vote no by Cameron and Milliband.  I think this will cause a chain effect causing Wales and North Ireland to also get devo max and this will mean the UK will be more a collection of four states than a unitary state… but this is fine and will allow the UK to still have one army, one nuclear deterrent, and one policy towards Putin and ISIS, etc. Independence is not the answer as it would weaken the UK, NATO, Europe, and the West and sap their resolve to act as a coherent force in providing peace keeping, mediation, etc. in places like Libya, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine.  All the nice vacation spots.


09Sep2014 			Libya: Stalemate or Calm before the (Return of the) Storm?		
During the past few days, developments in Libya seem to have followed a slower pace as compared to the last few months. Tripoli is reportedly in a state of uneasy calm, with schools and a few commercial areas attempting to re-open despite the fact that several families are still living outside of the capital. In Benghazi, fighting continues around the Benina airport with Operation Dignity forces entrenched there succeeding so far in resisting repeated assaults by forces of the Benghazi Rebels Shura Council umbrella group.
The current state of things, however, is unsatisfactory for all parties involved in Libya’s struggle. More than a return to stability, these days represent the calm before the return of the storm. Both sides are likely busy re-organising their ranks politically and militarily, in anticipation of an imminent resumption of intense confrontations. Even if those confrontations lack a military component it is clear that al-Hassi and al-Thinni are not compromising themselves politically.
Despite having gained military control over Tripoli, the Misratan/Islamist camp seems to be preparing to go for the jugular and deal the final blow to its adversaries. In the last few days, the General National Congress has sworn in the government formed by its appointed-PM Hassi and unsuccessfully attempted to severe diplomatic relations with the UAE and Egypt. Even more worryingly, after being emboldened by the conquest of Tripoli, it appears that the Misratan establishment has re-buffed several negotiations requests coming from the HoR. This news, alongside rumors of arms shipment coming from Sudan, legitimately raises the question of whether Operation Dawn forces are not willing to further expand the scope of the current military battle to affirm their (military) supremacy and that of the the GNC once and for all.
Finally, the House of Representatives continues to register statements of support coming from neighboring countries and international partners. On Monday, the Head of the UNSMIL mission, Bernardino Leon, visited Tobruk to discuss current developments with HoR President Ageela Issa. On the other hand, each passing day the HoR seems more and more devoid of internal strengths and capabilities. Despite initial reports, appointed-PM Abdullah Thinni has yet to present his restructured and slimmed-down cabinet. Rumors have started to emerge that the process of ministers’ selection has been complicated by contrasting political pressures coming from the federalist camp and from forces aligned with the National Forces Alliance of Mahmoud Jibril. Lastly, in what is certainly depressing news for the HoR camp, reports emerged of Libyan cadets being dismissed and repatriated from their army-training course in the UK due to an episode of insubordination. As these are not the first Libyan cadets dismissed from training, both the HoR and its international partners have been reminded once again of the inherent difficulties of building any army from scratch, let alone one with the operation capabilities and esprit de corps required for operating in the contemporary Libyan security scenario.


09Sep2014 			Is Libya the New Battleground for the Islamist-Nationalist Proxy War?		
For our Spanish speaking audience, Jason Pack and Mohamed Maher of Libya-Analysis.com recently weighed in on the Proxy War being fought in Libya by regional powers in this El Pais Article. Since the military ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi in Egypt last year, new President Abdul Fatah Sisi and his backers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have launched a campaign across the region to stop what they see as an existential threat to their authority posed by Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. The authors of the piece argue that the attack on Misratan weapon depots galvanized the Islamists in western Libya to take control of Libya. Possessing around 10,000 men and better firepower than their Zinanti counterparts, the Islamists felt that taking over Tripoli would insure that their survival in the political process. This latest military defeat for the non-Islamists has also partially destroyed the credibility of the newly elected House of Representatives. By aligning itself with Khalifa Haftar, who has vowed to crush all Islamist factions, the House of Representatives was unable to entice even moderate Islamists to recognize the newly elected institution.


02Sep2014 			Thinni Given PM Mandate as Libya Dawn Tries to Put Facts on the Ground		
As expected after his resignation of a few days ago, Abdullah Thinni has been given a new mandate as Prime Minister, this time by the House of Representatives, and has now two weeks to form a new cabinet. Media reports indicate that Thinni has been asked to put together a slimmed down cabinet, with the hope that this, alongside a full and not Caretaker mandate, will enable him to achieve the results required to gather enough consensus to defuse the current crisis.
Meanwhile, in Tripoli, forces belonging to the Libya Dawn operation are trying to put facts on the ground and project an aura of legitimacy and sovereignty. As reported today by David Kirkpatrick for the New York Times, despite announcements from the government that ministerial buildings and state infrastructures in the capital were not safe due to militia presence, after a month long battle the perception in the streets seems to be a different one.
Residents of Tripoli said Monday that life was beginning to return to the city after a month of fighting. Businesses that had been closed were beginning to reopen, gas and electricity shortages were becoming less severe, and traffic was returning to the streets.
But the victors in the fight have also attacked and burned the homes of people accused of backing the other side; one target was the home of Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni.
Reports emerged that indiscriminate attacks targeted also the Tawerghan refugee camp located in Tripoli.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that a potential ‘Ghariani Case’ materialised and rapidly dissolved in the UK over the weekend. As the Guardian revealed that the Libyan Mufti was currently based in England, questions arose with regards to the legitimacy of his stay in the country, particularly in light of the statements Ghariani made in the past months with regards to the legitimacy of Ansar al-Shari’a as well as with his more recent statements directed against the HoR and inciting Libya Dawn forces to use the iron fist in Tripoli. Ghariani is now said to be in Qatar, one of the country rumored to be most involved in the proxy war that Libya is becoming.
