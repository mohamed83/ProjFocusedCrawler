European leaders pledge to send ships to Mediterranean to pick up migrants









At emergency summit, Britain is first to promise ships for search-and-rescue missions in an EU effort described as ‘woefully inadequate’ by Amnesty

European leaders committed to send naval assets to the Mediterranean on Thursday evening in an attempt, described as “woefully inadequate” by Amnesty International, to get to grips with the epidemic of migrant drownings at sea.
At an emergency summit in Brussels staged under intense pressure to respond more humanely to the mounting death toll, Britain was the first to pledge ships and helicopters. It ordered the Royal Navy flagship, HMS Bulwark, to Malta to join search-and-rescue operations after the death of up to 800 people last weekend in the worst single tragedy in the Mediterranean for two years.
David Cameron also said two smaller cutters or patrol vessels would be sent, as well as three Merlin helicopters fitted with advanced radar capable of spotting small craft at sea from a range of 100 miles.
Germany was also said to have offered at least one frigate, while Ireland promised one fully crewed and equipped boat. There were certain to be further pledges.
Despite previous British government opposition to saving lives at sea, the prime minister’s U-turn on search-and-rescue came with conditions attached. He said any migrants picked up at sea would not necessarily qualify to claim asylum in Britain, but would be taken to the nearest EU country, probably Italy. Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, was said not to have objected when he met Cameron just before the summit.
“Today’s meeting has got to be about saving lives. Of course, saving lives means rescuing these poor people, but it also means smashing the gangs and stabilising the region,” said Cameron.
 HMS Bulwark, currently taking part in first world war commemorations at Gallipoli in Turkey, is expected to be operational on search-and-rescue duties in the Mediterranean in about a week and will be based at Malta, UK government sources said.

While leaders stressed the paramount aim was to save lives, the summit was expected to focus on security in what looked like a vain attempt to stem the flow of refugees from north Africa.
The summit was called at short notice in reaction to the deaths of an estimated 800 migrants off the coast of Libya last weekend, who drowned when their shoddy fishing trawler capsized during their attempt to flee sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East for southern Europe.
Earlier on Thursday, 24 coffins containing the only bodies recovered from the capsizing were laid out for an inter-faith memorial service in the grounds of Malta’s main hospital. The ceremony included Christian and Muslim prayers and was attended by Malta’s president and prime minister, Italy’s interior minister and the EU’s migration commissioner.

Under draft policy proposals prepared for the leaders, the EU is for the first time mulling a military mission aimed at impounding and destroying the vessels used by smugglers to send the migrants on their perilous voyages. A draft summit statement said the aim was to destroy the vessels before they depart, suggesting European forces would need to take to the beaches and ports of Libya.
 Senior EU officials refused to be drawn on the details and diplomats said the plans were sketchy and imprecise, hastily announced in a kneejerk response to last weekend’s tragedy.
 The leaders would need to decide whether military action was possible, said a senior EU diplomat. Apache helicopter gunships attacking smugglers’ vessels from a range of up to 2km would be the optimal way to operate, diplomatic sources said, arguing against “boots on the ground”.
Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign and security policy coordinator, is to be asked to come up with a military mission blueprint. Diplomats said this could take several months and even up to a year. Military action would also probably require a UN security council mandate and would probably run into a Russian veto.
Donald Tusk, the president of the European council and chair of the summit, said the priority for EU leaders was to decide on swift action to save lives in the Mediterranean. But there is widespread concern among immigration professionals that the proposals on offer will have little quick effect on rescuing migrants at a time when the death toll is soaring. According to the UN and the International Organisation for Migration, 1,776 people are dead or missing so far this year, compared with 56 for the same period last year.
The leaders are expected to pledge to more than double funding for the EU’s Triton maritime mission, which patrols Italy’s territorial waters, and to say that the operation’s search-and-rescue operations are to be extended. 
The maritime operation is run by the EU’s Warsaw-based borders agency, Frontex, which has a shoestring budget and no military assets. Its mandate is to monitor the external borders of the EU’s Schengen free-travel zone, not to save people in distress. There has been no proposal to change the mandate although Triton is also saving migrants at risk.
Amnesty International described the measures being discussed as “a woefully inadequate and shameful response to the crisis in the Mediterranean that will fail to end the spiral of deaths at sea”.

 The leaders of the four biggest EU countries, Germany, France, Britain and Italy, met before the summit to plot their options. Cameron has performed a U-turn in recent days, agreeing to the need for more extensive search-and-rescue operations in the waters south of Sicily, after the government strongly criticised Italian rescue efforts last year and refused to take part in the Triton mission on the grounds that saving lives just encouraged a greater flow of migrants and emboldened the traffickers.
 Government officials now admit that Triton has not worked and that more has to be done.
 Germany, France and the Netherlands were similarly critical of the Italian operations last year, which were called off and replaced by the much less ambitious and cheaper Triton mission.
 The argument that Italy’s Mare Nostrum operation served as a “pull factor” has not been vindicated. According to Frontex, in the first three months after Triton replaced Mare Nostrum, the flow of migrants increased 160%.
 “Reluctant governments should realise that overemphasising the ‘pull effect’ is not only factually incorrect but also morally indefensible,” said the Centre for European Reform thinktank in a policy analysis on Thursday.
 Other “fortress Europe” measures being considered included demands that the frontline states of Italy, Malta and Greece fingerprint every person who arrives across the Mediterranean, that quicker repatriation be organised for “irregulars” who fail to qualify for asylum, and that the EU establishes offices in the countries neighbouring Libya to gather intelligence on, and try to stem the flow of, migrants.
 The heads of the UN refugee agency and human rights commission and of the International Organisation for Migration denounced the action being discussed as grossly inadequate given the scale of the crisis.
 “A tragedy of epic proportions is unfolding in the Mediterranean,” they said. “The EU response needs to go beyond the present minimalist approach which focuses primarily on stemming the arrival of migrants and refugees on its shores. Enforcement alone will not solve the issue of irregular migration, but could increase the risks and abuse faced by migrants and refugees.”

 With refugee admissions policies very much the remit of national governments, there will also be modest attempts to inaugurate a refugee-sharing system involving a pilot scheme where EU member states “volunteer” to divide up 5,000 refugees between them. They would have to be recognised by international agencies as qualifying for protection and would be spared the risks of the sea passage.
 Diplomats and officials admitted the package of proposals had been cobbled together in a hurry by the European commission as a result of the public clamour for action after last weekend’s disaster, and that putting any agreements into effect would take several months at least.
 But in the short term it appeared that maritime patrols in the Mediterranean and search-and-rescue missions would be beefed up considerably.
