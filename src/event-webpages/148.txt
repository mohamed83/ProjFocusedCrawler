Nigel Farage has warned against “waves of millions” of people from Africa coming to Europe if the EU agrees a common policy for tackling migrant deaths in the Mediterranean.
In the wake of two boat disasters in which hundreds of migrants have drowned, the Ukip leader said he opposed EU action to address the problem as it could lead to a common migration policy.
The UK government has until now resisted EU search and rescue efforts but David Cameron signalled this week that he will be in favour of the UK joining joint action when he attends a meeting of leaders on Thursday.
But in comments on ITV News at Ten, Farage said he thought the UK could send in the Royal Navy but should have no part in the EU-wide efforts.
Farage said: “I’m happy to send the Royal Navy, I’m happy to stop people drowning in the Mediterranean. But it needs the cooperation of the Italian and Greek governments to say we cannot accept an unlimited number of people crossing over. If that message is not sent, many millions of people will come.”
Farage said he could not be “accused of being closed-minded” as he had been in favour of accepting some Christian refugees from Syria.
“But waves of millions of people coming from north Africa seeking a better life in Europe, if that links in on Thursday to a new common migration policy then whilst on one hand it may appear to be the decent thing to do, I think you’ll find overwhelmingly public opinion will say we simply can’t,” he said.
On Sunday, Farage blamed Cameron’s part in removing Muammar Gaddafi from Libya for causing the movement of migrants and said he thought the UK could take some Christian refugees.
Pressed on why he only thought Christian refugees should be accepted, the Ukip leader said it was because they have nowhere else to go. “I have said all the way though I particularly feel the plight of Christians because they have nowhere to go in that region,” he said. “I would happily take some Christian refugees ... Because they have nowhere to go as a direct result of what we’ve done.”
Asked about where Britain should draw the line when it comes to accepting refugees and saving lives, he said: “I’ve already said I’m prepared to accept some people that have literally nowhere to go but beyond that, I’m sorry we cannot have yet another unlimited wave coming into Britain. I’m prepared to redirect part of the foreign budget, part of our EU contributions, and sending the Royal Navy to help stop people drowning in the Mediterranean. I’m prepared to do a lot but we cannot open our doors again to unlimited numbers.”
Farage accused the EU of using the disaster as an excuse to call for common policies and further extensions of its powers, but his comments may lead to similar accusations that he is exploiting the tragedy to make points about Brussels and immigration.
