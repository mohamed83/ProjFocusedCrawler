29Apr2013 			Libya Gunmen Surround Tripoli Foreign Ministry		
Well in the latest very bad development the struggle between the militias and the central government has become overt with militiamen attempting to not only sway the votes on the Political Isolation law but to shut down the government if it doesn’t not cave in to their demands.  Why the national army or Libya Shield forces are not called in to deal with this situation is insane, in short it bodes very ill for the creation of any sort of functioning central government if the militias get their way, but the GNC has followed the NTC in pretty much always caving in….  Read more about it from the BBC here.
Men in pick-up trucks bristling with anti-aircraft guns have blocked off Libya’s foreign ministry, demanding a jobs ban on Gaddafi-era officials.
Prime Minister Ali Zeidan, at a news conference, urged Libyans to back their government in the face of “people who want to destabilise the country”.
He also complained of other attacks and “acts of sabotage”, carried out by separate groups, against the interior ministry and national TV headquarters. But Libya’s Lana news agency said the action at the interior ministry was not linked to the events outside the foreign ministry.


23Apr2013 			French Embassy in Libya Attacked		
The latest depressing news from the NYT.
The explosion of a car parked outside the French Embassy in Libya wounded two French guards on Tuesday in what appeared to be the first major terrorist attack on a diplomatic compound in the capital since the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011.
No one claimed responsibility Tuesday, following the pattern of earlier attacks. But Libyans immediately suspected militant Islamists angry over the French intervention in Mali, where French troops are supporting government efforts to oppose Islamic militants in the north of the country. The assault came a day after the French Parliament voted to extend the French military deployment there.
In January, Italy, the former colonial power in Libya, closed its consulate in Benghazi and withdrew its staff because of security concerns after an attempted ambush of the Italian consul. Last month, Libyan security officials said they had arrested two men in the kidnapping near Benghazi of five British humanitarian activists, at least two of them women who had been sexually assaulted.
The attack on the French Embassy, however, may raise new questions about the possibility that militants may now try to strike other targets in the capital as well. The country as a whole is viewed by outsiders as potentially perilous with many weapons in the hands of citizens and militias beyond government control. Most foreigners in Tripoli take elaborate security precautions.


12Apr2013 			The Constituent Assembly Will Be Elected		
Read it and weep. As always the Libya Herald sums it up in the clearest fashion.  The GNC has finally decided to pass the buck on its responsibility and true reason d’etre. And the way is paved for the GNC to further cave in to the populist demands of the Jacobins in the form of a self-defeating political isolation law.  I tend to be optimistic about Libyan affairs but the events of the last months have made it truly difficult. But in this instance the only positive thing is that at least the GNC has made a definitive decision and the limbo that has existed on this question since 5 July 2012 is now over.
The General National Congress last night confirmed that the assembly that will draft Libya’s new Constitution shall be elected, as opposed to nominated, ending a long drawn-out debate that had kept Congress members from agreeing on other critical issues.
With regards to the isolation law that is yet to be passed, the GNC resolved that it was not unconstitutional and could not be overruled by the Supreme Court.
Having decided that the political isolation law project is constitutionally acceptable, as long as it complies with international conventions and human rights, the GNC can now focus on elaborating the final text that many in Libya are awaiting with impatience.


06Apr2013 			GNC Stalemate on Process for Selecting “Committee of 60″		
Here is an excellent article by Sami Zaptia about the crucial legal, structural, and  populist issues preventing the GNC from moving forward on selecting or electing the Constitutional Committee.  This is a must read for all interested in Libya’s thorniest political  issues.
Initially, the TCD in August 2011 stipulated that the 60 are chosen by the GNC. However, on the last day of its tenure in 2012, the National Transitional Council (NTC), headed by Mustafa Abdul Jalil, amended the TCD so that the 60 must be elected by the general public.It is believed that the NTC was forced to make this amendment in order to calm demands by Federalists in eastern Libya and in the face of a threat of a boycott of the 2012 GNC elections in the east.
For months after the elections, the GNC, feeling that it has the ultimate legitimacy and sovereignty, attempted to avoid the more troublesome process of election, preferring the easier selection route. However, under much political pressure, demonstrations and even armed attacks on its building, it caved in and announced that the 60 will be elected.Only weeks later after reaching that decision, the whole subject was turned on its head again as the Constitutional Court revoked the NTC amendment, declaring it unconstitutional, meaning that the GNC could, after all, select the 60.
On Tuesday the GNC was yet again unable to find consensus and reach a decision they could sell to the general public. Its members are still torn between sticking to their first instinct to select the 60 or giving-in to populist demands to elect the 60. Ultimately, they have decided to yet again postpone a vote on the issue to at least next week. A constitutional amendment to adjust the means of selecting the 60 needs a two-thirds majority. GNC members feel that they are unable to achieve such a high threshold. They are therefore considering whether to remove the two-thirds threshold requirement for the amendment, as a way to break the impasse.


06Apr2013 			John McCain in Libya		
Senator John McCain made his fifth visit to Libya since the fall of Qadhafi on April 4, meeting with Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zidan, President of the General National Congress Mohamed Magarief, other officials, and NGOs. Top among the issues they discussed were the ongoing investigation into the death of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, and the future of U.S.-Libya defense cooperation.
When the Libya Herald asked Senator McCain to explain U.S. policy in providing security assistance, he replied that the “US will help with training and equipment…only if it were requested by the Libyan government – as determined by the needs of the Libyan government and Libyan people”. Any such technical assistance would not include U.S. troops on the ground acting as Libyan defense forces. Apparently there have been rumors on social media sites that NATO forces will return to Libya to make up for the shortcomings in Libya’s own military – leading to the Prime Minister’s office issuing a statement denying any such rumors.
Hopefully the U.S. government will continue to provide security assistance to Libya – vital to both the security of the Mediterranean and the Sahel – when requested.


03Apr2013 			Opinion: Libya – Technological Colony – To Be or Not to Be?		
Here is a fascinating article about spurring technological development in the Libya Herald building on my article with Abullah Elmaazi in AJE.
Libya is blessed with energy resources which include petroleum, natural gas and materials from its vast desert land. There is the (justifiable) temptation to export as much as possible at the highest rate possible to generate the cash flow needed for the rapid building of the nation in the wake of the disastrous 40+ years of neglect. This, of course, is the right path; to build modern infrastructure, roads, schools, hospitals, and investing in future generations. But is it enough?
Per Chatham House’s 2012 Report ‘Resources Futures’[2], Libya holds fourth place in the largest bilateral resource trade relationships in fossil fuels: exporting crude oil to the EU27 at a value of 28.8 ($ bn). Libya is also one of the producer countries placed in high rank in vulnerability to international commodity price fluctuations. Producer countries particularly exposed to macroeconomic shocks from commodity price fluctuations are those whose i) their economies are particularly dependent on exports and ii) commodities account for a significant share of exports.
Continued economic growth based solely on natural Libyan resources simply further advance others’ technological advancements. The country has great human resources yet very little job creating capacity to absorb them. Without more focused development in Libyan technological sectors such as solar energy and water salination projects, etc., it is feasible that the end result will be to perpetuate Libyan dependence on other people’s technology – referred to as ‘technology colonization’.
 


03Apr2013 			Hisham Matar on NPR’s Fresh Air		
Terry Gross interviewed Matar about his father and his recent article “The Return,” published in this week’s edition of the New Yorker. Matar — author of In the Country of Men – is a novelist who divides his time between New York and London.
Hisham Matar, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So when you set out for Libya, to see if you could find your father who had been imprisoned for many years, the last you’d heard of him was in 2010, you learned that somebody had seen him or said that they’d seen him in prison in 2002. So you really had no idea if he was alive or not. So when you go to Libya looking for your father, where do you start? What was the plan?
I’m going to try to sum up why your father was considered an enemy of the Gadhafi regime. So tell me if this is accurate. He had been in the military under the king, and then when the coup overthrew the king, and Gadhafi became president, your father was given a diplomatic position in the Libyan Permanent Mission to the U.N., largely to get rid of him without alienating him as a military man and risking turning military men against the regime. But then your father decided to continue to fight the Gadhafi regime and ran a militia that hoped to depose Gadhafi. Do I have that right?


02Apr2013 			Advisor to Libya PM ‘Abducted’		
The latest happy news from Libya is that the PM’s chief of staff, Mohammad Ghatous, was abducted by the militiamen he was  trying to negotiate with.
Ghatous’ disappearance comes less than a week after Zidan was besieged in his office by fighters who demanded his ouster over remarks he made threatening to summon outside help to confront the armed groups. On Sunday, the same day that Ghatous disappeared, dozens of fighters surrounded the justice ministry in a daylong siege and also called for minister Salah al-Marghani’s resignation.
Al-Marghani had told a Libyan TV station that some of the fighters were illegitimate groups and were operating illegal prisons. He demanded that they relinquish control over them to the justice ministry. Zidan and al-Marghani also held a joint news conference on Sunday, saying that fighters would be held accountable for any attacks.
