Rescue efforts are underway off the coast of Libya. (Source: CIA/Wikicommons)


(RNN) - A boat carrying an estimated 650 people migrating to Europe capsized overnight off the coast of Libya.Fewer than 50 people have been rescued so far, Malta's Prime Minister Muscat said via Twitter, but hundreds are missing from the vessel, which had multiple levels. The Associated Press is reporting 24 are confirmed dead and as many as 50 have been rescued, but the survivor numbers are from conflicting sources and are unverified.Italian ships, the Maltese Navy and commercials vessels were searching for survivors about 70 miles north of the Libyan coast.Migrants have been fleeing the chaos in Libya and elsewhere in increasing numbers, risking a dangerous Mediterranean crossing to reach Europe. Pope Francis recently has called for Europe to do more to address the migrant crisis.He praised Italy for their efforts to help the migrants that flock to its shores, but added "It's evident that the proportions of the phenomenon require much broader involvement." Italy has rescued more than 200,000 people at sea since the start of 2014, the Associated Press reported.Copyright 2015 Raycom News Network. All rights reserved.
