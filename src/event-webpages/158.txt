31Jul2014 			Ansar Al-Sharia Claim Islamic Emirate in Benghazi		
Libya’s Islamist militant group Ansar al-Sharia has said that it seized complete control of Benghazi late on Wednesday, declaring the city an “Islamic emirate,” the group’s representative said. The rebels inflicted a major defeat on Special Forces loyal to retired Major General Khalifa Haftar. Scores of his troops were killed in battles over the past few days. A well-informed source in Benghazi claims that Haftar left for Egypt in order to spend Eid with members of his family who live there. Hafar, however, has denied these claims.
The military success of Ansar Al-Sharia exacerbates a complex situation in Libya. With the House of Representatives set to convene on the 4th of August in Benghazi, Ansar Al-Sharia will surely seize every opportunity to destabilize the fragile government institution. Activist Yusuf Al-Qumati said that the Muslim Brotherhood and those who are close to the movement should determine their position regarding the attempts to undermine the state project in which they participate by virtue of the power-sharing arrangement.
It will be very interesting to see if this recent gain made by Ansar Al-Sharia will last. Haftar stated that the national Libyan army is in control of Benghazi and only withdrew from certain positions for tactical reasons. However, circles close to Haftar attributed the defeat of his forces to the failure of the east Libyan tribes to stand by him as well as to having faith in an appeal for a ceasefire made by former Provisional Council Head Mustafa Abd Al-Jalil.


30Jul2014 			Libya on the Brink: How to Stop the Fighting		
As the situation in Libya deteriorates towards the end of July 2014, Western countries are debating three key options: withdrawal, mediation, and intervention.  The issue is complicated by the security situation which requires withdrawing or protecting diplomatic personnel, while simultaneously attempting to stay appraised of developments on the ground which are happening at breakneck speed.  I have waded into these debates with an article in Foreign Affairs, which as a publication tends to reach the upper echelons of the American policymaking establishment. I put forth the case for mediation in that article and criticize the American decision to entirely withdraw its Embassy and to do so in a disgraceful Saigon-esque fashion.
These are the same issues I debate on TV with my close friends Richard Northern and Karim Mezran on Al Jazeera’s flagship talking heads programme, “Inside Story.” I think it was the best TV show i’ve yet been on and I hope you watch it and enjoy it by clicking here.


30Jul2014 			Libya Back in the Limelight, Will Actors on The Ground Capitalize from it?		
As written yesterday and in the previous days, the ongoing crisis in Libya is deepening with no side capable of achieving a significant breakthrough, whether in battle or in negotiations. This violent stalemate has progressively engulfed civilian areas and state infrastructures into the battle, spurring several Libyans to temporarily abandon the country via land routes to “wait out” the fighting.
In an article for the New York Times, Kareem Fahim reflects on the symbolic and moral importance that the devastation occurred in Tripoli’s airport has had in spurring people to leave:
The battle for the airport has left it a gutted symbol of a disintegrating state. Lost in the rubble of the airport was the sense of collective purpose that seemed to unite Libyans not so long ago, during the revolt.
“If you’re willing to destroy your airport — that idea of national sovereignty, that we’re all in this together, then the issue of national identity is simply not as important as everyone thought it would be,” said Dirk Vandewalle, an associate professor at Dartmouth College and an expert on Libya who has visited regularly since the revolution.
Realising that the latest Libyan crisis was not going to defuse itself from within, as it often happened in the recent past, international actors have increased their focus on events. The renewed sense of urgency about Libya is well reflect by a recent tweet of Italy’s PM Matteo Renzi, who indicated events in the north African country as his only serious concern in this moment. However, it remains unclear what this renewed interest will concretely translate into and if any actor on the ground will be able to capitalise from it.
The Libya Herald quoted Libya’s UN representative Ibrahim al-Dabashi threatening militias with a statement hinting at a possible hands-on approach from Western countries to the ongoing violence, as seen in 2011, and to future prosecution from the ICC. However, a conference call between US and EU leaders has so far led to a mere renewal of statements of support for the House of Representatives and for a bigger role to be played by the UN. Messages coming from the ground are likely to further embolden militias in their battle, as diplomatic missions are being progressively shut down and foreign expats evacuated from the country, the Libyan government struggle to gather international support for extinguishing the fire in Tripoli fuel tankers. Furthermore, public opinion in Western countries seems to be headed in a different direction than in 2011. This s well reflected by the wealth of op-eds and articles that are being published in these hours portraying and analysing events in Libya only through the prism of the NATO-led intervention; focusing on settling old scores of internal politics and over-exaggerating the importance that Western countries have had in the brewing of the ongoing crisis.


29Jul2014 			No Eid Celebrations as Libya Descends into Chaos		
Even though Monday marked the first day of ‘Eid al-Fitr, Libya witnessed a further descent into chaos with increased fighting and destruction in both Tripoli and Benghazi. In the eastern city, Islamist aligned forces launched a counter-offensive that culminated in the conquest of a key Saiqa base in the Bu Attni district, which also comprised training facilities and the headquarters of the 21st Battalion.
Furthermore, reports of a barrage of rockets targeting the Tibesti Hotel and nearby Istiqlal street, where the House of Representatives is set to gather next week, circulated yesterday. These reports should be seen as a further proof that the escalation in violence witnessed throughout the country is the result of a tactical choice taken from certain factions to derail the political transition whilst avoiding to openly reject electoral results, a move that could have proved far riskier in attracting a speedy external intervention.
In Tripoli fighting between Zintani and Misratan forces continued largely unabated despite major collateral damages. On Monday, a fuel depot located nearby the airport was set on fire as a result of ongoing clashes in the area. The fire there has now been declared out of control and has reached another tank, forcing Libyan authorities to plea for external support. A third tank has been reportedly hit today without further consequences.
In other developments, after the failed attempt of the past days, caretaker Prime Minister Thinni and the government have effectively relocated in al-Baida, in an attempt to try and tackle the ongoing crisis from a different perspective and  broker a first ceasefire in Benghazi. Mustafa Abdul Jalil also made his voice heard again, talking as the head of the Libyan Council of Notables assembled by the government to facilitate negotiations, the former Chairman of the NTC issued a communicate inviting all parties involved in the Tripoli fights to comply with previously brokered ceasefire agreements. Finally, in the relatively calmer south, the Libya Herald reports that a consensus is coalescing between various and often opposing forces, such as Tebus, Tuareg and the Zwai tribe, announcing their support and material assistance for the Zintani-Operation Dignity block.
As for oil fields and their output, Samir Salim Kamal is quoted by Reuters as saying that ongoing fighting has spared oil related infrastructures and that the fuel depots on fire in Tripoli were destined to local consumption:
“I can confirm that all the oilfields are safe and the production is still around 500,000 bpd,” Samir Salim Kamal, director of planning at the Libyan Oil Ministry, told Reuters. He declined to say from which day the figure was or to give further details.
Two weeks ago, Libya’s oil production has risen to 588,000 bpd but it has fallen since the clashes have started over the capital’s international airport. It was unclear if the Brega oil port has started operating after the government had reached a deal with protesting security guards to end strikes.
 


27Jul2014 			Calls for Dialogue Fall on Deaf Ears as Militias Get Entrenched in Battle		
As no major development occurred in Libya throughout the weekend, warring sides seem to prepare themselves for a long-lasting and consuming confrontation. Fears that opposing factions will not agree to a ceasefire, let alone come to a peaceful settling of their disputes, are well reflected by the evacuation of the US Embassy in Tripoli, occurred on Saturday morning amid exceptional security measures.
In an article for the Financial Times, Borzou Daraghi focuses on the increasing risk of a Beirut-like scenario for Tripoli. As rival forces eschew areas of influence in different neighborhoods, the airport highway is increasingly playing the role of a novel Green Line, separating forces representing more and more nation-wide opposing blocks and not just the cities of Zintan and Misrata. The article does also a good job of presenting various voices on the ground, reminding us of the individual-level dimension of the crisis and, even more importantly, highlighting how the lackluster developments occurred in Libya during the last three years are marring the strength of the existing social fabric.
At the international level, Special Envoys for Libya from a number of countries and international organisations met on Thursday in Brussels to discuss the ongoing crisis. In their concluding statement, they called yet-again on all parties involved in the crisis for dialogue, while also invoking a more decisive role to be played by the UN in brokering a ceasefire. However, the concomitance of the latest Gaza crisis and of the diplomatic efforts surrounding it surely do not help the international community, and other major regional players like Egypt, to adequately focus on Libyan events. Calls for peaceful negotiations were renewed by the Libyan Government as well through a statement underlying the symbolic importance that the imminent ‘Eid al-Fitr could play in favoring reconciliation.
Finally, the ‘Shura Council of the Youth of Islam’ in Derna issued a statement concerning the arrest, judgment and execution of an Egyptian and Libyan man suspected of murder. The two were sentenced to death by the Shari’a Council of the organization and then handed over to blood relatives of the murder’s victim for carrying out the sentence. Clearly, this event marks an unequivocal attempt by this recently formed Jihadist group to follow the blueprint of other Somali and Iraqi organisations and establish itself not just as a provider of security and charity work, but as an overall alternative for the failing state apparatuses. Putting this and the above developments in perspective, underlines how strongly Libya needs to quickly put an end to the ongoing violent stalemate and prevent the mushrooming of peripheral pockets of institutionalised dissent.


25Jul2014 			Will the House of Representatives be nipped in the bud by ongoing violence?		
The question on every one’s tongue is will the House of Representatives be nipped in the bud by ongoing violence or will it be able to establish traction against the militias due to its democratic mandate? As clashes have not abated around Tripoli’s airport, a surge in violence has been registered during the past days in Benghazi. Military bases belonging to Saiqa Special Forces have been targeted by repeated attacks and suicide bombings from the Islamist side, leading in turn to a resumption of aerial attacks from the Benina airbase. Furthermore, Saiqa Commander Wanis Bukhamada publicly called for reinforcements to be sent in support of the fight against ‘terrorists’ and for a clear statement on these events to be issued by the Government.
For his part, in a speech to the Libyan people Wednesday night, caretaker Prime Minister Abdullah Thinni reiterated calls for dialogue and restraint, calling in particular on the cities of Zintan and Misrata due to the role played by militias from these cities in recent Tripoli’s airport clashes. Yet when he attempted to go to Tubroq, he was prevented from using Maitiga airport by the Islamist militias that control it.
At the high politics level, despite national and  international calls for an immediate transition, the GNC has set August 4th as the date for transferring power to the House of Representatives. It is worth wondering if delaying the transfer of power any further does not run the risk of presenting the new legislative body with an insurmountable and degenerated security situation. Furthermore, since no actor on Libya’s political scene currently possesses the strength to break the ongoing stalemate or tackle it, postponing the work of the House of Representatives can be seen as a bid to wear out the legitimacy of this newly-elected body and to nip its potential in the bud. GNC member Abdullah al-Qamaty from Qaminis openly hinted at this possibility, framing ongoing violence in Western Libya as an attempt to prevent institutional transfer of power.
Lastly, as expected, widespread violence and instability took their toll on Libya’s oil output as well. More details on this can be found in Aiman al-Warfalli and Ahmed Elumami piece for Euronews:
The El-Feel oilfield last week was forced to cut back due to clashes in Tripoli, where the two rival brigades of militias have fought over control of the airport. El-Feel, operated by state-run National Oil Corporation and Italy’s ENI, is protected by security guards from the northwestern Zintan region, whose fighters also protect the airport where clashes have gone on for a week. National Oil Company spokesman Mohamed El Harari said output as of Monday was around 450,000 bpd compared with 555,000 bpd on Thursday.
Still, oil industry progress remains in flux. One of Libya’s ports, Brega, is expected to be operating within a “few days” after the government reached a deal with protesting security guards to end a blockade, NOC’s Harari said.
According to Reuters AIS Live tanker tracking service, no tankers had loaded so far at Brega. One crude shipment left the 230,000 barrels-per-day Zawiya port, supplied by the El Sharara oilfield, which was recently reopened. The Olympic Spirit II, carrying Aframax, crude oil, headed to the Spanish port of Bilbao having left July 20.


25Jul2014 			Violence in the Capital Escalates as The Government Struggles to Sell Crude		
Heavy fighting around Tripoli airport has hit a fuel tanker, as an escalation of violence in Libya damages the oil infrastructure for the first time. The fuel tanker, which was close to the airport, burst into flames after being hit by a missile, according to statements and videos posted on the airport’s Facebook page. Underscoring Libya’s chaos, acting Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni and other ministers said were prevented by militias from using the Mitiga Airport to fly to the eastern city of Tobruk. Mitiga, used mostly for military and oil company flights, has been opened to limited international flights since the clashes erupted and Tripoli International Airport was closed.
The undesired consequences as a result of the fighting taking places keep rising. Turkey may evacuate its embassy in the Libyan capital of Tripoli; Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said on Thursday, a day after his ministry advised all Turkish citizens to leave the North African country due to the worsening security situation. This is a big blow to the fragile Libyan government, which has witnessed the exodus of a few hundred Turks in Libya in recent months. Adding to the diplomatic blow are reports that the government is preparing a new pricing strategy for its crude exports that may include further discounts after a sales offer last week failed because potential buyers offered “unacceptable” prices, according to state-run National Oil Corporation. Libya plans to offer different crude prices before the end of next month that will compensate customers for the additional risk of loading oil in the country, Ahmed Shawki, marketing director at National Oil, said by phone from Tripoli today. The country reduced July export prices for seven grades of crude by as much as US $1.90 a barrel, according to a price list from National Oil obtained by Bloomberg News on July 18.
Although the situation seems extremely dire, there are grassroots movements on the ground that may be decisive in breaking the stalemate on the ground. Reports are circulating that Zintan’s tribal elders travelled to Al Baida to discuss the situation with some of Eastern Libya’s elders. Brigades from the southwestern city of Kufra have also threatened that they will side with the Zintan militias in order to stop the escalation of violence in the capital city.


23Jul2014 			Are the Parliamentary Elections a Precursor for More Violence?		
The electoral commission finally announced the results of the winners of individual seats in the June 25 poll a day late and at a time when as clashes for control of Tripoli airport take place. Liberal factions appear to be the big winners, unlike the former General National Congress (GNC) which was dominated by Islamists. Benghazi Deputy Younes Fannouch estimated that the Islamists have not won more than 30 seats. He also added that he believes the Liberal factions won 50 seats and the Cyrenaican Federalists garnered 25 seats. Twelve of the 200 seats have not been attributed as the vote in certain polling stations was annulled due to suspected electoral fraud. The remaining 80 seats will go to independents, who Fannouch claims are “opposed to Islamic politics”. The list of successful candidates, along with their photograph, is available on this spreadsheet.  The conflict around the Airport has not ceased, with the death toll climbing to 50 after the first week.
The implications of this election can make an already complex situation worse. A defeat in the parliamentary election and the relocation of the only legislative authority in the country to Benghazi will likely lead to stronger coordination and unity between the Islamist militias in Benghazi and Misruata to undermine the NFA-Federalist alliance. If this situation were to unfold, the house of parliament would likely become as inactive as its predecessor, the General National Congress, since the Islamist militias will leverage every opportunity to challenge the government with force and violence. Simply put, the Islamist militias will not allow any political or military faction to undercut their capability to coerce the weakened government to pay salaries and benefits to its members.
As the consolidation process takes place under the Islamist and Nationalist ideologies, only 2 possible scenarios can end this vicious cycle of violence. The simpler situation would be to negotiate a grand bargain between the major political factions. Complicating this option, however, is the need to balance the needs of the militias and the public’s willingness to appease the militias, which will be crucial for the democratic process. The other alternative is to sway the balance of military power in the favor of the more popular Nationalist forces. Although this is a much bloodier and time-consuming process, it may ultimately be the only way to break the stalemate on the ground between two rigid forces.


22Jul2014 			As Fighting in the Captial Intensifies Zintanis Hold Airport		
Fascinatingly although mainstream Misratan militias have joined the fray, the Zintani brigades most notably Sawaiq, Qa’aqa’a, and Madani maintain control of the airport.  According to an article from CNN by Jomana Karadsheh, UN officials have not only fled the country but are warning that a dangerous escalation is likely.  Furthermore, it appears that Misratan forces are regrouping for another push on the airport.
Addressing the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, Tarek Mitri, head of its mission in Libya, issued a stark warning.”As the number of military actors mobilizing and consolidating their presence within the capital continues to grow, there is a mounting sense of a probable imminent and significant escalation in the conflict. The stakes are high for all sides,” Mitri said.”We are in the middle of an all-out confrontation between two major rival groups in the Libyan capital. That confrontation, born out of the deep political polarization, is playing itself out at the country’s international airport.” Mitri said.
Libya’s Foreign Minister Mohamed Abdulaziz also addressed the Security Council. He warned of Libya heading toward becoming a “failed state.”Abdulaziz said Libya needed more international support and asked the United Nations to consider a “stabilization and institution-building mission.”
It is quite likely that the anti-Islamist current are pushing for foreign peacekeepers under the guise of trainers, but the international political dimension is not able to move along that line given polarization in Europe post-Crimea annexation.


21Jul2014 			Are The Islamists as Organized as The Media Portrays Them to Be?		
As the conflict for Tripoli International Airport intensifies, Islamists backlash has seen a strong uptick. One individual’s opinion that will carry some weight is the self-proclaimed Grand Mufti of Libya, Sadiq Gherani, who issued a fatwa in support of attack on Tripoli Airport. The leader of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, Bashir Al-Katabi, also emphasized the need to resolve the current political unrest using domestic alternatives, warning that the use of international forces can have some unintended consequences. Al-Katabi also refused to describe the initial results of the new parliament elections as a defeat for the brotherhood, saying that a great majority of the Islamists won as independents in this election. For our arabic readers, you can access more information about Al-Katabi in this interview. For our english readers, the article can be translated using the Google Chrome browser.
These developments, along with the clashes taking place at Tripoli International Airport, show that the Islamists may not be as organized as the media portrays them to be. On the one hand, you have a very diplomatic formal leadership that recognizes the need to respect the ballot box and to work within the state institutions. On the other hand, there are factions within the Islamists who prefer to use violence and threats. Libyan analyst and commentator, Senussi Bsaikri, said he was contacted by the Libyan Revolutionaries Operations Room, a militia backing the GNC, and asked to put pressure on Libya‘s Muslim Brotherhood to lobby for one candidate for prime minister over another. “They said if the Justice and Construction Party continues to stand in front of us, we will attack them and kidnap their members,” said Bsaikri. More information related to the LROR is available in this Financial Times article. 
Despite indications from the preliminary ballot results that the Nationalist forces are far more popular, the Islamists will simply not give up in their struggle for power. They have the weapons, vehicles and religious zeal to defend the country against its perceived enemies. These forces include what they describe as drug dealers, human traffickers or liberal politicians they view as having been loyal to Qaddafi.



17Jul2014 			Islamist-Nationalist Rift Intensifies as Another Prominent Female Activist is Assassinated and Airport Workers Strike		
In another sign of growing turmoil, air controllers halted work in Tripoli, shutting off much of Western Libya from international traffic. On Wednesday, Libya reopened the western Misrata airport, which had been closed with Tripoli after the weekend attack. However, the Misrata Airport will have to be shut again because Tripoli air controllers are also responsible for Misrata. Also, gunmen shot dead Fariha al-Barkawi, a former member of parliament, in the Eastern City of Derna. She is the second prominent woman to be assassinated, following the killing of Benghazi human rights activist Salwa Bugaighis last month.
The strike is designed by the workers to put pressure on rival militias to end four days of heavy fighting over control of the country’s biggest airport. Since the airport violence was instigated by the Libya Shield militia, a Misratan-based militia, this tactic is designed to eliminate any possible incentives Misratan forces may have to destroy the Tripoli Airport for the purpose of luring in more international flight business into Misrata. In the case of Fariha Al-Barkawi, one can see that the rift between Islamist and  Nationalist forces is only growing as Rogue General Khalifa Haftar attempts to rid Cyrenaica of the various Islamist factions.
It will be interesting to see what becomes of the Islamist-influenced factions as the official results of the Parliamentary Elections. Outside of Misrauta, Souq-Al Jouma and parts of Cyrenaica, these factions are relying on military force and violence to have their voice heard in the country. One would suspect, at this point, that the Islamists will not honour the election results on the basis of the relatively low turnout.


15Jul2014 			Damage to the Airport and Aircrafts Are a Big Blow to a Weakened Business Sector		
According to government spokesman Ahmed Lamine, 90% of the planes at Libya’s Tripoli International Airport have been destroyed after shelling attacks on the site by rival militias. “The government has studied the possibility to bring international forces to enhance security,” he told reporters, according to Reuters news agency. It was not immediately clear how many planes were destroyed, but the airport serves as the main hub for several Libyan carriers. Very little shocks Libyans these days, but the latest attack on this vital asset has left many at a loss for words. They didn’t think militia would ever go this far.
The closure of Tripoli airport is hugely significant both for the business sector and for access to Libya from the outside world. In 2012, Tripoli International Airport accounted for around 57% of the 4.9 million domestic and international passengers who used Libyan airports, with Benghazi’s Benina airport (now also closed due to damage) in second place and Misrata third. Some of the immediate implications are likely to be heavy traffic at the Ras Jedir border crossing with Tunisia, which is now effectively the only access point to western Libya, and busier flights from Tunisia to Europe. The true scale of the damage inflicted on the airport is unclear, but a closure of at least several weeks – and potentially much longer – seems unavoidable.
It will be interesting to see if the Libyan government will indeed follow through on its threat of bringing foreign security forces into the country. Although the civilian population would welcome any political solution that weakens the militias, the militias will certainly not allow the government to take its power easily.


15Jul2014 			Is Tripoli Witnessing A Civil War between Misrata and Zintan or is this a minor clash between rogue brigades?		
Tripoli is bracing itself for a major showdown between the capital’s major factions  as the long anticipated fight between the Misratans and Zintanis based in Tripoli may finally have begun. It is noteworthy to point out that brigade commanders are battling it out — not as the media represents, the Zintani and Misratan political leadership who apparently do not endorse the fighting and are seeking to end it. Jomana Karadsheh and Ashley Fantz speak in great detail about the clashes that took place in this CNN article.
Fighting has already erupted in the capital with certain rogue Misratan brigades trying to force the Zintanis out of Tripoli International Airport in the name of ‘securing the capital’. Various Islamist brigades from Tripoli and further afield have lined up behind the activist Misratan units in a bid to oust the Zintani forces and it looks as though the Zintanis are about to get back up from other non-Islamist brigades, including the Warshefana.
The situation is extremely tense and local residents are fearing the worst. Ironically, this outbreak of fighting was only initiated after the betrayal of an agreement struck on the night of the July 12 which was meant to facilitate the impasse. At the July 12 meeting the major respected political actors of Misrata and Zintan pledged themselves to avoiding conflict.  It appears that a former militia leader and Misratan congressmen, led the offensive against the Zintani militias in a bid to retake the airport directly– overtly disobeying orders from other top Misratans.


14Jul2014 			Despite Strikes in Brega, Ras Lanuf and Sidra Set to Open		
In an interesting piece, Maher Chmaytelli shows that strikes in Brega will not disrupt the deal with Jathran relative to Ras Lanuf and Sidra in this Bloomberg article . It also seems that Libya has restored output to roughly 500,000 barrels a day on the El-Sahara. However, no one knows how long that will last given the current tensions in Tripoli and possible spillover effects.


04Jul2014 			Jadhran Hands over Port and Signs of Grand Bargain Emerging		
Libya has given a few reasons to be hopeful over the past week.  This has been underappreciated. Certainly, Alison Pargeter was spot on to point out the persistence of militia dominance on the ground and the dysfunctionality of central institutions in a brilliant AJE article today.  But a lot is moving and shaking and On July 2nd, Libya’s biggest Cyrenaican oil ports — Ras Lanuf and Al-Sidra (Essider) with over a capacity of 500,000 barrels a day– were handed over by the federalists to the government and are in the process of becoming ready to receive tankers. Previous attempted bargains with Jadhran fell through or were never implemented because Islamist actors in the GNC and ministries undermined them assuming they could attempt to dominate Jadhran militarily and gain dominance over the oil sector for themselves.
What has happened is that Jadhran’s federalists have essentially stated their intention to finally honour the second part of an April agreement with outgoing prime minister Abdullah al-Thinni to open the ports under their control (the first part related to Zuweitina and Hariga), culminating in their miraculously handing over Ras Lanuf and al-Sidra to the government on Wednesday. It is unclear exactly what the government is offering to Jadhran in return but this should soon become clear as Jadhran begins to assume a new position in the national political scene. This dramatic but not unpredictable development could act as a precursor to further various locally-brokered arrangements to finally truly end the political and economic stalemates of the GNC period. It shows that Jadhran is calculating that the House of Representatives will be far less Islamist-dominated than the GNC was, and that if a grand bargain / unity government is going to occur he would like to be included/have his share of the spoils.  Read my take on the big picture dimension of this all in the Middle East Eye by clicking here.
