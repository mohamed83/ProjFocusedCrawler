It pledged 13.7 million euros, or about $15.6 million, to assist with unaccompanied minors and €18 million to extend Triton, Europe's border control operation in the Mediterranean.”We cannot replace Italy in the management of the external borders, but we can lend a helping hand,” said the European Union's migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos. “Italy is not alone. Europe stands with Italy.”Triton, which is responsible for patrolling the Continent’s shores and, in emergencies, rescuing people in distress, was supposed to last for only a few months as a replacement for Mare Nostrum, the Italian Navy-led search-and-rescue mission. European authorities decided on Thursday to fund Triton until “at least the end of 2015.” They did not clarify whether the patrols would start traveling farther out in the Mediterranean.Critics have warned that as long as Triton remained limited to 30 nautical miles off the coast, more shipwrecks were bound to occur as the rubber boats that traffickers of migrants increasingly use for sea crossings encounter difficulties as far away as 100 nautical miles south of Italy.Related CoverageRescued African Migrants Recount Ordeal in Mediterranean  Feb 11, 2015ShareSaveShow Full Article                            xSharexEmailTwitterWhatsappGoogleRedditLinkedInPermalinkhttp://nyti.ms/1zqNmcoToolsSaveMore In WorldISIS Fighters Seize Control of Syrian City of Palmyra, and Ancient RuinsIslamic State militants have already destroyed historical sites and sold off artifacts in other cities, and people fear they may do the same to the famous ruins in Palmyra.U.S. to Send Rockets to Iraq for ISIS Fight9:17 PM ETObama officials have called the fall of Ramadi a huge setback, but have sought to quell critics in the region with the deployment of weapons, which are expected to arrive in early June.Iran’s Supreme Leader Rules Out Broad Nuclear InspectionsAyatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran would not agree to any requirement to allow access to military sites or to its nuclear scientists.Back to topMain MenuHomeHomeWorldU.S.U.S. NewsPoliticsU.S. PoliticsThe UpshotNew YorkBusinessBusinessBusiness DayTechnologySportsSportsOpinionOpinionScienceHealthArtsArtsStyleStylePhotosVideoMost EmailedTimes PremierMore SectionsAutomobilesBlogsBooksFoodFoodFoodEducationMagazineMen's StyleMoviesMusicMedia & AdvertisingObituariesPublic EditorReal EstateSunday ReviewGreat Homes and DestinationsT MagazineTelevisionTheaterTimes WireTravelWeddingsWomen in the WorldCorrectionsRecommendationsSavedSettingsEdition:Type Size:AAANight Mode:Account:SubscribeLog inDownload Our AppsNYTimesNYT NowNYT Real EstateCrosswordDownload the NYTimes appHelpSubscribeFeedbackTerms of ServicePrivacy© 2015 The New York Times Company
