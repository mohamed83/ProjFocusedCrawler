26Jun2014 			The House of Representatives Election		
Well the election played out pretty much as expected, with the media coverage of it about as lacklustre as the election itself.  Low turnout, but not so bad among registered voters; reporters misunderstood the electoral process;  Sporadic violence and one high profile assassination of an inspiring female Libyan human rights activist politician in Benghazi. (Read more on this from AJE here.)  This is par for the course given where Libya is at right now.  It does seem that many Libyans who voted were motivated to do so by their antipathy for the Brotherhood and Islamist.  For more on that read from the NYT here. Tarek Mitri, head of UNSMIL congratulated the HNEC on a well run election, which means as we know that Libyan elections are not bought or stolen at the ballot box which is one of the refreshing aspects about post-Qadhafi politics.  For more on the UN dimension click here.  Well to sum up, the election does seem to have legitimized Hiftar’s movement to some extent and to have re-invigorated the transition process, but also to have highlighted that Benghazi, Darna, Sabha, and elsewhere are motivated entirely by their own local militia dynamics and civic conflicts and that the election or the policies of electoral governance cannot really transcend those dynamics.  Such seems to be how things go in an increasingly localized and perpherially-dominated Libya.


25Jun2014 			Election Day Guide		
Middle East Eye — an online news source — has established itself as a dynamic and up-and-coming player in the English language in depth coverage of the Middle East.  There treatment is serious and their articles tend to rely on a lot of expert analysis and quotes.  Here is what they and I have to say about today’s Libyan election.
Most agree that uncertainty lies ahead, no matter which way the vote ends up swinging. “Even people on the ground have no idea what the results will be. There is not enough information,” says Jason Pack, researcher of Libyan history at Cambridge University and President of Libya-Analysis.com. “But it is likely to be a repeat of what we have seen – a large crop of independents with leanings toward the Brotherhood. However, it does appear that the groupings will be less Islamist-leaning because of the frustration of the Islamist takeover of the GNC.” 
But while it may be too early to give up hope that the election will prove to be a positive turning point, cracks have already appeared in Libya’s electoral fabric, and Libya continues to have a host of internal and external factors working against it. “The desire to not have political parties participate means that we are going to see a repeat of the deadlock at the GNC, which will mean it will be almost impossible to get a consensus, no matter who is going to be elected,” says Pack.
“Haftar remains unpopular, but his enemies are even less popular,” says Pack. “Libyan politics at the moment are conceived as a zero sum game between two or three larger factions. Until those factions are ready to negotiate behind the scenes and come to a grand bargain, it is not possible for there to be any unifying figures.”
However, if a grand bargain is somehow struck behind the scenes, the new House of Representatives may finally find itself empowered and acting at long last to reach into local communities and bring unity, explains Pack.  “If that miraculously happens, the elections will be a great success, and it won’t have mattered that turnout was low,” he says. “If the body is empowered to act in a legitimate fashion, that will be amazing.” 


24Jun2014 			Mary Fitzgerald’s Interview with Hiftar		
One would hope she would have said more, but it is quite impressive that she got the interview and noted that Hiftar has the same megalomania combined with extreme sensitivity to being slighted that Qahdafi exhibited. To read her article in the Guardian click here. 


23Jun2014 			Turks and Qataris Ordered to Leave Eastern Libya		
Although this is a PR move by Haftar it points out the extend to which Ansar al-Sharia can only expand and grow on Qatari funding and some outside expertise and that the various militias are fighting as a proxy conflict between Turkey and Qatari on the Misrata/Islamist side and Egypt/UAE/Saudi/and the West on the Zintani/Haftar Side…  Read the article from ABC here.  Also there was a good article about why the USA should be wary of Haftar in today’s INYT by Ibrahim Sharqieh of Brookings...  I 100% agree with the piece and its meta-message about US policy towards hiftar is 100% correct.. I just have an issue about the use of the word civil war… we are not experiencing and are not going to see a civil war in Libya.. using that word ‘civil war’ gets US audiences all up in arms and confused so I think it is risky to refer to what is happening or might happen there as a civil war. But Sharqieh knows his stuff so he no doubt has his reasons.

21Jun2014 			Three Things to Watch for in the Libya Elections		
Some more good common sense from Mattia Toeldo of ECFR.  In this article, he points out how the upcoming June 25 elections can only be a success if a pre-existing political reconciliation happens behind the scenes. On this I couldn’t agree more.
A “reconciliation” meeting between Libya’s opposing coalitions was due to be held on 18 June under the auspices of UNSMIL. However, the meeting had to be indefinitely postponed, because elements close to General Heftar’s anti-Islamist coalition accused the UN of being biased in favour of the Muslim Brotherhood. At the moment, the warring parties have made no commitment to recognise the election results.
Lack of recognition of the results from all sides in the Libyan political sphere could turn out to be a major cause of regret for European policymakers. Holding elections in the current situation, with the country divided between two warring coalitions, is an uncalculated risk. Polls may actually accelerate violence rather than solving Libya’s problems.

12Jun2014 			Libya’s Faustian Bargains: The Hardcopy		
My recent critically acclaimed think-tank report, co-authored with Karim Mezran and Mohamed ElJarh, "Libya's Faustian Bargains: Breaking the Appeasement Cycle" is now available for purchase in hardcopy in the UK and US on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk.  You may buy it for $30 plus shipping and handling in the US by clicking here or for 25 GBP with free shipping in the UK or Europe by clicking here.  The report examines the threats to Libya's stability, provides a detailed mapping of the militia landscape, and details policy options for the Libyan government and its international partners.


10Jun2014 			Setting the Record Straight on the US’s role in Libya		
Ethan Chorin has long argued that America and the West were wrong to engage with Qadhafi. Weirdly he somehow believes that American and Western incorrect actions back then have led to Western failures and missteps in post-Qadhafi Libya. For me the issues are rather separate. The Western countries have made many policy missteps in their attempts to support Libya post-Qadhafi but the irony is that these mistakes have not only not been systematic but they have been quite haphazard and grounded in an ability to engage sufficiently.
On May 28, Chorin wrote an op-ed in the NYT which sketched out some of the key dilemmas facing American policymakers relative to Hiftar’s movement and in this regard, he and I agree. The US should clarify that it is not and will not support an anti-democratic takeover in Libya that mirrors Sisi’s power-grabbing behaviors in Egypt and would negate and undo the transition process in Libya.  On this Chorin and I are 100% in agreement. And yet, he made a range of very false and counterproductive assertions. Ironically, he did so without even attempting to demonstrate or support his claims.  Therefore, I felt as a matter of principle compelled to set the record straight by writing a letter to the editor of The New York Times.  I think the editors there immediately understood that they had published potential falsehoods and were eager to use my letter to set the record straight. You may read my letter published in the June 9, NYT by clicking here or read my review of Chorin’s book by clicking here.  Also the text of my letter is presented below:

Re “The new danger in Benghazi” (Opinion, May 28): Ethan Chorin correctly warns of the danger of Gen. Khalifa Hiftar’s anti-Islamist paramilitary movement attempting a crude power grab. Mr. Chorin’s counsel to American policy makers to distance themselves from General Hiftar while reiterating their support for Libya’s derailed formal transition process is a wise one.
Yet where Mr. Chorin errs is to write that “America has gotten into trouble in Libya by not taking clear positions. During the 2003 rapprochement, we told Colonel Qaddafi we had conditions for reconciling with him. Then we didn’t enforce them.” This is the same sort of analysis Mr. Chorin puts forth in his book, “Exit the Colonel: The Hidden History of the Libyan Revolution,” in which he claims that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi outfoxed the West, which engaged in Libya out of greed.
Mr. Chorin’s conspiratorial analysis is sexy, but plays rather loose with the facts. The United States enforced the terms of the 2003 bargain with Colonel Qaddafi as much as it could. Moreover, the American foreign policy establishment and business community never fully embraced Colonel Qaddafi. It was their calculated engagement with the dictator that opened Libya up for a modicum of economic development, globalization, and eventually a revolution aimed at freeing the Libyan people.
The writer also insinuates that the Islamist takeover in Benghazi was due to American actions and inactions. In reality, it was due to the Libyan General National Congress’s policy of appeasing the militias. Getting the facts of this history right is essential. The facts highlight that Libya’s destiny is decided by Libyans and that the West must engage in a supporting role with whatever legitimate government is in place (no matter how flawed or weak) and seek to help the Libyan people fulfill their aspirations to be full-fledged members of the international community.

10Jun2014 			Maiteg Accepts Supreme Court Decision and Resigns		
In a rare encouraging development, the rule of law has been acknowledged as supreme and the institutions of the Libyan state as legitimate arbiters of power and due process.  You can read more about this amazing development from AJE, or Libya Herald, or The Economist.  My take on the upshot is:
After the  Libyan Supreme Court ruled on Monday June 9 that Ahmed Maiteg’s appointment as prime minister was unconstitutional, he said he would step down immediately and not contest the Supreme Court ruling in the interest of the “rule of law.”  Maiteg’s decision to step down is an impressive and rare demonstration of the respect for the rule of law. Furthermore, Thinni’s continuity as prime minister increases the chances that Ibrahim Jadhran and the Petroleum Facilities Guards will respect negotiated deals to open ports and oilfields in the east. This is, in fact, one if its key implications and it is possible that Maiteg’s decision reveals that a backdoor ‘grand bargain’ is in the works between the federalists, moderate Islamists and Misratans, and the anti-Islamists, Haftar and the Zintanis.  This potentiality of a grand bargain could see the security situation improve as political consensus is increasingly manufactured. Well at least there is something new to hope for and it will be interesting to see if new signs of a grand bargain materialize over the next days.


03Jun2014 			Maetig Seizes Prime Ministry Building		
After having the Libya Shield force help him occupy the PM’s office, pseudo-Prime Minister Ahmed Matiq held his first cabinet meeting on June 2, escalating the confrontation between him and Abdullah Thinni over who has legitimate claim to the Prime Ministerial office. You can read more from the Libya Herald here. 
Despite a new vote in Matiq’s favour, Thinni has refused to recognize the transfer of his power to Maiteeg until the GNC clarifies the vote in a procedurally sound way, despite an opinion from the GNC’s Legislative and Constitutional Committee that the vote was valid. Maiteeg’s cabinet met in the prime minister’s office on June 2, and Thinni has reportedly move to another government building.
The conflict between the two prime ministers weakens the government’s ability to respond to the ongoing militia fighting instigated by General Khalifa Hafter, whose “Operation Dignity” has pledged to rid the country of “Islamist militias.” Hafter is conducting the operation without authorization from the government or the GNC. The conflict escalated over the weekend with aerial bombings against suspected Islamist strongholds in Benghazi.  What we are seeing is the logical conclusion of the increasing polarization between Islamist and anti-Islamist militias, local councils, and national political actors.  I sketched this conflict and provide the essential background for it in a think tank report I cowrote with Karim Mezran and Mohamed ElJarh for the Atlantic Council.  It is now available for purchase in hard copy by clicking here. It makes the essential reference work for any policy maker, consultant, or academic trying to make sense of militia/government relations as we present a comprehensive militia map as well as lay out the policies that both the Libyan and Western governments need to adopt to prevent the collapse of the transition process. The first step is to achieve a grand bargain between the major interested factions, the second step is to restart the transition process under clearly defined rules of the game.
Elections for a House of Representatives to replace the GNC have been called for June. But the violence, and the triangular conflict between the GNC, Maiteeg, and Thinni, might make polling impossible. Matig’s arrogation of  power of  the past days appears that a compromise between the two claimant PMs is unlikely.
