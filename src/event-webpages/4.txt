Italian prosecutors say a survivor of the migrant boat capsizing in the Mediterranean has told them 950 people were aboard, including hundreds who were locked in the hold by smugglers.Catania Prosecutor Giovanni Salvi told The Associated Press by phone from that Sicilian city that the survivor, a man from Bangladesh, gave the information to prosecutors who interviewed him at the Catania hospital where he was flown by an Italian navy helicopter.Earlier, authorities said a survivor told them that 700 people were aboard the boat, which capsized off Libya's coast on its way to Europe. It wasn't immediately clear if it was the same survivor who gave two different figures, or if the two figures came from two different survivors. The official death toll is 24, with 28 people rescued.Salvi stressed that there was no confirmation yet of the man's account and that the investigation was ongoing. The man told investigators about 300 people were in the hold when the fishing boat overturned. The survivor said about 200 women and dozens of children were among the passengers.Gen. Antonino Iraso, of the Italian Border Police which has deployed boats in the rescue operation, seemed to back the survivor's account since so few bodies were found in the area where boat capsized. If so many people were locked in the hold, he told Sky TG24 TV, "surely the boat would have sunk." He said the depths of the sea there are too deep for divers.
