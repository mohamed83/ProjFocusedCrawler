24Feb2014 			Constitutional Committee Election Final Turnout Put at Half Million		
Well, among those who registered turnout was not so low.  Very interesting is how the re-runs will go in Ubari and elsewhere and most importantly if the minorities will be brought on board via some outside negotiations or appeasement tactics.  Read more from the LH here.
Releasing the full figures for the turnout in Thursday’s Constitutional Committee elections last night, the Higher National Elections Commission (HNEC) has reiterated that an attempt to re-run the contest will take place on Wednesday in those polling centres where violence or blockades prevented it happening.  If, however, they are disrupted again, the issue will have to be resolved by the General National Congress, HNEC head Nuri Elabbar said.
He said that negotiations  with the Amazigh community which boycotted the elections were still at an impasse.  However, there were a number of suggestions that had been made to break the deadlock, among them the appointment of Amazigh representatives to the two uncontested Amazigh seats in Zuwara and the Jebel Nafusa.
It has been suggested that the Supreme Amazigh Council be empowered by Congress to appoint them – a move that would, for the first time, give the council official status in Libya.


22Feb2014 			45 Percent Turnout in Constitutional Committee Elections but 13 Seats Cannot be Declared		
The biggest blight on the CA elections was the led up to them and not the actually conduct of them.  The Amazigh boycott and pure information and campaigning are really what made it impossible for these elections to succeed.  Yet, by hook or by crook, the HNEC needs to forge ahead and find away to appoint candidates for the 13 Seats where it was unable to open the polls on Feb 20.  Read the key article from Libya Herald here.
The turnout in yesterday’s elections for the Constitutional Committee elections was 45 percent, the Higher National Elections Commission (HNEC) has said. But because of violence, disruptions and boycotts, 13 seats cannot be filled as yet.
A total of 497,663 of the 1.1 million people who registered to vote had done so, HNEC chairman Nuri Elabbar said at a press conference late last night. However, reports from twenty-nine centres in five Electoral regions were still awaited.
The 45-percent turnout, although lower than hoped for, is seen as more than sufficient to avoid accusations that the Constitutional Committee has no legitimacy. However, the appointment of if not all the 13 seats, certainly almost all, is another matter.


21Feb2014 			Too Cool for a Coup, Part Two		
Following the 14 February statement by Maj. General Khalifa Hiftar calling for the GNC and cabinet to dissolve and sounding suspiciously like the start to a military coup attempt, the Qaaqaa Brigade and Sawaiq Brigade of Zintan origin issued an ultimatum to the GNC on 18 February to disband within five hours of the statement – or else GNC members would be arrested. The Libya Herald reports, however, that Qaaqaa Brigade members were not seen in the city that night, militia forces did not move from Zintan into Tripoli, nor did the threatened arrests take place.
Each subsequent attempt has emboldened others to try their hand, or to strike out against rivals lest they make a bid for power. Now with conflicting reports out that Qaaqaa Brigade leader Othman Mlaiqitah was wounded in what was possibly an assassination attempt (or a car crash), those who would seek to take hold of the reins of power had best be prepared to weather their own armed opposition.
These possible coup attempts were not enough to further derail the 20 February elections for Libya’s constituent assembly, already suffering from boycott by the Amazigh, polling station violence in Derna and Ubari, and general voter apathy. Preliminary results from Eastern Libya are indicating a possible win for the federalist current, as well as a possible seat for former NTC Finance and Oil Minister Ali Tarhouni according to the Alwasat.ly news website. However, The High National Election Commission has not yet announced any such results on its website http://hnec.ly.


21Feb2014 			New Alignments between Zintan, GNC, Islamists and the Population		
Voting has just ended in Libya on Feb 20 and the good news is that the elections actually happened.  The bad news is that formal institutions are being entirely sidelined by informal politics, ultimatums, conspiracies, and popular upheavals. Things are rapidly shifting in Libya and not being on the ground it is very difficult to keep up with all that is going on.  Rather than trying to analyze what I do not yet have a grasp on, I will suggest the following articles on the recent events and the Constituent Assembly Elections:  Mansour el-Kikhia in AJE on the new politics about forcing the dissolution of the GNC and Ulf Laessing of Reuters on the events of the constitutional committee elections.


16Feb2014 			To Coup, Or Not to Coup?		
The brief October 2013 kidnapping of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan demonstrated that coup attempts are possible, but it is unlikely that any faction in Libya would be able at this stage to garner enough support to hold power. Furthermore, the shadow of the years following Muammar Qadhafi’s own military coup in 1969 still looms over Libya, and current military leadership has not inspired public confidence, making a coup by military members especially difficult.
Following in the footsteps of those in recent months who have made sweeping political declarations without the authority to do so, retired Maj. General Khalifa Hiftar formerly of the Libyan army announced just six days before the elections for the sixty person committee to draft a new Libyan constitution that the military would be taking over, the GNC would be dissolved, and a new political roadmap would be devised.
However, after all of Hiftar’s inflammatory words, absolutely nothing happened. According to the New York Times,
“Then, nothing happened. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan called the supposed coup “ridiculous.” A military spokesman called it “a lie.” None of the Libyan Army’s few tanks or soldiers made any visible moves. The empty Parliament was quiet.”
More on the story is available from the New York Times here: “In Libya, a Coup. Or Perhaps Not.”


13Feb2014 			Jadhran’s Brother to Be Returned to Libya after Arrest in UAE		
Big news.  Jadhran’s brother was caught trying to make a deal for Cyrenaica’s oil in Dubai.  That the UAE caught him is a great sign as it means that the international actors are helping out Libya’s central authorities even when they might have a financial interest to not do so!  This is very good. You can read about it from the Libya Herald here.
Khaled Jadhran, one of the brothers of Cyrenaican break-away leader Ibrahim Jadhran, is awaiting extradition to Libya following his arrest in Dubai on charges of trying to illegally sell Libyan oil.
A close family member denied the charges against Khaled, saying: “He wasn’t involved in anything to do with Cyranaica, he is a businessman.” The relative added that he had been released on bail, which he claimed had been paid by a member of Dubai’s ruling family.  “He is now free in Dubai, but his passport was taken,” he said. “Khaled has a travel document allowing him to make one journey and is now waiting for the Libyan prosecutors to report to the Dubai authorities about the charges.”


13Feb2014 			Libya vs Western Bankers		
Libya vs. Goldman Round 1 an op-ed for The Majalla by Jason Pack
During the rush after Gaddafi’s détente with the US in 2003, the LIA was courted by successive Western companies and invested in assets as diverse as the Dutch–Belgian bank Fortis and the Italian football club Juventus. Previous reports and court documents paint a picture of an inexperienced management team at the LIA wowed by sophisticated Western financiers. This, however, is a vast oversimplification.
The LIA now claims the deal was clouded by opaque structures and misleading advice. This, however, seems unlikely to be the full explanation despite how convenient it would be for the post-Gaddafi Libyan authorities. Given Zarti’s endorsment of other bad trades for the LIA on which he stood to gain personally, it is far more likely that Zarti and those around him were involved in various side actions with Goldman surrounding the losses. However, Zarti and Goldman would have been very careful to avoid leaving any sort of paper trail.
For Libyan politicians, the pending case represents an opportunity for the country’s new leaders to claw back losses incurred during Gaddafi’s reign, as well as to expose the corruption of the former regime and its nefarious and unscrupulous dealings with the Libyan people’s money.


12Feb2014 			Correcting the Course of Libya’s Revolution (Part 1/2)		
Here is a very interesting (and fairly long) article putting forth an explanation of why Libya’s transitional arrangements have come unstuck. He suggest the innovative but impracticable solution for the Constituent Assembly to take over the GNC’s governance responsibilities.  This isn’t something I would support, because it would tip the balance too much towards Fezzan and Cyrenaica, but Megirisi is right that something needs to be done to change the structures and timelines. Read the whole thing here.
Thus, being the center of Libya’s political system, the GNC — a 200-member parliament filled through the country’s first fair, if not confused, national elections — naturally became the point of projection for Libya’s regional and ideological groups to take their cause national.
This resurrection of the old mindset rendered the new system unable to solve problems it encountered, as factions fought to glorify their own solutions rather than enact a cooperative system. Consequently, it created the popular perception that GNC members are the nation’s decisive power-holders.
This inaction of the official political process forced pressure groups into more coercive forms of lobbying. As the authorities continuously wilted under confrontation, these groups grew more emboldened, advancing from threats to invading institutions, acts of violence, and even withholding key utilities from the capital in order to extort their demands.
Moreover, the entrenchment of opportunistically criminal actors throughout Libya has rendered a powerful shadow force and network of incentives. They are working to prevent the emergence of any systems of security, accountability or transparency, which would dissolve their power base, newly secured privileges, and possibly end in their criminal prosecution.
As the Constitutional Assembly elections at the end of February draw closer, many have started to call for the CA to take on the role of the GNC and to draft the constitution. Although this is a popular idea, a lot of groundwork would need to be done to make it feasible……


11Feb2014 			Even Federalism Won’t Placate the Federalists		
Yemen has just announced that it will operate as a Federalist state for the first time in its history.  And surprise, surprise, the Southern Yemeni Federalists are still protesting.  Yemen has a culture of centre and periphery similar to that in Libya so I wouldn’t be surprised at all, if Cyrenaican Federalists would not accept what ever moderate federalism and decentralization that they get in the constitution and seek to gain more through force even after they have already achieved their aims.
Saba said a federal state comprised of six regions garnered the “highest level of agreement” against another proposal to divide the country into two regions, one in the north and one in the south. Southern Yemeni leaders rejected the accord. “What has been announced about the six regions is a coup against what had been agreed at the dialogue,” said Mohammed Ali Ahmed, a former South Yemen interior minister who returned from exile in March 2012. “That is why I pulled out of the dialogue,” he told Reuters.
Some southerners fear that having several regions would dilute their authority and deprive them of control over important areas such as Hadramout, where some of Yemen’s oil reserves are found.
Nasser al-Nawba, a founder of the southern Hirak separatist movement, also rejected the deal, saying the only solution was for the north and south to each have their own state, as was the case before 1990.


11Feb2014 			Zeidan’s Newly Proposed Cabinet has Been Rejected		
Below is the full text of an article from the Libya Business News
A cabinet reshuffle proposed by Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has been rejected on Sunday by Libya’s General National Congress (GNC).
MP Mahmoud al-Gheriani told Anadolu Agency that parliament turned down the request,“given an earlier agreement to withdraw confidence from the government in mid-February“.
 
Libya Herald reported that the proposed new ministers were:

Mahmoud Ajaj, current head of HIB, to replace Ali Hussein Al-Sharif at Housing and Utilities;
Mraja Gaith, current Deputy Minister of Finance, at Finance (replacing Alkilani Abdel-Kareem);
Mohamed Muftah Nuh, currently head of the PIB Western Region, at Economy (replacing Mustafa Abofanas);
Fathi Mohamed Abdul-Latif at Oil and Gas (replacing Abdulbari Al-Arusi);
Saleh Mazen Abdurrahman Barasi, current head of Tripoli CID, at Interior, currently being run by the Deputy Prime Minister Sadiq Abdulkarim;
Ibrahim Sharkas as Youth and Sports Minister to replace Abdulsalam Guaila;
Mohamed Bashir Abduldaim as Local Government Minister, replacing Abubakr Al-Hadi Mohammed; and,
Minister Habib Al-Amin is taking on the Information Ministry.




09Feb2014 			Dunks and Dodging Bullets: Americans Chase Hoop Dreams in Libya		
Here is a little bit of ‘light’ Libya reading from NBC News, showing how the American media still likes to condense complex multi-dimensional political and social issues, into one dimensional human interest stories with references to violence and sport thrown in.
Earning salaries of up to $8,000 per month and living in mansions and top hotels, a handful of Americans are chasing their hoop dreams in lawless Libya – with the threat of heavily armed Islamist militias and kidnappings providing a constant reminder of just how far they are from home.   ”I lived the first 13 years of my life in some of America’s worst neighborhoods, so it’s similar. But I don’t have my family and I don’t have a gun.”
“I live to play the game,” the 28-year-old point guard told NBC News. “Most people think the revolution is still going on but it’s a very safe place. I haven’t had any problems.” However, security is an issue when it comes to games. As a result, Rice’s team often plays in front of just 30 or 40 people who are vetted and searched.
In Benghazi, where two American pros were reportedly detained by Libyan special forces earlier this month, the situation is a lot more unstable, according to another player who asked not to be named due to security concerns.  ”It’s a lot more dangerous than I expected,” the player said about the city where a 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. “While the club looks after me and they have put me up in a nice place, I can hear the guns and explosions close by and it’s scary.”



08Feb2014 			Protests Against the Extention of the GNC’s Mandate Passed Peacefully		
This is a modicum of good news.  Read the Libya Herald article here.
Despite months of planning and weeks of security concerns, yesterday’s protests against the extension of the General National Congress(GNC) beyond 7 February passed without incident, attracting far fewer protesters than anticipated.
Some two thousand people gathered in Tripoli and several hundred in Benghazi yesterday, with still smaller demonstrations reported in other towns, including Shahat, Beida, Tobruk and Ajdabiya. Amidst much flag-waving and chanting, protestors carried brooms and dustbin bags, calling for a clean-up of Congress. “Martyrs, martyrs, for you, Libya,” a group in Tripoli’s Martyrs’ Square chanted. “Yes to Libya, no to armed groups,” another chanted, referring to the belief held by some that the GNC is heavily-influenced by militias.Independent Benghazi Congressman, Mohamed Busidra, told this paper, however, that the media had exaggerated the public’s desire to see the dissolution of the GNC. “I think personally that everything happening now is due to the political isolation law and Mahmoud Jibril, the head of the National Forces Alliances (NFA),” Busidra said.

06Feb2014 			The Feb 7 Extension of GNC issue		
There is little English language coverage of this important issue, but AFP explains it as follows:
The congress has adopted a new roadmap and timetable, which allow for two scenarios. A general election is to be held at the end of the year if the constitutional body adopts a new charter within four months of its own election set for 20 February. But if the commission deems itself with 60 days incapable of completing the job, a Plan B allows for it to call for immediate presidential and legislative polls for a fresh period of 18 months.
While Karim Mezran of the Atlantic Council writes in his blog post entitled Deepening Polarization in Libya, No Agreement in Sight:
An emerging and worrying trend of political blocs within the General National Congress (GNC) forming alliances with certain militia groups—creating new and divisive power centers—threatens to derail the transition as these power centers prioritize self-interest over the collective good. The injection of weapons onto the political scene not only hampers substantive efforts to build a new Libyan state, but also emboldens criminal elements and political factions with parochial interests.
Efforts to broker an agreement that would create an opening for nascent institutions overcome this stumbling block have now collapsed.  The goal was to have every GNC member sign a pledge upholding these principles. It appears that the two major political blocs—the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Justice and Construction Party and Mahmoud Jibril’s National Forces Alliance (NFA)—agreed. Given the fragmented, multi-polarity that characterizes Libyan politics today, however, the proposed solution collapsed after its rejection by, most notably, the al-Wafa Islamist bloc led by Abdulwahab al-Qaid.
Zintanis militias, which have so far reluctantly stood by the government, already pledged to side with the people if it takes an aggressive stance against the GNC. Meanwhile, Misratan militias, who withdrew from the capital amid widespread condemnation following the fatal clashes in Ghargour in November 2013, have promised to return to Tripoli if need be to defend the legislature and the revolution. Out of public view, Prime Minister Ali Zidan manipulates the factions gripping the legislature to maintain a hold on power, despite growing pressure from external forces urging a “no confidence” vote to oust his administration.
And the bottom line is in Mezran’s words ‘The legislature is banking on the fact that the constitutional committee cannot admit weakness, leaving the legislature in power for several more months.’  It is impossible to know the motivations, but if this exists as the widespread view that is quite damaging for the legislatures already woeful credibility.  One truly cannot predict if or when there will be an outpouring of public support for a mass upheaval to sweep away the current system.
 


05Feb2014 			Libya PM Threatens Eastern Protesters with Troops		
I’m always skeptical when I read a headline like this and sometimes, the subsequent article just makes me cringe with its gullibility.  This time however, Reuters’ Ghaith Shennib adds a little bit of nuance, he knows full well that troops are not going to be deployed against Jadhran and Co. if some ultimatum is overstepped and he lets the reader draw that conclusion. It would be better if the issue was analyzed more directly, but such is nature of journalism these days.  You can read the whole thing by clicking here or my selections below.
Zeidan has repeatedly warned he may use force to free up three key ports where protesters demanding more autonomy from Tripoli have cut off around 600,000 barrels per day of oil exports since summer. Negotiations have gone nowhere with the eastern federalists who have set up their own self-styled Cyrenaica government. But local eastern tribal leaders and officials say support is waning for Jathran within the federalist movement. An attempt to load a tanker at Es Sider port ended abruptly when the navy opened fire, making clear how difficult it would be for Jathran to sell oil independently of Tripoli. But with Libya’s nascent army still in training, most analysts say it will also be difficult for Zeidan to send troops to free up the ports, where Jathran has dug in with his own militia.


01Feb2014 			Is Jadhran’s Support Waning?		
Reuters has published a boldly titled article:  “Support crumbles in east Libya for oil blockade leader”. On the one hand, I’m quite eager for news of the Cyrenaican tribes turning against Jadhran so that the oil can get flowing and the Libyan economy and constitutional process can get back on track.  Yet given developments up and till now, I am of course skeptical that things are moving in that direction.  So you can read the whole article here to judge by yourself. Or glance at some of the key paragraphs I put below.
Even Jathran’s own tribe and leaders in its hometown speak angrily about getting exports flowing again as capital Tripoli warns it may no longer be able to pay public salaries because the blockade has slashed oil revenues. Surveying the potholed roads and abandoned buildings of Ajdabiya, mayor Salem Abdullah is all for fighting for more autonomy and oil wealth from the central government – but not for the blockade. “We are opposed the closure of the oil ports,” he told Reuters. “This has had a very, very negative impact.”
“The right way for us to have been represented would be by elections,” Abdullah said, slamming his right hand on the office desk in frustration. “If you want to represent by force you cannot talk in name of the people.”   Jathran’s al-Magharba tribe is pressuring him to withdraw his men to free up at least 600,000 barrels a day of badly needed oil exports. Several meetings have been held though an attempt to negotiate failed in December. “Sit-ins in front of ports to demand your rights are fine… but shutting down ports is not acceptable. Oil is Libya’s only income and belongs to all Libyans,” said Saleh Atawich, the top Magharba leader.
He has put the strength of his force at more than 20,000 but few in the east believe this, and some oil industry and local estimates put his troop levels at below 5,000….. Jathran says his self-appointed government has formed an oil company to sell crude by bypassing Tripoli’s authority. His group has only appointed a director, and claims to rely otherwise on sympathetic former NOC staff.
