31Jan2014 			Libya: Date Set for Vote to Select Constitutional Panel		
Well, nothing like the Libyan propensity to wait for the 11th hour.  With only twenty days to go the Libyans have finally announced a date for the Constituent Assembly elections.  There has not been enough campaigning or voter registration and it appears that turnout will be far lower than in the GNC elections.  Moreover, no one knows how various armed groups will try to influence the voting process to make sure that the constitutional court is staked with people who will support their regional and local interests.  Read more from Reuters here.


28Jan2014 			Madagascar’s Radio DJ President Jockeys for Power		
Here is my latest in the Huffington Post with Brian Klass about what electoral violence and manipulation in Madagascar have to say about larger issues throughout Africa.
Only amateurs steal elections on election day anymore. Today, the pros manipulate elections long before the voting begins — making sure the playing field is so uneven that election day rigging is unnecessary.
In Africa and around the developing world, election-day rigging is amateur hour. International observers easily detect ballot box stuffing. Other forms of pre-election manipulation, however, remain shrouded in an opportunistic cloud, allowing strongmen to do their dirty work and get away with it.
Let’s be clear: this is not to say that Madagascar’s election was stolen. We don’t know if it was, because there was so little transparency surrounding critical aspects of democratic fairness.  Western governments also need to recognize that elections are a step forward, not a panacea. Madagascar’s election did nothing to change the underlying dynamics that sparked the crisis. Grenade attacks, bleeding protestors, and Putin-esque power grabs make clear that the crisis is not over. International pressure should address the causes of toxic politics, not just the symptoms.
America can help. During President Obama’s tour of Africa last year, he promised that to build global democracy, America is “interested in investing not in strongmen, but in strong institutions.” But until the lessons from Madagascar’s December 20 vote are learned and policies are adapted accordingly, strongmen will win, democratic institutions will lose, and America’s promise will remain empty words.


28Jan2014 			Power Cut Misery to Continue Until Warshefana Clashes Resolved		
Homes across Tripoli will continue to face rolling power cuts until the fighting in Warshefana has ended and security in the area stabilised, the General Electric Company of Libya (GECOL) said today. Read more from the Libya Herald here.


28Jan2014 			Sebha Still Awaiting Military Support		
According to the Libya Herald, “No military reinforcements from the north of the country have yet arrived in Sebha, despite government promises and media reports” since the fighting broke out there in early January.  Read more here.  This is stark indication at how low the government’s willingness and capacity to face down its enemies is.


26Jan2014 			Egyptian Embassy Staff ‘Seized’ in Libya		
In retaliation for Egyptian actions against Shabaan Hadiya a leader of the infamous Revolutionaries Operations Room, there has been a revenge attack in Libya which is the kidnapping of Egyptian embassy officials.  Read about it from BBC here.
Several kidnappings of officials in Libya recently have been blamed on militias. They are often paid by the government, but their allegiance and who controls them remain in doubt.
On Friday a Libyan militia commander was arrested in Egypt. Shabaan Hadiya is the leader of the Revolutionaries’ Operation Room, one of the militias that sprang up during the fight to topple Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.


10Jan2014 			Libya Chaos Worsens		
The Voice of America has published an article with interviews by Karim Mezran and Bill Lawrence entitled “Libya Chaos Worsens”, but haven’t we heard that headline before?  It has some interesting bits which I repeat below.  For the full article click here.
Gripped by months of political turmoil analysts fear the country is edging closer to a possible break-up.  A defiant Zeidan in a bid to head off a vote of no confidence by the country’s parliament, the General National Congress (GNC), told a news conference on Wednesday a vote of no confidence won’t solve the country’s problems.  “I would be happy for a vote of no confidence, but we would not be happy for the government to be left to a caretaker government. I have asked the GNC to choose a Prime Minister. I will not leave the country in an executive vacuum,” Zeidan said.
Karim Mezran, a senior fellow with the Washington DC-based Atlantic Council, says that three-fourths of the GNC are against Zeidan and want him replaced but that the prime minister has managed to block a vote by playing to a minority of lawmakers – preventing a required quorum from being reached.  “Zeidan is clinging to his position no matter what, but what he is doing in effect is to keep Libya stuck,” says Mezran. “Libya is stuck with a government that is not popular and a Congress that has lost its consensus and the situation is the country is close to becoming a failed state.”
“Libya is not one big mess,” says North Africa expert Bill Lawrence, a visiting professor of Political Science and International Affairs at George Washington University. “It is a bunch of little messes that are not very related.  So, the string of assassinations in Benghazi is very different from the political game involved in the militias and their GNC allies in Tripoli, which is different from what’s going on in the borders, which is different from the fighting over smuggling of the trafficking in the South, different from the ethnic conflicts in other communities, and what is happening at the oil facilities. We tend to conflate this all because of the catastrophic weakness of the military and the police.”   Of the challenges facing Libya, the biggest “existential threat” to the country comes from the federalist movement in the East, says Lawrence. “By resisting the demands for federalism because of fears it will result in the break-up of the country, politicians from Western Libya  are in danger of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy whereby their resistance pushes the federalists to become separatists.”


04Jan2014 			Killings of Briton and New Zealander Underscore Libya’s Security Breakdown		
Interviewed for an article for The Guardian, I make the case that the recent killings in Libya are part of the larger situation and that groups that want the central government to fail are clearly taking aim at foreigners.
“I would stick my neck out and say this is some kind of Salafist or jihadist group,” said Jason Pack, a researcher at Cambridge University who runs Libya-analysis.com.  ”The only people who randomly kill foreigners are the jihadists. These extreme tactics are being used by the Islamists at a time the population is turning against them and the government is trying to break free. When they don’t know how to cut a pipeline, killing westerners is an easier way of keeping foreign investors away.”
The prospects of the killers being identified and of security being improved are undermined by the continuing anarchic conditions across post-Gaddafi Libya in which different localities are controlled by communal militias while peace and oil production is only maintained by local deals and pay-offs by the Tripoli government led by prime minister, Ali Zeidan, and the oil companies themselves.  ”This is part of a larger trend of extortion,” Pack said.
“The ‘political’ agenda of these groups is merely a veneer for extortion. The Libyan government finds itself in a conundrum because it has practised appeasement and scrambled to meet the demands of the militias. It has laid down deadlines threatened to use force but has never carried out those threats.”


03Jan2014 			Anna Baldinetti looking for research assistant		
Professor Anna Baldinetti, a good friend of mine and one of the real leaders in the Libya field has asked me to circulate the following announcement to the Middle Eastern Studies community as she is looking for a UK based research assistant.
Here is the announcement
Anna Baldinetti, Professor of History and Political Science at the University of Perugia and former Evans-Pritchard Lecturer at All Souls College, Oxford, is looking for a part-time paid research assistant who is resident in England and has library privileges as a major UK academic library. The successful candidate will be familiar with Arabic and English. Knowledge of Libya and its historiography is a plus, but not required. He or she will be able to help Prof Baldinetti to gather documentation in Arabic on women, family and youth in Libya scattered in various UK libraries (mainly Durham, Oxford, and Soas). The student ( he/she can be based anywhere in the UK) should acquire them by interlibrary loan, make photocopies and send them to me. The pay is 15 euros (about 12 pounds) an hour and of course Prof Baldinetti will refund the interlibrary loans fees as well as other expenses. This is a great opportunity for a young enterprising graduate student working on Libya as it has the potential to develop into further collaboration with Prof Baldinetti. If you are interested please contact anna.baldinetti@unipg.it with your CV.
