28Mar2014 			Crimea as Europe’s Existential Question		
In this article in the NYT, which I co-authored with Professor Brendan Simms, we make the bold (and idealistic) point that the Eurozone countries need to forge a complete Union to deal with the challenges (both economic and political) that they face in the 21st century.  This message inspires me as I believe multilateralism and a greater union of the Western democracies is in fact the only way to deal with the world’s many intractable political questions: from North Africa to Russia to China and elsewhere.  This union of the West should not create antagonism with other powers, but rather help distribute economic gains more fairly and stabilize the transition to a multipolar world. Hope you enjoy the article.
If today’s euro-zone countries do not unite to face the Russian threat, Europe will cease to be a player on the world stage. Mired in debt and divided between a thriving North and underemployed South, Europe’s failure would establish it as a power vacuum — inviting aggression in its borderlands…. Constructing a democratic European superpower in the midst of a crisis won’t be easy, and the dangers of doing so “on the fly” were amply illustrated by Europe’s abysmal performance during the Bosnian crisis of the 1990s, when it required American muscle to deal with a third-rate military threat. The strategic challenge now posed by Russia is far greater, and the failure to confront it will have correspondingly grave consequences.


26Mar2014 			Zeidan Speaks to Christian Amanpour		
Not only was it not his best performance, but the translation was horrible and Amanpour asked the most trite, naive, American-focused questions and managed to mispronounce every Arabic name.  Way to go, CNN!  I would say that this interview reflects increasing polarization between Islamists and non-Islamists in Libya and the international communities inability to arrive at a nuanced appreciation of the complexity of various factions in Libya. Watch the interview by clicking here.


24Mar2014 			ENI Talks Gas with Libya, Shoring Up Non-Russian Supply		
It is a horrible shame that Libyans are not able to benefit from the resource wealth they are sitting on.  It is also a shame that at this moment it would be so damn helpful if they could.  Read more from Reuters.
The head of Eni has met with Libya’s prime minister to discuss the growing importance of Libyan gas to Italy, as the Ukraine crisis highlights Italy’s reliance on supply from Russia…. In a statement on Monday Eni said the key issue discussed in the meeting between Scaroni and Abdallah al-Thinni was the importance of maintaining and increasing Eni’s current production levels in Libya.  ”Following the recent evolutions in the international political scene, Eni’s CEO also underlined the growing importance of Libya to Italy’s gas supply security,” it said.


24Mar2014 			Lars Trabolt vs Vyachslav Pryadkin  in The WC Final — PART 1: Limiting Gammonish Volitility		
In this four part article based on extensive interviews with the players, I will dissect the 25 point final between Lars Trabolt (DEN) and Vyachslav Pryadkin (UKR).  The way the match unfolded, the dice gave Slava the opportunity to decisively steer the match in the direction he wanted and to take Lars out of his game plan and comfort zone.  In fact, all players in the 4-7 PR range should study Pryadkin’s performance; it provides many insights into what match strategies may be successfully employed against the world’s best (if the dice cooperate!).  Bearing this intro in mind, I hope you follow this four part series to be published with Prime Time Magazine over the course of 2014. This first article, will show a range of positions where Lars overcompensated for skill difference choosing to limit gammonish volatility….
Studying the match I found that cube play, unsurprisingly, constitutes the greatest window into a player’s soul, yet surprisingly, opening checker play as well as decisions of when to volunteer shots, hit aggressively, or play purely also provide a fair amount of insight into player psychology/tendencies. This may be the case because in the early game it is impossible to do precise calculations and one must go on gut instinct. Similarly, the issue of volunteering shots or avoiding many blots frequently demonstrates how comfortable the player is with short term tactical risk for potential strategic gain.

20Mar2014 			Libya Leads World in Traffic Deaths Per Capita		
This saddening statistic captures the mood of political and personal recklessness and abandon which prevails in today’s Libya and was nurtured by both the Italians and Qadhafi.  It is interesting to note that two former Italian colonies, Eritrea and Libya, are the two most dangerous places to drive in the World! As Italy had so few colonies this doesn’t seem like a coincidence but rather a causal relationship.  Read the full article here.
It gives Libya a road traffic fatality rate of 60.1 fatalities per 100,000 population (on a population of six million), the highest figure of any country in the world. The next most dangerous place to drive in the world, according to the World Health Organisation, is Eritrea, with a fatality rate of 48.4.
The 2013 rate for Italy is 7.2, France 6.4, Germany 4.4, the UK 2.75 and US 10.4 — meaning that someone is more than eight times more likely to be killed in a traffic accident in Libya than in Italy and 22 times than in the UK….. The soaring rate is attributed by many to young reckless drivers now ignoring traffic regulations in the absence of traffic police to enforce them. However, Libya was already one of the most dangerous places in the world to drive under Qaddafi.  Libya’s rate just before the revolution was 40.5  —  making it at the time the third most dangerous place on earth to drive.
 


17Mar2014 			Iraqi Insurgency Tactics Being Used by Jihadists in Libya		
The anti-American insurgency in Iraq, and to a lesser extent in Afghanistan, was characterized by jihadist militants attempting to prevent the US from training Iraqi and Afghani security forces. This was done by bombing police and army recruitment and training centers. This tactic has just been used in Libya to devastating effect, revealing the extent to which the fight against the central government in Libya is being waged by members of the global jihad who are only capitalizing on the chaotic local conditions.  Read more from Reuters here.
A car bomb exploded outside a Libyan army base in the eastern city of Benghazi on Monday, killing at least five people and wounding others, hospital sources and a security official said.
A hospital official in Benghazi said the five were killed when the bomb exploded as people were leaving a graduation ceremony for officers in the army.


17Mar2014 			Sometimes It Is Tough Being a Pirate		
In an amazingly daring and bold operation, US Navy SEALs have responded to requests from the Libyan and Cypriot authorities, to seize the stateless oil tanker which was commandeered by the Jadhran’s federalist movement and was sailing around the Eastern Mediterranean looking to sell its oil.  This American move demonstrates many things: 1. Obama is a strong leader with a Foreign Policy vision who is willing to exercise force in a targeted manner to uphold the aims of the USA and the international community. 2. The US has not turned its back on Libya.  3. The majority of the Libyan people welcome this kind of international support. And 3. It is quite clear that ‘we’ cannot and will not let the Jadhran style federalists win, now that federalism of this kind is not about administrative decentralization but is actually about Brigandary, piracy, lies, and dysfunctionality.  To read more about what has just transpired here is David Kirkpatrick’s summary for the NYT. 
 United States Navy commandos seized a fugitive oil tanker in the Mediterranean waters southeast of Cyprus on Monday morning, thwarting an attempt by a breakaway Libyan militia to sell its contents on the black market, the Pentagon said. No one was hurt in the operation, the Pentagon said in a statement.
The seizure of the oil, which the United States Navy says it is now returning to Libya, is also a blow to the ambitions of Ibrahim Jathran, the leader of the eastern Libyan militia that sought to sell the oil. Mr. Jathran, who has presented himself as a kind of Libyan Robin Hood, has led an eight-month blockade of Libya’s main oil ports to demand more political autonomy and a bigger cut of the oil revenue for his region, which contains most of the country’s oil reserves.
But in addition to depriving the Libyan government of critical revenue, Mr. Jathran has also irked American and international concerns that have stakes in the Libyan oil industry. The willingness of the United States military to stop illicit exports appears to even out the balance of power between the government in Tripoli and Mr. Jathran’s militia in the east. While Tripoli has been unable to force Mr. Jathran to reopen the ports, he appears unable to sell the oil on his own either, returning the two sides to a stalemate.



13Mar2014 			Consensus Principle and Regional Development Budget Approved by Congress		
Lost in the current upheavals has been this encouraging piece of news reported by Libya Herald:
Tripoli, 12 March 2014:  In a hectic day yesterday, apart from voting to withdraw confidence in Ali Zeidan and discussing elections to replace themselves, the General National Congress (GNC) also agreed to the consensus principle for minority rights and approved a budget for new regional building projects.
GNC member for Obari Tahir Maknni, told the Libya Herald the principle would be defined in full and drafted at a later date. He said however that, now it had been agreed to in theory by Congress, there was no reason why another round of voting to elect representatives from the Tebu and Amazigh communities to the Constitutional Assembly should not go ahead.


12Mar2014 			Libya’s Prime Minister Ousted in Chaos Over Tanker		
It appears the tanker has escaped port, Zeidan order guys to fire but they wouldn’t and maybe Islamists in the army deliberately didn’t fire because they knew that letting Zeidan seem incompetent would bring down his regime and force him out of the country as it has done. The road ahead for Libya now looks very rocky indeed. What is clearly needed is a national unity government.  For a quick overview of how things played out David Kirkpatrick’s NYT piece is a good start.


09Mar2014 			Libyan Oil Stolen at Sidra		
Sadly, one of the most feared events heralding further collapse of the Libyan state has taken place. A North Korean oil tanker has actually docked at Sidra, one of the Eastern oil ports held by armed federalists, and loaded a cargo of 350,000 barrels of crude oil, leading the group one step closer to selling the oil and stealing the proceeds away from the rest of the country where it could easily be siphoned into the personal pockets of protest leader Ibrahim Jadhran.
As we wrote on 6 March for the latest issue of RUSI Newsbrief:
“[I]f eastern federalists aligned with Ibrahim Jadhran were able to secure international recognition for a Cyrenaican autonomous region, or managed to sell their oil on the open (global) market without government permission, the federalist menace would be immeasurably strengthened. The government would then be faced with the options of accepting the de facto partition of the country or re-igniting a hot war to reclaim the oilfields. Even worse, Jadhran’s successes could inspire other armed ‘warlords’ to imitate him by seizing territory. In this scenario, Libya’s myriad militia groups would initiate a carve-up of the national patrimony.”
Why was no military action taken to prevent this tanker from docking when a Maltese-flagged tanker was successfully prevented from docking at Sidra by the Libyan Navy in January? The answer may worryingly lie in the political infighting between the GNC and Prime Minister that have plagued the country for months. According to the Libya Herald:
“This evening, Zeidan said that the Army Chief of Staff refused to take orders from him or the Ministry of Defence and would only answer to the GNC and Commander-in-Chief – a role temporarily occupied by GNC head Nuri Abu Sahmain. This does not explain why no action has yet been taken, however, as Gajam said this afternoon that the General Chief of Staff, Abdulsalam Al-Obaidi, had been instructed to take the necessary action to deal with the ship as an illegal target.”
The government response, too little too late, has been to threaten to attack the already-loaded tanker, but ending up between a rock and a hard place. While it would be disastrous politically to allow the tanker to leave, it would be an environmental disaster if the oil from the damaged ship spilled into the harbor.


08Mar2014 			The Future of Libya: Is ‘Pakistanisation’ a Foregone Conclusion?		
I have written an article with Haley Cook in the latest issue of the RUSI Newsbrief published by the Royal United Services Institute entitled, “The Future of Libya: Is ‘Pakistanisation’ a Foregone Conclusion?” This article looks at the possible paths for Libya after the third anniversary of the 2011 uprisings and the 20 February constitutional committee election. In the best case scenario, Libya would be stable and prosperous with a vibrant, diversified economy, strong human capital, and robust democratic institutions. In the worst case scenario, the Libyan state would collapse into complete chaos, with the government controlling barely only the capital and the rest of the country fragmenting into renewed civil conflict by warlords grabbing resources. In our estimation, given the current state of affairs, the future lies somewhere inbetween.
As we have written:
 “There still remains a narrow window for Libya to navigate its present obstacles, but this opportunity is fast closing as the state’s finances rapidly deteriorate in the face of oil blockades, and as the political legitimacy of the country’s parliament is imperilled by popular protests and the fudged compromises that have allowed it to temporarily overstay its mandate – but which have also transformed it into an Islamist-backed body.”
And also:
“The most likely political future for Libya, however, is a hybrid scenario that falls short of Afghanistan-like anarchy, but allows for an overwhelming level of political patronage and corruption that would prevent Libya from truly reaching its economic and democratic potential. Such a scenario might be termed ‘Pakistanisation’, since the Libyan state would remain weak but intact as its various institutions were carved up and subjected to a loose power-sharing arrangement.”

08Mar2014 			An Absurd Connection between Ukraine and Libya		
And I don’t mean that the world’s Foreign Ministers spent most of the Friend’s of Libya conference talking about Ukraine, but rather Lindsey Graham’s Tweet as described by James Traub of FP:
Obama’s cautious response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of the Ukrainian region of Crimea has confirmed his growing reputation as a weak-willed figure whose faltering leadership has sent a message of impunity to the world’s bullies. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham recently tweeted that Obama’s failure to attack the Libyans who killed U.S. diplomat Chris Stevens in 2012 invited “this type of aggression.”  Graham has a partisan ax to grind, but much of the commentariat has followed suit. My colleague David Rothkopf, straining for terms of abuse sufficient to the moment, has written that comparing Obama to Jimmy Carter, the gold standard for presidential weakness, may be “unfair to Carter.”


06Mar2014 			Possible Presidential Election?		
For those keeping up with the latest scheduled events in Libyan national elections and constitution writing, there has been yet another change to the timeline. February’s amendment to the Constitutional Declaration kept the GNC in power beyond 7 February, under the condition that elections for a new legislature will be held in June if the special February Committee (a mix of GNC members and outside experts) determines that a new draft constitution will not be ready by July. The February Committee has just decided that June’s potential elections would not not only be for a new Congress, but also for an elected president. The new president would select the prime minister, who in turn would select a new cabinet. This new government, the third interim government since the end of the 2011 Revolution, would last for no longer than 18 months.
It is promising to see that the February Committee has already thought long and hard about carefully delineating powers between the President (head of state) and the Prime Minister, given that the lack of clear separation of powers in the current government has caused much deleterious political infighting between President Nuri Abu Sahmain and Prime Minister Ali Zeidan. It also remains to be seen what kind of effect the announcement that the third interim government will be a presidential rather than parliamentary system will have on the new constitution. More on this story is available here from Magharebia: “February Committee proposes new Libya legislature”.


03Mar2014 			GNC Members’ Cars Burned as Protestors Vandalise Congress		
While the eyes of the world are turned to Ukraine, more horrors are happening right in front of our eyes in Libya.  Read about the latest and boldest attack on GNC members, their property, and their legitimacy from the Libya Herald by clicking here. The irony is people are protesting the GNC because it is too weak and they want a strong central authority to build the country and conquer the myriad low level insurgencies. Yet they seemingly fail to grasp that obvious that it is attacks like this that are part of the reason why the periphery is dominating the centre. This time the protestors appear to be the Zintan style anti-Brotherhood types making their actions all the more disruptive and pointless.
The number of protestors swelled to nearly 500 late this evening, all condemning the wave of assassinations in Benghazi, Derna and Sirte and denouncing the GNC and government’s inaction over the country’s ongoing security crisis…..
Another young protester said he was there in solidarity with Benghazi which has seen waves of protests this week against the deteriorating security in the city.He said that Congress was completely controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood and was heavily influenced by foreign agendas.


01Mar2014 			The Battle for Benghazi		
Fred Wehrey of the Carnegie institute has just written a very detailed, very interesting, American-centric and security-centric narrative about the struggle between extreme Islamists and the security forces in Benghazi for The Atlantic online.  He is brave in the way he has conducted the research and the conclusions he draws.
 To enter Benghazi is to enter a city under siege. Unseen assailants spray checkpoints with automatic weapons; security men and military officers perish in booby-trapped cars. The staccato of nightly gunfire and pre-dawn explosions have assumed a customary quality. The culprits go undiscovered and unpunished.
Every day, Bukhamada’s special forces struggle for power and authority with a constellation of Islamist militias with deep roots in the city. Sa’iqa soldiers have been the targets of an assassination campaign, and Bukhamada’s own son was kidnapped in late January. The outcome of this contest will have an impact not only on the city, but also on the future of Libya’s army—and on the country’s democratic transition…..
Today, many Libyans point to the Shield project as the original sin of the National Transitional Council—a Faustian bargain that put the country on a downward trajectory. In the space of two years, the Shields rapidly became a shadow army with greater power than the country’s regular forces. The monthly government salary for a Shield member exceeded that of a regular policeman and army recruit, giving militia members or would-be recruits little incentive to join the government’s security forces…
For the Islamist militias and Shields, Bukhamada’s Sa’iqa is at once an uneasy partner and an implacable foe, in part as a result of historical memory. Under Qaddafi, the special forces spearheaded a ferocious crackdown on an Islamist uprising in Benghazi and the Green Mountains during the late 1990s. Although many leaders of that uprising fought side-by-side with the Sa’iqa during the 2011 revolution, the bad blood runs deep.
Today, many Islamists are dismissive of the Sa’iqa’s capabilities and suspicious of its motivations. Ismail Sallabi, the former commander of the Benghazi-based Rafallah al-Sahati Companies, asserted in an interview with me last spring that nothing could get done in the city without the Islamists and revolutionaries. The Sa’iqa’s ranks were filled with “drug users and womanizers,” and their contributions to security and policing were frequently heavy-handed and clumsy. “They still think they are fighting in Sirte,” he charged. “They would use Grad rockets to go after drug smugglers.” ….
I asked the 22nd Battalion commander about Benghazi’s worsening violence and what should be done about it. He shrugged. “We offered the 22nd Battalion to help Bukhamada but he declined. He said he has it under control,” he explained. And then: “I guess he’s a hero there and he doesn’t need any more heroes.”
