29May2014 			Thinni Vows to Stay On		
As if Libya really needed another nested political crisis!  Well despite the convincing nature of Ahmed Matig’s re-election, it is still not uncontested that he is prime minister. Some say he Matig is PM elect but Al-Thinni apparently doesn’t think so.  This shows the polarization between the two camps with everyone having to take side and deal with their alternative command structures and alliance networks.
Following Maetig’s election, Thinni said he had been presented with two letters from the General National Congress (GNC), one from GNC President Nuri Abu Sahmain asking him to resign, and another from the GNC first Deputy Ezzedine Al-Awami asking him to stay on.
The Caretaker Prime Minister told reporters that, given the ambiguity, he had passed the matter on to the Ministry of Justice which had responded with its verdict two days ago. Read more from LH by clicking here.


28May2014 			Ansar al-Sharia Mishandles the Media War		
Sometimes Jihadists can conduct savvy public relations campaigns, but a lot of the time they seem to just put their foot in their mouth and play into their opponents hands.  This is what appears to have happened with Ansar Sharia’s latest pronouncements.  Moreover, the escalation of conflict in Libya’s East appears to have been just what the doctor ordered for Hiftar as he can demonstrate that he is the only one of Libya’s leader’s serious enough to take action.  You can read here how Ansar al-Sharia have denounced Operation Karama as a Crusade against Islam.  Or you can read here about the airstrikes in Benghazi here which appear to be a broadening of the anti-Islamist campaign to include a crackdown on MB aligned groups like the Feb 17 Brigade.
Spokesman for General Khalifa Hafter, Mohammed Al-Hijezi, confirmed to the Libya Herald that the Libyan National Army was carrying out the operation which was targeting February 17 Brigade and Ansar Al-Sharia forces at the Gwarsha Gate.
Sporadic fighting has taken place in Benghazi throughout the day after Ansar Al-Sharia last night surrounded Benghazi Security Directorate (BSD), demanding the release of three prisoners and exchanging fire with security forces.
The sound of bombing and anti-aircraft fire ould be heard across Benghazi. Residents said these were the worst clashes in the city since General Khalifa Hifter launched Operation Dignity over a week and a half ago.

23May2014 			A Sober Evaluation of Hiftar’s Movement (If we can call it that)		
I am of the belief that Hiftar is not the most powerful player in the anti-Islamist coalition and that the Saiqa and the Zintanis are militarily more important, however politically it can’t be denied that he is emerging as a power player, stakeholder, and deal maker.  Now is the time for him to make a deal with his enemies and preserve the peace in Libya.  Ian Black of the Guardian consulted me in a crafting an article which puts forth a useful overview of the situation.  To read it you may click here.  I disagree with George Joffe’s pronouncement that things may disintegrate into Civil War. I don’t see that as on the cards for Libya.
In less then a week key army units, political parties and tribal forces have rallied under [Hiftar's]  banner. On Thursday tension mounted  when a powerful brigade from Misrata [opposed to Hiftar] deployed in the centre of the capital. The renegade general’s moves are being closely watched both at home and abroad.
Heftar’s old links with the CIA have come back to haunt him – with enemies denouncing him as an American “agent”. In Libya‘s charged political mood, the accusation is toxic but it may be misleading or simply old news. For the record the US has denied backing him; he has also denied being in contact with Washington. Several former senior US intelligence officials told the Guardian that, while they did not have direct knowledge, they did not believe the US was backing Heftar. Instead, they say, his current offensive should be seen as an audition for future US backing. By showing that he can take on the Islamist militias and win, he establishes himself as somebody the west cannot ignore.
In February Heftar put his head above the parapet with a televised speech denouncing the government and announcing its overthrow. The dramatic appeal failed to spark an uprising but it marked Heftar out as the figurehead for opposition.
Critics compare him to Egypt’s army commander Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, who overthrew the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi last July and is now poised to be elected president. Heftar, like Sisi, is said to have the enthusiastic backing of the fiercely anti-Islamist United Arab Emirates, as does his ally, the former prime minister Mahmoud Jibril. Heftar even created a Supreme Council of the Armed Forces – the same name used by the Egyptian military.
But direct comparisons are not helpful. Libya’s armed forces are nothing like as strong as their mighty Egyptian counterparts. “No one is fooled when Heftar says he is leading the national army,” said Jason Pack of Libya-analysis.com. “That’s just another militia.”
Heftar’s momentum could change that. His Operation Karama (“dignity”) has blazed across Libya with army units, tribes and the largest non-Islamist party, the National Forces Alliance, all declaring their allegiance. But victory is far from certain – and the risks are considerable.
“Heftar’s initiative is responding to a deeply felt need,” said Libya expert George Joffe. “Even if he is not the man of the moment he might appeal to a popular mood that will allow him to carry on. The danger is that it will collapse into civil war.”
 


23May2014 			The World According to Hiftar		
The Media (Western and Arab) seems to be slavishly presenting the pronouncements of Khalifa Hiftar without delving deeper into the realities that are emerging on the ground in Libya.  Here is one of the better articles from Middle East Online but it still falls prey to this pattern.  Each side has its own prime minister and its own narrative so not questioning what is going on and seeing multiple viewpoints is absurd.
Claiming to speak in the name of the army, Khalifa Haftar Wednesday urged the country’s highest judicial authority “to form a civilian presidential high council tasked with forming an emergency cabinet and organising legislative elections”.
Highlighting the seriousness of the security threat, the navy’s chief of staff, Rear Admiral Hassan Abu Shnak, his driver and two guards were wounded Wednesday when gunmen attacked his convoy in Tripoli.
Despite the tensions, the situation was almost normal in Tripoli and Benghazi, where shops, banks and governments were open.
Prime Minister Ahmed Miitig called Wednesday for dialogue among all protagonists while affirming that “Libyans don’t want to be ruled by the military,” referring to the rogue general.



19May2014 			“Leaders” of Libyan Army “Suspend” GNC		
Well, it is not surprising that it would come to this (another attempted anti-GNC) coup as there is a constant and increasing polarization of Libya’s political factions into opposing camps.  And no one can agree on what constitutes legitimate parliamentary practice — so much so that Libya does not have an agreed upon Prime Minister at present.  That Khiftar has linked up with the Zintanis who form something of his Western extension is exactly what we would expect given the alliance network that has formed against the Misratans and Islamists throughout the country.  For those of you interested in reading about the background to the current events and getting a sense of who the different players are please consult the militia mapping I conducted with my colleagues Karim Mezran and Mohamed Eljarh in a recently published Atlantic Council report, “Libya’s Faustian Bargains: Breaking the Appeasement Cycle”.  For a quick primer about what is happening right now, the Libya Herald is as always about the best English language source available. It is clear that many in the Libyan populace support any actions to repress the Islamist extremists they see in their midst and crave a Sisi-like figure, yet is is unclear to even seasoned Libya observers if ‘the populace’ will support the crudeness with which this anti-Islamist putsch has been undertaken. Moreover, talking to friends in Libya, I have heard that the public relations campaign undertaken on behalf of the Putschists has been very weak and unconvincing indeed.  Will Misrata sit idly by while their candidate Matig and their grip on the GNC is undone?  Will they attempt to negotiate and then resort to violence?  Allahu ‘Alam (God only knows)  What seems clear is that a grand bargain is now needed between Libya’s myriad actors and compromise and long-term thinking must be the order of the day or the future of the country and the transition will already be lost.  Below is the quick Libya Herald article to catch you up to speed.
A group of five officers identifying themselves as the “Leaders of the Libyan Army” have announced the suspension the General National Congress (GNC) and that the current government is to remain in office. In a four-point plan laid out by Colonel Muktar Fernana, a Zintani former head of military intelligence,  the “Leaders of the Libyan Army” this evening announced that the Constitutional Assembly would take over the work of the GNC and that Abdullah Al-Thinni’s current government would oversee the formation of the military and security forces. The statement essentially blocked the premiership of Ahmed Maetig who was elected by the GNC at the beginning of this month. Congress was supposed to vote and accept Maetig’s new government today before the attacks on the GNC building began. It is not clear if the five were linked to the assault on Congress, undertaken by the Qaaqaa and Sawaiq brigades, or to Colonel Khalifa Hafter, whose forces also call themselves the “Libyan National Army “.  The two brigades have stated that they are not under Hafter’s orders. Fernana’s statement concluded that the people of Libya “would never accept to be controlled by  a group or organisation which initiates terror and chaos”.
 
 


17May2014 			Game Theory, Kidnappings and the Pitfalls of Appeasement in Libya		
No matter how you slice it, releasing a convicted terrorist as a means to free a kidnapped ambassador is appeasement and sets a dangerous precedent which is likely to lead to further kidnapping. I expanded on this argument in a piece in the Middle East Eye.
On the face of things, it might seem a fair proposition to speculate that high-level decision makers in the Jordanian or Libyan governments would understand iterative game theory – the study of strategic decision making – better than the thugs of ragtag Islamist militias.  However, recent events suggest the Libyan militias are geniuses at extortion, blackmail, kidnapping, and intervening in the political process. So much so, that it seems they are displaying a good grasp of the nuances of game theory.
As Karim Mezran, Mohamed Eljarh and I have explained in a recently published Atlantic Council report, “Libya’s Faustian Bargains: Ending the Appeasement Cycle”, appeasement is always a trap – the more you practice it the harder it becomes to break out of the cycle.
So the situation in Libya today has reached something of the natural conclusion of the cycle of appeasement of which kidnappings are only one manifestation.  Other key manifestations are granting important government posts to militia- or jihadist-aligned individuals such that whole branches of the government, especially the Defence or Interior ministry, have been colonized by specific localities, regions, or militias.
The primary issues must be solved by Libyans themselves, who need to confront the enemies of law and order in their own midst and double down on their transition process to constitutional governance.  Nonetheless, Libya’s nascent central authorities could use a little help from their friends.


16May2014 			Libya: Swinging Pendulums and Political Crematoria		
Here is an interesting article by Mansour Omar Al-Kikhia in Al-Jazeera English which comments on why Ahmed Matig has become the PM and how his connections with business and Misrata hold him in good stead for his job but nonetheless his selection shows the deep rivalries in Libya’s West and yet does not show a way forward for their conclusion.
The new prime minister is Ahmed Maiteeq, a 42-year-old businessman who lives in Tripoli but has strong links to Misurata. His uncle and backer is Abdul Rahman al-Swaihli, an influential member of Congress and the Swaihli dynasty of Misurata. Maiteeq was elected by the General National Congress (GNC) in a nowdisputed vote to form a “crisis government of national unity.”
Maiteeq major rival was Omar al-Hassi who hails from the east of the country. Hassi is not a particularly impressive figure yet he obtained the support of Zintan as well as some of the progressive votes in the GNC. The Cyrenaican vote was split between Hassi and another candidate from the east who was even less impressive.
So why Maiteeq? Why bring to the fore a relatively unknown political novice? First, he has huge guns behind him that has given him an edge that none of the other prime ministers possess. Second, he is young and brings a different perspective to the table. Third, he pleases the business community in the country.  To read the whole article click here. 


14May2014 			Jordanian Ambassador Freed After Libya Kidnap		
Jordan’s ambassador to Libya has been freed after being abducted by gunmen in the capital Tripoli last month according to the BBC.  This shows a kind of appeasement as the Jordanian government had to cave into militia demands to get their ambassador released.


08May2014 			Libya’s Unexpected Strength		
Here is some more fascinating analysis from Dirk Vandewalle in the NYT. I certainly agree with some of Dirk’s points and strongly agree that a new electoral method is needed for the house of representatives to make the body at all functional and not fall pray to the same cleavages as are present in the GNC.  He points to the key issue of allowing a voting method that allows Libyans to express their solidarity with each other instead of stressing their local allegiances.

Libya faces fiendishly difficult problems, but there is at least one tangible issue that could be fixed fairly easily. Reforming current electoral rules would close the gap between the people and their leaders, and make good on an enviable asset that is rare in such fragile countries: a popular consensus on major issues that transcends cleavages over smaller ones.

08May2014 			Ides of March Cambridge Invitational Tournament – March 2014		
In this GammonVillage article I explain the novel round robin format used in the backgammon tournament I hosted at my home in Cambridge, while also analyzing the interesting positions and cube decisions that ensued.
In the past few decades, the knockout tournament format, with progressive consolation rounds and a last chance, all consisting of matches of odd-number of points (i.e. 7 or 11 or 17 pointers) has achieved a near-hegemonic status within the backgammon world, but it is far from the only conceivable tournament format. In fact, some of the best and most respected tournaments in the world use other formats. Partisans of Swiss tournaments (e.g Chicago Open) or double elimination tournaments (e.g. Nordic) will say that those formats are not only more enjoyable but are more likely to favor skill, while being conducive to all attendees having fun and getting in as many meaningful matches as possible. Sadly, although Chicago and Nordic are universally respected few tournament directors are willing to apply their spirit of innovation to their own tournaments.
Having experimented with many possible tournament formats, I believe a round robin format of different match lengths — especially stressing even-numbered match lengths — can be particularly enjoyable, while also rewarding a deeper understanding of match score dynamics and human psychology. This format certainly has its draw backs as it is time consuming, is best suited for smaller more “intimate” events, and requires having a suitable number of participants. Nonetheless, it maximizes the amount of backgammon played by all the participants and promotes the social aspect of the game by assuring that all participants play with and get to meet each other. Although it is impossible to declare one tournament format as the ideal, having now hosted a round robin tournament of different match lengths, I can say fairly definitively that it promoted the psychological and intellectual challenges that we all relish in backgammon.

07May2014 			Who’s for Prime Minister?		
Another uniquely and characteristically Libyan controversy is emerging: opposing factions are disputing who is Libya’s legitimate Prime Minister. Those who don’t want Ahmed Matig to be prime minister allege that the voting session in the GNC had closed before he got the requisite 121 votes, while those supporting him say that although the deputy head of the GNC (Awami) tried to close the session what matters is that Nuri Abusahmain the speaker of the GNC and President of Libya gave his approval for the voting to continue even though he was not present.  There are many articles out there on what has or has not transpired and many of them lack credibility.  Therefore, I’m presenting one from the Economist which I believe to be carefully researched.
On May 4th Ahmed Omar Matiq (pictured), a 42-year-old Islamist-leaning hotelier, was announced as the new prime minister by the second deputy speaker, who said the candidate had won 121 votes in the 200-member congress, one more than required. But the first deputy speaker disagreed. He said that the only legal vote was the one he had himself supervised earlier in the day, when Mr Matiq had gained just 113 votes, too few to clinch him the top job.
For the rest of the day confusion prevailed. The congress declared Mr Matiq to be the new prime minister. But the prime minister’s office contradicted it, saying that Abdullah al-Thinni, who had been appointed to the job only in mid-March, was still in the post. “Libya has Two Prime Ministers” was the headline in that evening’s English-language Libya Herald.
The next day the congressional speaker, Nuri Abu Sahmain, who had been absent during the previous proceedings, emerged to announce that Mr Matiq was indeed the new head of government, apparently under terms granted to the speaker enabling him to make decisions by decree. Mr Abu Sahmain had been absent since prosecutors announced last month that he was being investigated for possible sexual impropriety with two women, a touchy issue in Muslim Libya. But after he had declared Mr Matiq the prime minister, opposition members of the congress challenged the legality of the process. Mr Abu Sahmain then announced that Mr Thinni would anyway stay in place for another two weeks, since the British-educated Mr Matiq would need time to prepare for a congressional vote of confidence before his government could get going.
