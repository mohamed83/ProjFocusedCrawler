EUGENE, Ore. -- We're learning more about a shooting in south Eugene Friday that sent a neighborhood into lockdown.


Two men are confirmed dead.


Investigators say the alleged shooter lured the victim to the 21-hundred block of McLean Boulevard, posing as a woman wanting to hire him for a photo shoot.


The victim, John Ramsey Tainton-Platts, 33, was a professional photographer.


According to Eugene police, Tainton-Platts was dating the estranged wife of the suspect, Nicholas Hazel, 48.


Investigators say Hazel, posing as a woman, scheduled the photoshoot with Tainton-Platts on Tuesday, August 25 via electronic message.


 


Hazel gave an address near his house, 2132 McLean Boulevard.


Police are unsure about the sequence of events leading up to Tainton-Platts' arrival to the home but say his car was parked in Hazel's driveway.


When police responded to the reports of gun shots, they found Tainton-Platts wounded on the ground.


"Immediately after the shooting, Mr. Hazel sent an electronic message to his estranged wife stating he had just murdered her 'lover boy', as he refered to him, which was Tainton-Platts. Mr. Hazel said that he, himself, was next," said Det. Jeff Donaca with Eugene police.


Police say it appears Hazel died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was found in the garage.


Eugene police used robots to enter the home and search the residence for Hazel.


Neighbors say they were shocked because their south Eugene neighborhood is quiet and it was bizarre to have police on scene for 12 hours.
