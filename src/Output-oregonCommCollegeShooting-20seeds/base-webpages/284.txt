Final summary






10 people are dead and seven injured
 after a man, believed to be 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer, opened fire on students and staff at the Umpqua community college in Oregon.


Police received a call about an active shooter at the campus at 10.38am.


Harper Mercer died
 during a shootout with police, authorities said.


The father of one injured victim said 
Harper Mercer asked people about their religion
 before shooting them.


Three of the seven injured are in a critical condition.


The 
identities of victims will be released on Friday
 in the US, sheriff John Hanlin said, but he would not name the shooter and “give him the credit he probably sought”.


Police were searching an apartment in Winchester, Oregon, about 3km from campus, believed to be Harper Mercer’s home.


Harper Mercer’s 
 hinted at 
an interest in mass shootings
, with a torrent account showing he uploaded a BBC documentary about the Sandy Hook killings just three days ago.


Hundreds gathered in a Roseburg park for a candlelit vigil mourning the victims.


Barack Obama said 
 and urged people to lobby their government representatives to change the laws and legislate gun control. He blamed Congress for blocking legislation.


A 2013 letter from sheriff Hanlin, who is leading the response, to vice president Joe Biden lobbies against gun control. In the letter 
Hanlin vows he would refuse to enforce or allow the enforcement of any federal gun control laws
 because it was “unconstitutional” and an “insult to American people”.


It is the 45th school shooting in the US for this year alone, and the 142nd since the attack at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012.

Jason Wilson has filed a report from the neighbourhood of Chris Harper-Mercer.




Steven Fisher, who lives in a neighbouring block, positively identified the man in the picture as his neighbour.


“Yeah I’d see him in the back yard, sometimes with a couple of kids,” said Fisher.


Fisher was referring to a large, open space shared by three blocks, each containing six apartments. He didn’t know what the relationship between the man and the children was, and didn’t know the man by name.


“I stay to myself when I come home from work,” he said.


Other residents of the block said they did not recognize the man.

Stacey Boylan, father of 18-year-old Anastasia Boylan who was injured in the attack, has told CNN his daughter survived by “playing dead”.










 




He came in and there was gunfire immediately and he scattered the room. From what I understood what she said was he shot the professor point blank, one shot killed him.


Others had been injured and then this man had enough time – I don’t know how much time elapsed – he was able to stand there and start asking people one by one what their religion was. ‘Are you a Christian?’ he would ask them, and ‘if you are a Christian then stand up’ and they would stand up. He’d say ‘because you are a Christian you’re going to see God in about one second’ and then he shot and killed them. And he kept going down the line doing this to people.


How much time do you need?


She said he had a handgun. It wasn’t a big rifle or an assault rifle. This was a single handgun and he had enough ammunition and enough time to drop the magazine out of it, put another one in and continue his thing. How does he have that much time at a facility?


I don’t understand that. How he could have that much time to kill that many people.”

The college campus had as strong a gun policy as the state laws allowed, according to the US gun violence prevention group, Everytown for gun safety.


It says 
 law dictates colleges cannot completely prohibit the carrying of guns on campuses.


“At the time of the shooting, Umpqua Community College had as strong a policy as Oregon law permits, which necessarily fell short of a full prohibition,” said Everytown’s communications director, Erika Soto Lamb. 


“The college’s policy acknowledged that some campus carry activity was ‘expressly authorized by law’ and beyond the school’s control.”

Associated Press has spoken with a neighbour of Chris Harper-Mercer.


Bronte Hart, who lived below the man believed to have killed nine people, said Harper-Mercer “seemed really unfriendly”.


Hart says Mercer would “sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light” and that a woman she believed to be Mercer’s mother also lived upstairs and was “crying her eyes out” Thursday.

 is in Oregon and has filed the below dispatch.




The suspect’s apparent home was an apartment in a small, nondescript block, located at the end of a cul de sac in a leafy outer suburb of Roseburg, with pleasant views of nearby hills.


Police sealed the building earlier this afternoon. In the early evening, carloads of investigators were still arriving, choking up the small carpark at the front of the building. There were state and local uniforms, plain clothes police, and dogs. Those patrolling the tape were tight-lipped about what was happening inside. 


None of the neighbours milling around appeared to have interacted with Chris Harper-Mercer, but they were surprised something like this could happen in their quiet neighbourhood. “Maybe in Portland,” offered Kiona, who was standing on the opposite kerb, “But here, in Roseburg?”


The prevailing emotion in this community still seems to be disbelief.

Profiles on social media, dating and other online sites are emerging with apparent connections to 
Chris Harper-Mercer
. Screen shots of a conversation on the 4chan message board are

One post in the conversation states: “don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest.”


The conversation is under investigation and not confirmed to be linked – a similar online posting around the time of the Sandy Hook shooting was later found to be unconnected.

Sheriff John Hanlin has just addressed media. 


“We have information which leads us to believe we know who the shooter is.” Hanlin said the official ID will come from the medical examiner, and he will not name the shooter.


“I will not give him the credit he probably sought with this horrific and cowardly act,” said Hanlin.


“You will never hear me mention his name.”


Tactical teams and bomb squads have cleared all buildings and are currently working to clear all vehicles on site. Federal officers are examining the crime scene.


Hanlin and his officer took no questions and said this was the last public briefing.

Summary




The incident is still ongoing, as is the investigation into the perpetrator of the mass shooting, but here is the information we currently have:


To reiterate an earlier post, we are still seeking to confirm reports of the shooter’s identity.




Police received a call about an active shooter at the Umpqua community college campus at 10.38am.


The shooter and police exchanged gun fire and the shooter is dead.


Nine or 10 people were killed, and seven injured. Three of the seven are in a critical condition. 


The identities of victims are unlikely to be revealed for 24-48 hours.


Barack Obama said shootings in the US had become “routine” and urged people to lobby their government representatives to change the laws and legislate gun control.


County sheriff John Hanlin, leading the response, had written to vice president Joe Biden in 2013 vowing he would refuse to enforce or allow the enforcement of any federal gun control laws because it was “unconstitutional” and an “insult to American people”.


It is the 45th school shooting in the US for this year alone, and the 142nd since the attack at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012.

The Brady Campaign, another pro-gun control group, has also released a statement on the Umpqua shooting.


“We join the rest of the nation in shock, horror, and grief as the news of today’s school shooting in Oregon continues to unfold,” said Dan Gross, president of the campaign. 










 




What should have been a sanctuary for education and a symbol of bright futures will now become the latest memorial of victims lost to America’s gun violence epidemic.”


While investigators continue their work to understand what would drive someone to commit such a crime, we will also be eager to learn more about how and where the shooter obtained the gun or guns. Our hearts are with the families, friends, and community members of all those who were killed or injured in this tragedy.

A 20-year-old student from New Zealand was among those who fled the shooter, 


Jaylen Gerrand had been at the Umpqua community college for two weeks on a basketball scholarship. Gerrand reportedly spoke to his New Zealand based coach, Jeff Green, the Herald reported.


“He was running alongside a guy and the guy was shot dead – the guy running next him,” Green told the Herald.


“He ran past three others that were shot dead, so it was horrifying, horrific.


“So he saw four people dead. He’s totally distressed, totally distressed. He just wants to come home right now. It’s a huge, huge tragedy.”


The 
New Zealand prime minister, John Key,
 is in New York and told media: “The tragedy for the United States in recent times is that this isn’t the first and sadly it doesn’t look like it’s going to be the last. The United States has hundreds and hundreds of millions of guns in circulation. From Virginia Tech to the most recent in Oregon we’ve just seen far too many innocent people killed as a result of that.”

CNN is reporting four firearms – three handguns and one “long gun” – have been recovered at the scene, citing an unnamed source. The information was not provided by sheriff Hanlin in his on the record briefing a few moments ago.


Earlier today vice president Joe Biden predicted investigators would find a semi-automatic or automatic weapon, based on the large number of casualties.


Biden also renewed his calls for “sane gun legislation”.


The vice president was speaking at a global summit in New York, Associated Press reported.


He said the Second Amendment doesn’t allow someone to own a bazooka. There’s almost nothing worse than getting a phone call saying, “Your child is gone,” Biden said, alluding to his own son’s brain cancer death earlier this year.

10 dead, seven injured, says sheriff




Sheriff Hanlin has just given another press conference with the latest information on the shooting.


“It’s very early in this event and we are still trying to confirm a great amount of information floating around,” Hanlin said.


“Our victims and families of our victims are our priority. Everything we do from here on will be for them.”


Hanlin confirmed there were 
10 people killed
 in the shooting. 
Seven were injured, three critically.


There are conflicting reports of the number of casualties, but “this number is the best, most accurate information we have at this time,” Hanlin said.


The incident has been deemed a “mass casualty event” which unlocks resources and specific protocols to the area. The protocols include notifying individual families as a priority, Hanlin said, meaning 
the identities of victims are not likely to be made public for another 24-48 hours.


The investigation into the shooter continues. “We are not ready at this time to make any comments about him.”

A letter has emerged, written by Douglas County sheriff John Hanlin to vice president Joe Biden, urging against gun control which he said would be “an indisputable insult to the American people”.


“Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” wrote Hanlin in January 2013.


The letter, 
, from Hanlan also states 
he would refuse to enforce any gun controls laws
 the US government may pass, and would not allow any of his deputies or any federal officers to enforce them.










 




The United States supreme court has ruled that when a sheriff chooses to enforce an unconstitutional directive, he is violating his Constitutional Oath. I will NOT violate my constitutional oath.


...any federal regulation enacted by Congress or by executive order of the President offending the Constitutional rights of my citizens shall not be enforced by me or by my deputies, nor will I permit the enforcement of any unconstitutional regulations or orders by federal officers within the borders of Douglas County Oregon.


In conclusion, it is my position as Sheriff of Douglas County, Oregon that I will refuse to participate in, nor tolerate enforcement actions against citizens that are deemed unconstitutional.”






According to Mother Jones, Hanlin is 
 to offer support to the constitutional sheriffs and peace officers association (CSPOA), an organisation founded by a former Arizona sheriff, which touts itself as the “last line of defence” against “unconstitutional gun control measures.”

“There was a huge pop. It sounded like a ruler smacking against a chalkboard. Everyone jumped and we didn’t know what was going on. Then there was another one.”


Hannah said there were noises from the next room, “people shuffling, kind of talking” and the teacher went to the door and knocked on it, asking if everything was OK in there. There were more shots.


“Then everything went quiet. The look on her face was horrifying, and she said we all needed to get out.”

“This is not something I can do by myself,” he says, calling on Congress, state governors and legislatures to back him. 


“I hope and pray that I don’t have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences ... based on my experiences as president I can’t guarantee that and that’s a terrible thing to say,” he says.

Obama: 'Somehow this has become routine'




Obama begins by paying his respects to those killed and injured in today’s shooting. He says he has visited Roseburg before, and there are “good people there”. 


“In the coming days,” he says we will learn about those who have died. “Young men, women studying hard, dreaming of what they could make of their lives.” He says they are in his prayers.


He then goes on to make a furious, impassioned call for gun reform. 


“Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. 
It’s not enough.
 It does not capture the heartache and anger we should feel ... it does not prevent this carnage in some other place in America,” Obama says. 


He expresses exasperation at the many times he has addressed the nation following a mass shooting.


“Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium is routine ... We’ve become numb to this.”

My colleague

 in Washington has been monitoring how various presidential candidates have reacted to the shooting, as details continue to emerge. 


Ben reports: 


Presidential campaigns of both parties are starting to react to the campus shooting in Roseburg today by offering their prayers and extending their condolences to families and victims of those affected.


The first to react was former Florida governor Jeb Bush






— Jeb Bush (@JebBush)




Praying for Umpqua Community College, the victims, and families impacted by this senseless tragedy.








He has since been joined by several other candidates:






— Martin O'Malley (@MartinOMalley)




My heart is with those who lost so much today in Oregon. -O’M












— John Kasich (@JohnKasich)




The thoughts and prayers of Ohioans go out to the families & victims of the tragic shooting in Oregon today. -John












— George E. Pataki (@GovernorPataki)




It's with a heavy heart that we all pray for those killed or injured in Oregon today. 












— David Chalian (@DavidChalian)




Per the pool reporter, 
 on shooting: "We have to get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe."








While 
none of the candidates are offering explicitly political statements about the shooting
, former 
Attorney General Eric Holder has weighed in on Twitter in a series of messages urging increased restrictions on firearms ownership:






— Eric Holder (@EricHolder)




Now Oregon. We weep again as a nation. Is the answer to our gun violence epidemic to do nothing? Again? Come on America! We solve problems

Enough! Now Oregon. What reason now to oppose safety measures? Other nations have not had these mass shootings after implementing reforms

“We have our share of crime like any peaceful community but certainly this is a shock to have this level of crime or incident happen in our school system.”


He praises the law enforcement response from local counties and the state police, and estimates more than 100 officers are investigating the campus. No officers were injured in the incident, he says.

“It’s a situation where there was no answers for quite some time,” Hanlin says, adding he personally knows many people who were worried for the welfare of their loved ones.


Hanlin says he has not heard anything about a warning posted online to stay away from campus, nor can he say whether the shooting was confined to a single classroom.


He says the shooter fired on police officers after they arrived, but he doesn’t know what type of weapon the gunman had.

“Obviously today here in southern Oregon it has not been a good afternoon, it has been a terrible day,” Hanlin begins.


He says at approximately 10.38am the police received multiple emergency calls, and on arriving at the college officers located the shooter, “engaged that suspect, there was an exchange of gunfire, the shooter threat was neutralized, and officers continued to sweep the campus for other threats.”


He says there are confirmed injuries and confirmed fatalities. “It is a very active scene.”


But Hanlin declines to say whether the attorney general’s statement 13 people had died was correct. “I don’t want to report a number that’s inaccurate.”

A recording of what is apparently the police radio response to the shooting has been 
 with officers audible saying that at “Snyder Hall, somebody is outside one of the doors shooting through the door”.


The information shared by officers in that report remains unconfirmed, but the audio grows increasingly harrowing as clips of sirens and calls for more ambulances flicker into the scanner.


At one moment an officer on the scene gasps for breath as he reports back to others: “Exchanging gunshots with him, he’s in a classroom on the, it’s got to be the south-east side of the hall.”


An officer later says: “suspect is down, we’ve got multiple gunshot wounds, we’re going to need multiple ambulances on the scene.”

Gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety has released statements from shooting survivors; the group notes the Umpqua shooting is the 45th school shooting this year in the US, and the 142nd school shooting since the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012.


“America is the only developed country where when someone asks if you heard about that campus shooting, you have to clarify ‘which one?’ That is unacceptable,” said Colin Goddard, a Virginia Tech survivor and Everytown advocate. “Something has to change. We need to all come together for the Umpqua families today.”


“We are in mourning with the rest of the nation as we learn more about the students, faculty and families affected by the horrific mass shooting today in Roseburg, Oregon,” said Shannon Watt’s founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense. “We don’t have to live this way. Parents in other developed countries don’t receive text messages that say, ‘Mom, active shooter. Love you.’”


“Obviously no one law will prevent every episode of gun violence, but we have a moral imperative to do more to protect our children or we are sacrificing our children to gun laws made by the gun lobby – we must act now to stop this carnage.”

Douglas County commissioner Chris Boice has told local reporters “the threat has been detained”, but he too cannot provide certain details about the suspect’s condition or casualties.


“We’ve had reports of multiple casualties and several more injuries and that’s really all I know,” Boice said. 


The commissioner said he learned of the shooting when one of his staffers “got a phone call from her daughter who was on campus, and the shooting was happening at that point”.


“I ran down the hall, called the sheriff on his cellphone, he was en route to the incident,” Boice said. “We’re a tight knit community and everybody knows everybody.”


“We’re going to be heavily impacted by this and I can’t imagine what those families [of victims] must be feeling right now.”

A gunman has shot multiple people at a college campus in western Oregon, emergency officials have said.


Umpqua Community College was locked down on Thursday and civilians have been advised to stay away from the area, about 180 miles south of Portland. 


A spokesperson for the Douglas County Sheriff’s office told the Guardian police from multiple jurisdictions responded to a 911 call at 10.38am PT, in which the caller reported an active shooter at the school.


The spokesperson said police could not yet confirm any details about casualties or a shooter.

Active shooter scene is code 4. Multiple casualties all pt's transported. Media requests are being handled by Douglas County Major Crimes








Appearing on MSNBC, Ray Shouffler of the Douglas County fire department said a suspected shooter had been “neutralized”.


The college has about 3,000 students and its website and phone line went offline shortly after emergency services alerted residents about the shooting. The Douglas County sheriff’s office did not immediately return a call seeking to confirm details.


The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is on the scene. An agency spokesperson said ATF agents came in from Portland and Eugene, Oregon. The ATF’s K9 unit and an assistant special agent from Seattle have also been dispatched to the scene.
