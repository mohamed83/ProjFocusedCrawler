More than 20 people are injured after a shooting at a community college in Oregon Thursday morning, officials told the Daily News.

The shooter was reported as “down,” with no further details immediately available, said Douglass County commissioner Chris Boice.
One female was shot in the chest on the Roseburg campus, and 20 people were reported as “injured,” he said.
Umpqua Community College is a posted Gun Free Zone but allows concealed carry under Oregon law. The college security page states the following:
“Possession, use, or threatened use of firearms (including but not limited to BB guns, air guns, water pistols, and paint guns) ammunition, explosives, dangerous chemicals, or any other objects as weapons on college property, except as expressly authorized by law or college regulations, is prohibited.
Possession of knives with a blade longer than 4” is prohibited.
Brandishing weapons is prohibited.
Misuse of personal defensive weapons – e.g., pepper spray, etc. is prohibited. The owner is responsible and accountable for any misuse of these devices.”
The college is located on the North Umpqua River and serves Roseburg and the greater Douglas County area. The college was established in 1964 and educates close to 20,000 full and part-time students
This story is breaking and will be updated as more information becomes available.

“except as expressly authorized by law “…….. Oregon Sate law expressly exempts conceal carry permit holders from rules prohibiting carrying guns in  schools K thru college. But one source says lots of schools openly violate that provision and ban guns anyway. Does UCC ban guns in violation of Oregon law?

No they aren’t in violation of state law, state law permits licensed concealed carry they are banning everything else

It sounds like this is the same situation that exists in Minnesota. While it isn’t illegal for a permit holder to carry on campus, its against school rules. So a student would be subject to school discipline and could be expelled. A school employee would be violating their employer’s rules and could be fired.
 Its my understanding that the shooter is 20 years old and you need to be 21 to get a carry permit, so he was carrying illegally. Don’t know if he was a student or not, though school discipline is moot since he’s dead.
 I found it pretty ironic that once I registered for classes, I couldn’t be trusted to carry, but before and after I attended, it was just fine.

I just don’t see how this could have happened.  The Umpqua CC campus is a gun-free zone.  That should have prevented this terrible crime because everyone knows that criminals, terrorists, and mentally unstable killers are among our most law abiding citizens.  They would never, ever carry firearms into a gun-free zone where they would be the only ones with a gun.

As news reports indicate, several students were carrying concealed weapons on campus at the time of the attack.  Roseburg is in rural Oregon.  Average student age is 28, well above the age requirement (21) for an Oregon concealed weapon permit, which overrides any campus rules.

Uh, wrong. Concealed carry is allowed on the campus.
 Problem is, gun-totin’, shoot-em-up RWNJs avoid schools and colleges and institutions of higher learning like the plague.

When will these people learn that it is not the lawful people that carry guns that who hurt people.   It is people disturbed that hurt people.  They have done it by guns, knives, swords, etc. A number of liberal people; yes I am talking about liberals and democrats who are always trying to ban guns and claim conservatives are the issue when it comes to these multiple shooting incidents.   I saw a segment that illustrated a number of persons  who have done these types of crimes voted democrat.  If this is true, maybe the liberal party is just trying to protect themselves from their crazy friends!  I am almost positive if a person or persons would have had their concealed weapon at this school lives would have been saved.

In all fairness, it is … unusual … to see one guy with a knife kill over a dozen people before being subdued.  Injure one or two, sure.  Kill one, less often but it happens (its a lot harder for someone to actually lethally wound someone with a knife than it is to pull the trigger from 20 feet away and ignore what happened).

Easy to spot you as a gun fan and conservative by your grammar.  You are an idiot.

And you are incredibly rude!  But you are right…that all important grammar, makes him an idiot.  Much like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemmingway, Winston Churchill, and Albert Einstein, who were all well documented as having been quite hopeless in grammar.  But I think we can all forgive Einstein, as when it came to math, grammar didn’t much bother him.  Next time you decide to judge someone, better take a good look at yourself.  You may not be nearly as intelligent or perfect as you think you are…..

Oh Judy….let’s not overlook the fact that guns are exactly what resolved this tragedy! But your wright…wee should fokus on the gramer and noth’n else. Priceless comment!

Hi Ken,  You are so right.  Everyone should be able to carry their gun at any time.  I could carry a gun legally where I work.  I work at a public high school.  I am also a retired cop so I have had a lot of training and have a CCW license.  I guess the kids at my school have rights too.  They are covered by the 2nd Amendment.  Yea, 9th graders with 9 mil autos.  I don’t see a problem.  Do you?
 
 
 
 
 
grizz
 
says:
 
fed law says kids unger the age of 18 may not own a hand gun. under 21 may not buy a hand gun. a 9th grader with a 9mm clearly has an adult criminal suppling them

says:
 
Good  for you; well said.  They are the first to say that  it is people who kill, not the guns.  Wow, really? Correct! Which is why we need background checks on people for all gun sales.
 
 
 
 
 
Patrick McNamara
 
says:
 
Background checks ARE required for all purchases, including “gun show” purchases. All knee jerk bleating to the contrary is misinformation. Even a casual transfer must be done through an FFL licence holder. Gun theft, however, is another story. Gun thieves undergo no background check.
 
 
 
 
 
Jim
 
says:
 
No, grandpa jimmy, ninth graders with guns is likely not a good idea but since very rarely is there someone in that ninth grade demographic that is over 21 and legally able to have a CCWL. But, if you are legally licensed, experienced and lawfully permitted to carry as an educator who could protect those same students, DO YOU?

You are spreading factually in accurate information PLEASE STOP! the campus is not a gun free zone Legal concealed carry is allowed on all public schools from K through college in Oregon, Please do your research before you post, a lot of people don’t think they can carry on campus so they don’t and reports like this don’t help

Eric, how many criminals do you know that will go to the trouble to get a permit to carry.
 
 
 
 
 
Terry Hoff

So you’re saying the shooter had a concealed carry permit, right?
 
 
 
 
 
Bryan Johnson
 
says:
 
Aren’t you a special kind of genius. Yes that’s exactly what’s being implied, the shooter had a permit therefore his murder spree was legal, not the fact that people were allowed to conceal carry on campus and yet not one shot the gun man

Now is not the time for this people. The first thing the gun grabbers do is start shouting for new common sense gun laws or in some cases outright bans when there is a tragic shooting. It’s not right when they do it and it’s not right when we do it. Let it play out. give those involved a descent amount of time to get through the shock and have a chance to mourn before you use an ugly situation as a constitutional argument.

Umpqua Community College is one of 206 college campuses that DO expressly allow concealed carry.  Please get your facts straight.

Your headline is totally wrong. You can carry a weapon in Oregon.  Please edit accordingly to adhere to facts:
“Umpqua Community College, however, was not a gun free zone. A 2011, state court decision prohibited public colleges from banning guns on campus. The decision stemmed from a suit filed by the Oregon Firearm Education Foundation, a gun rights group. There was an effort to pass a new law to reinstate the ability of public colleges to ban guns. That measure was defeated by gun rights advocates.”

Legal concealed carry is allowed on campus in Oregon. Legal carry is defined as follows:
“A person who is licensed under ORS 166.291 (Issuance of concealed handgun license) and 166.292 (Procedure for issuing) to carry a concealed handgun.”
 
 
 
 
 
Jim
 
says:
 
Licensed concealed carry is only eligible for over 21 and a community college is a two year college where the vast majority of students are under 21 and the majority of the faculty are anti-gun liberals. Then to post the area as a gun free zone is a invitation to a wack-a-doodle to go there to inflict the maximum carnage.

Well said. When Kennesaw Georgia passed a mandatory gun ownership law 20 years ago all the local criminals moved to Dekalb County.
 Think about it; if you are a criminal do you want to prey upon a gun free location or upon a place with an NRA sticker in the window. Even the security officers at Umpqua were unarmed; which Obama minion made that decision?

For those against guns, you can always count on the police to save you…For those against guns, you can post signs of no gun allowed. How’s that working for you?.

When all is said and done, and the media has had their anti gun rant, we find that this is an Islamic issue…………again! Take our weapons of protection away and then start putting us away in their FEMA camps, because we are the dangerous ones. GUN FREE ZONES DON’T WORK!!!!!! Who else would go round asking what religion you are? Wake up, America, your president is a commie loving mohamedingdong terrorist.

How’s that “gun-free zone” working out for ya?
 
 
 
 
 
Jim
 
says:
 
Whether Oregon law allows licensed concealed carry on campus is largely irrelevant at community colleges where the vast majority of students are under the age of 21 and not legally able to be licensed. That being said, to post the school with signage and electronically as a “GUN FREE ZONE”, you have advertised that it is an area where the probability of armed resistance to an armed attack is low. The likeliness of a legally armed citizen being present would have been greater at a four year university and would be more likely in more pro-second amendment states. Personally, I don’t travel to the west coast or the northeastern states where I can not legally carry.

I read that the campus allows cc of weapons, but weapons aren’t allowed inside buildings. Not sure if accurate.

Once again, a gun-free zone makes it easy for a lunatic to do unbelievable harm.
For those that think a CHL holder can carry on a school property, someone is not reading Oregon law correctly!  Under section 166.370, (3) (g) (A) & (B) it states that a person is not subject to a violation and a class C felony if:
(g) Possession of a firearm on school property if the firearm:
 (A) Is possessed by a person who is not otherwise prohibited from possessing the firearm; and
 (B) Is unloaded and locked in a motor vehicle.
What the hell good is a gun (and a CHL for that matter), if I must keep the gun UNLOADED and locked in my vehicle, which is a 5 – 10 minute walk away?
Lib-tards…. I will never understand them.

From the UCC student Code of Conduct, Under “Student Misconduct”:
Possession or use, without written authorization, of firearms, explosives, dangerous chemicals, substances, or any other weapons or destructive devices that are designed to or readily capable of causing physical injury, on College premises, at College-sponsored or supervised functions or at functions sponsored or participated in by the College.
Sounds like they are banned to me.  What the hell is written authorization?  From whom?  The College, the Mayor, the Governor, my mother?

Are gun laws and campus rules all you can talk about? Yes it’s a problem but no solution exists, not now and certainly not in your near future. What was the gunmans question!!! Stand up and state your religion, this is another brainwashed religious zealot with a gun, laws wouldn’t saved these people.

Liberals create this mess…  with stricter gun laws that only affect law abiding people and has the same effect as more guns in the hands of criminals because less people can protect themselves.  The liberals claim it’s the remaining guns and push for more laws and the cycle continues.  The difference being politicians have armed guards and bullet resistant vehicles.

To the racist that posted “I bet it was black or muslum. Shame On You!!!  I am sure you are shocked , he is white.You wait to see before you accuse. There was a time that you almost always found out it was a white person who did it. Recently it has gotten to the place that you have to wait and see. This is horrible situation, I pray for all the families that are affected. It’s shameful  that you cannot go places with out worrying if you will get shot. God help us!!!
