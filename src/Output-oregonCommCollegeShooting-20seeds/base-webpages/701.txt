A woman is comforted as friends and family wait for students at the local fairgrounds after a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., on Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015.




At least 10 people were killed and seven others were injured when a gunman who demanded to know his victims' religions opened fire Thursday morning on the campus of Umpqua Community College in southwest Oregon, NBC News reported.


A parent of a student who was in the classroom where the shootings occurred told NBC News the gunman asked at least "a few" people what religion they were. The parent asked that they not be identified.




Multiple law enforcement officials told NBC News on Thursday night the gunman's motives weren't clear.


The gunman was killed in a firefight with Douglas County sheriff's deputies, Sheriff John Hanlin said. Multiple law enforcement sources identified him to NBC News as Chris Harper Mercer, 26, but the sheriff wouldn't confirm that identity.

"You will never hear me mention his name," Hanlin said Thursday night, because "he does not deserve it."


Officials have not confirmed if Mercer was included in the 10 killed, and could not confirm his connection to the college.
