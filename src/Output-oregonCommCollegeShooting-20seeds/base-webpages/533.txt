ROSEBURG, Ore. -- With temperatures topping well over 90 degrees Monday, people crowded the Umpqua River.




Families and friends packed picnics and tents to spend a fun day outdoors. They say it's a great way to relax and beat the heat. They also say that the River Forks Park is a popular spot.




Roseburg does not have a city water-park. The city's Park and Recreation says they are working on getting a grant to build one. They want to build a new playground and water spray-park at Fir Grove Park.
