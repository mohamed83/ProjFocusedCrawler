EUGENE, Ore. -- There was a big turnout at Emerald Park Recreation Center in Eugene, all to celebrate fall.




Saturday’s festival was put on by the Oregon State University Lane County Extension Service Master Gardeners.




It offered apple tastings, fresh pressed cider, a plant sale, and multiple classes on different aspects of gardening.


















Community members and master gardeners say it's a fun way to celebrate the season.




There was also a table set up for children to make art out of vegetables.
