FORT MEADE, Md. (AP) -  The FBI has identified a man fatally shot at a National Security Agency  gate after disobeying orders from guards there.




Spokeswoman Amy  Thoreson says the dead man was 27-year-old Ricky Shawatza Hall. His  passenger and an NSA police officer were injured and hospitalized and  have not been identified.


















Thoreson says the two men were dressed as women but "not in an attempt to disguise themselves from authorities."




Authorities  say they had stolen a sport utility vehicle minutes before from a  60-year-old man who had picked them up in Baltimore and brought them to a  Howard County motel to "party."




NSA police officers opened fire on the SUV after the men failed to follow instructions for leaving a restricted area.
