President Obama
 is expected to make a statement soon on 
 at Umpqua Community College that left 13 people dead and more injured.


White House Press Secretary 
Josh Earnest
 
 in reaction to a question about the shooting, reaffirming Obama’s commitment to getting gun control reform done.


UPDATE — 6:45 p.m. ET:
 An incredibly frustrated and fed up Obama spoke for several minutes from the White House Thursday afternoon.


“Anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds regardless of what they think their motivations may be. But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people,” the president said. “We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.”


To those who would accuse him of “politicizing” the tragedy, Obama said, “This is something we should politicize, it is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.”
