This timeline of events in Thursday's mass shooting at Umpqua Community College is based on audio from an emergency dispatch tape recorded during the tragedy. All times listed are approximate.


10:37 a.m.:
 Dispatchers receive a report of shots fired on the Umpqua Community College campus in Roseburg. Initial details are scant, but dispatchers immediately report at least one female shot inside Snyder Hall.


10:42 a.m.:
 Two additional ambulances are requested as police begin arriving on campus.


10:43 a.m.:
 As details emerge, responding officers identify the shooter as a male, and say he is located on the southeast side of the building.


10:44 a.m.:
 Officers report exchanging gunshots with the shooter. Unconfirmed reports from the 9-1-1 dispatch indicate "he's got a long gun." There are reportedly 35 people in Snyder Hall, and the campus is now on lockdown. Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg has been notified to prepare for patients.









10:46 a.m.:
 Officers report "Code 4, suspect is down."


10:48 a.m.:
 "He's not breathing," a 9-1-1 dispatcher reports.


10:49 a.m.:
 The suspect is confirmed dead. "We've got multiple gunshot wounds," one responder tells dispatchers. Dispatchers request multiple ambulances.


10:50 a.m.:
 Responders report more than 20 victims.


10:52 a.m.:
 First reports of deaths come in. At this point, responders say of about 20 victims, "approximately 15" are dead. Multiple medical facilities are placed on alert.


10:53 a.m.:
 Apparently expecting to airlift some patients, someone inside the command center suggests setting up an air zone.


11:09 a.m.:
 All injured victims are headed to hospitals, and additional ambulances headed to Umpqua Community College are told they can respond Code 1, without lights or siren. Responder reports 10 fatalities and six in critical condition headed to Mercy Medical Center.


11:14 a.m.:
 "The hall has been cleared. All clear at Snyder Hall."


11:16 a.m.:
 Wayne Gooch Hall is clear.


11:18 a.m.:
 Science Building is clear.


Between 11:18 and 11:21 a.m.:
 No additional units are needed at UCC. Situation is under control. Scene is Code 4.


11:31 a.m.:
 Two more ambulances requested by incident command. It's not clear if more people were found injured. Witnesses from adjacent classroom identified.


Before 11:36 a.m.:
 "Make sure they know, no one leaves in their own vehicle or anything like that. We need to make sure everyone is patted down and searched before we release them."
