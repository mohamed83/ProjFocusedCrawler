5:20 p.m.
At a press conference at 5:15 p.m. Friday, Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft said shooter John Russell Houser exited the Grand Theatre through a side door after shooting several people.
When he saw a police unit pull into the parking lot, Houser re-entered the theater and fired three more rounds, then a fourth, that took his own life, Craft said.
Fifteen shell casings were recovered in various parts of the theater, he said.
"That was an horrific scene," Col. Mike Edmonson, Louisiana State Police, said.
Houser purchased a 40-caliber semi-automatic handgun at a Phenix City, Alabama, pawn shop in February 2014, Craft said.
It's still unclear why Houser was in Lafayette. Craft said he entered Louisiana around July 2 or 3 and visited various locations up and down the interstate.
"He was out and about. We know he was doing some drinking," Craft said. "He was circulating while he was here."
Houser appears to have visited Lafayette more than once, possibly looking for 'a soft target," he said.
Five people shot by Houser inside the theater remain hospitalized, Craft said. Four have been treated and released.

    Kohl Guilbeau was going to attend an 8:30pm movie at The Grand with his girlfriend but was turned away when police swarmed the area.
    
2 p.m.
Three shooting victims 
 at Lafayette General Medical Center on Friday, but officials said all three are in stable condition and expected to be released in a few days.
The hospital received five patients from the scene of the shooting Thursday night, said David Callecod, president of Lafayette General Health. Three of the patients were transported by ambulance, while two were brought via private vehicle.
Callecod said all five victims had sustained gunshot wounds. Three were classified as Level One trauma patients, while one was a Level Two trauma patient.

Reporter 
 is out on the street talking to Lafayette residents who are shocked and saddened but strongly believe their community will unite in this tragedy.
"It was tragic. Just to stand up and shoot people, he must have had a mental illness. It was horrific," said Leon Simmons. "I'm hurt. We're a very resilient community. We'll get through this, but we'll have to get through the grieving first."
Nurse Ashley Brinkhaus said the shooting was crazy.
"It hurts to the depths of my soul to know this happened in our own backyard," she said. "We raise our kids here."
Resident Alex Thibodeaux had only one thing to say about the suspect.
"(Houser) was a coward," he said.
10:40 a.m.
John Russel Houser, the alleged theater shooter, had been accused of arson and damaging a rental home, had a history of mental illness and was denied a gun permit, according to Russell County, Alabama, Sheriff Heath Taylor.
The Associated Press is reporting that Houser’s wife removed guns from their home in 2008 because of his mental state.
Taylor said Houser was treated at a local mental health facility between 2008 and 2009, but he does not know details.
In 2006, Houser applied for a concealed carry gun permit but was denied because of an arson arrest in Columbus, Georgia, from around 1989 or 1990, Taylor said. He believes the charge was dismissed.
The last known address Taylor has for Houser was the 1100 block of 32nd Street in Phenix City, Alabama.
“We evicted him from that address on March 25, 2014,” he said. “Once we evicted him he apparently did some damage to the property.”
The property owners filed a report claiming Houser damaged a gas line, fireplace and other smaller things, Taylor said.
On Houser’s Linked-In page he identifies himself as an entrepreneur and investment management in Phenix City, Alabama, who attended Faulkner University, a private Christian university in Montgomery, Alabama.
“We’re praying for everybody down there,” he said. “It’s another crazy tragedy that we’re having to deal with. Everybody up here’s keeping y’all in our prayers.”
Houser is also known as Rusty Houser, and apparently has a presence on social media as an outspoken conservative. 
The last thing someone posting as Rusty Houser posted on Facebook was in 2013, when he linked to an article called "A woman's place in the church and the weak church elder," according to KATC-TV.
He wrote, "The bible doesn't ask me to like what it says, only to obey it. Death comes soon to the financially failing filth farm called the US."
He only had two things liked on Facebook, among them "I hate liberals!" 
8:20 a.m.
Lafayette City-Parish President Joey Durel said this morning that this community, recently identified as "the happiest" in the country, will pull together and recover from Thursday night's 
 on Johnson Street.
Three died in the incident, including shooter John Russel Houser, 59, described as a drifter from Alabama who was staying at a hotel on University Boulevard.
 Durel returned to Lafayette this morning from out of state. Police met him at the airport and drove him to the Lafayette Grand, where he joined Gov. Bobby Jindal, Col. Mike Edmonson of the Louisiana State Police and Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft at a news conference.
Speaking to reporters from around the region and country, Durel described Lafayette to them as a "family oriented community" that extends beyond the city's proper borders and across Acadiana, an eight-parish region. 
 8:10 a.m.
Col. Mike Edmonson of the Louisiana State Police said he was at a loss as to why John Russel Houser, 59, the identified shooter at the Grand 16 movie theater in Lafayette, opened fire on patrons around him at 7:30 p.m. Thursday.
"It's easy to speculate," Edmonson said. "Why did he come here? Why did he do that?"
But Edmonson said police were continuing their investigation in the shooting, and motive has not been made clear.
"There are a lot of moving parts to bring together," he said.
8 a.m. 
The identified killer in Thursday night's shooting at the Grand 16 movie theater in Lafayette had apparent plans to shoot, then leave the scene, officials said in a news conference this morning.
John Russel Houser, 59, of Phenix City, Ala., had parked his vehicle, a 1995 Lincoln Continental, near an exit from the theater and was apparently attempted to flee when police arrived at the scene, perhaps within a minute of the shooting. Their quick response forced the gunman back inside the theater, where he took his own life, Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft said.
Craft suggested that the quick response may have saved other lives.
He said very little is known of Houser, and he urged anyone with knowledge of him to contact authorities at 337-291-8650, a line set up to gather information about the shooting. He said authorities believe Houser was operating alone.
Craft said investigators had "worked through the night" at the Johnson Street theater, which he described as "a pretty horrific scene."
They recovered a variety of materials and items, some personal property of people who fled the theater.
 
7:45 a.m.
The shooter in Thursday night's shooting at the Grand 16 Lafayette movie theater has been identified as John Russel Houser, 59, of Alabama, according to Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft.
Craft also identified the deceased victims as 
. Breaux died on the scene and Johnson died at the hospital. Breaux, 21, was from Franklin. Johnson, 33, was from Lafayette.
One victim was still listed in critical condition Friday morning, Craft said. Two victims have been released from the hospital.
Craft described Houser as a "drifter" from Phenix City, Alabama. He had been estranged from his family, he said. Police are still searching for a motive. During a search of Houser's room in Motel 6 on University Avenue, police found wigs and other items that could be used as disguises, Craft said. His car was parked near a theater exit and police believe his intent was to escape after the shooting. Craft said he spotted police approaching him in the theater and decided to take his own life.
An emotional Craft said it's frustrating not knowing the shooter's motive. "Why would you come here and do something like this?" he asked during a news conference Friday morning.
Other updates from overnight:
5:15 a.m.
About a dozen law enforcement personnel were gathered at a Motel 6 in Lafayette early Friday as authorities investigate the shooting that killed three people, including the gunman.
Louisiana State Police spokesman Maj. Doug Cain said the theater investigation led them to a room at the Motel 6. Cain said authorities were investigating whether the shooter had stayed there. He said the bomb squad swept the room before going in as a precaution.
About a dozen police personnel could be seen outside the motel. At one point, an officer carried out a cardboard box from the room and other officers could be seen knocking on neighboring doors.

3:50 a.m.
The White House says President Barack Obama has been briefed on the shooting at a Louisiana movie theater that left three people dead, including the gunman.
Obama was briefed aboard Air Force One on Thursday by Lisa Monaco, his homeland security adviser, while on his way to Africa for a two-nation visit.
Obama asked his team to keep him updated on the investigation and the status of those wounded in the shooting.
He also offered his thoughts and prayers to the community of Lafayette, Louisiana, where the movie theater is located, and to the families of those who were killed.
___
3:30 a.m.
Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft told reporters that nine people in total were wounded in the shooting.
He said at least one of those was in critical condition and being operated on at an area hospital.
"At this point we have three dead, nine wounded and of the three dead one is definitely the shooter," he said.
___
2:30 a.m.
Lafayette Police Chief Jim Craft told reporters that based on the investigation so far, they believe the shooter stood up in the theater, started shooting, and then as people started fleeing, he began to leave as well.
But, investigators believe, he spotted two police officers, who had been out in the parking lot when the shooting happened. The shooter then turned around against the crowd before firing a single shot.
"It looks like he spotted the officers coming in and he turned around and he went against the crowd, and he fired a single gunshot," he said. "He was seated in the theater just like everybody else."
"The information we have at this time indicates that he was by himself, sat by himself and the first two people he shot were sitting right in front of him," Craft said.
