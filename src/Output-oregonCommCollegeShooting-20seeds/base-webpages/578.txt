ROSEBURG, Ore. -- The YMCA in Douglas County received a big check from a local hospital.




Mercy Medical Center gave the YMCA $50,000. The gift goes towards a four million dollar capital campaign to expand the YMCA.




Mercy Medical says they wanted to support the YMCA because it's an important asset to the community. Officials with the YMCA are grateful for their support.


















The update and expansion of the facility will be done in two phases. It includes a new pool, locker room renovation, creating a new north entrance, among many other improvements.




The YMCA serves more than 12,000 community members each year.
