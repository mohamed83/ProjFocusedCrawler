                                            Law enforcement sources have identified 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer as the gunman in a shooting that killed at least 10 at Umpqua Community C...
                                    




Bronte Hart lived below 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer in the community of Winchester. She said Mercer would "sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light."
Hart said a woman she believed to be Mercer's mother also lived upstairs and was "crying her eyes out" Thursday night.
Two law enforcement sources told CBS News Mercer was the man who opened  fire at Umpqua Community College, killing nine people and wounding seven  others. He died after exchanging gunfire with responding officers.

Law enforcement sources also told CBS News four guns -- a combination of pistols and a rifle -- were found at the scene of the shooting.
 Mercer had ties to the Los Angeles-area communities of Torrance and Tarzana.
Mercer's stepsister told the station he was born in England and traveled to the United States as a young boy. She said Mercer's father, who lives in Tarzana, married her mom and that the last time she spoke with Mercer was a year ago.
In Torrance, neighbors told CBS Los Angeles that Mercer lived there a few years ago and kept mostly to himself.

Witness describes deadly barrage



                                            Scott Pelley spoke with Kenneth Ungerman, a UCC student and military veteran, who saw the gunman. Ungerman says it appeared the male shooter had ...
                                    




Posts on an online blog that appears to belong to Mercer reference multiple shootings, including one in Virginia in August that left a television news reporter and cameraman dead. The last upload on the blog was Wednesday. when a documentary about the Newtown shooting was posted.
In one post on the blog about Vester Flanagan, the man who killed the reporter and cameraman in Virginia, Mercer apparently wrote, "I have noticed that so many people like [Flanagan] are alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems like the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight."

Umpqua Community College shooting



                                            A deadly shooting took place on an Oregon community college campus October 1, 2015
                                    




An online dating profile that appears to belong to Mercer lists his hobbies and interests as "Internet, killing zombies, movies, music, reading." Under ethnicity, it says "mixed race" and his relationship status says "single -- never married."
The profile also says he is currently in college and lives with his parents, is a Republican and not religious. It also says he doesn't smoke, drink or do drugs.
One of the groups on the site that he belongs to is called "Doesn't Like Organized Religion."
A witness to the shooting, Kortney Moore, told the Roseburg News-Review newspaper that she was in a writing class when a shot came through a window.
She said the gunman entered her classroom, told people to get on the ground and then asked people to stand up and state their religion before opening fire.
