												Jacob Tyler Roberts: Oregon Mall Shooting Suspect Had ‘Weird Look’ Before Leaving Apartment

			Jacob Tyler Roberts: Oregon Mall Shooting Suspect Had ‘Weird Look’ Before Leaving Apartment					










Jacob Tyler Roberts reportedly had a “weird look” and strange behavior before leaving his home and traveling to a mall, where he opened fire on crowds of people.


Police say Roberts walked out of his apartment wearing a hockey-style mask, hugging the brother of his roommate and telling him he was going “somewhere south, somewhere warm,” 
. The roommate, 26-year-old Jaime Eheler, said Roberts “had a weird look on his face” when he left the house.


 then traveled to a mall in Portland, Oregon, near his apartment and opened fire. He killed Steven Mathew Forsyth, 45, and Cindy Ann Yuille, 54, police said. Kristina Shevchenko, 15, was wounded and in serious condition Thursday.


Police said they still don’t have a motive, but have learned that Roberts had been aimless in the time leading up to the shooting. His aunt said he suffered a foot injury that prevented him from joining the Marines, and after quitting his job at a gyro shop he had reportedly planned to move to Hawaii. Roberts even sold his possessions and car on Craigslist.


Roberts’ ex-girlfriend, Hannah Patricia Sansburn, told ABC’s 
World News with Diane Sawyer
 that he was ready to go, but got drunk and missed a flight


Still, Sansburn said she does not hold hatred for Roberts, 
. She and other expressed desire to know more about motives, which will forever go unknown as Roberts turned the gun on himself.


“I hate him for what he did, but I can’t hate the person I knew because it was nothing like the person who would go into a mall and go on a rampage,” she said of Jacob Tyler Roberts.
