PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Three orphaned cougar cubs have taken up temporary residence at the Oregon Zoo's veterinary medical center.




The 10-day-old cubs were rescued by wildlife officials in Washington state last week. It's unclear where they were found, or what happened to their mother.




Because cubs can't survive in the wild on their own, they were sent to Portland's zoo.


















They arrived weighing just a pound and a half each, eyes barely open. Zoo officials say the cubs are very vocal, especially at bottle feeding time.




In a week or two, the cubs will move to a permanent home - likely another zoo. Most cougars currently in U.S. zoos are orphans.




Also known as mountain lions, cougars are native to the American West. They face the challenges of human encroachment and habitat destruction.
