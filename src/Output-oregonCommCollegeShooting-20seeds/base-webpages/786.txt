“Vester was an unhappy man. We employed him as a reporter and he had some talent in that respect and some experience,” WDBJ General Manager Jeff Marks said, according to Buzzfeed “He quickly gathered a reputation of someone who was difficult to work with. He was sort of looking out to people to say things he could take offense to. Eventually, after many incidents of his anger, we dismissed him. He did not take that well. We had to call police to escort him from the building.”

I’m not sure you have the picture of the right person. Apparently his name is Bryce WIlliams and he filmed himself doing it the bastard. Twitter removed his account with hte video thankfully but I think you have the wrong persons picture up

Bryce was his on screen name so the account probably was his. And really no need to be a jerk.

You need to reread the article, that is the right person. This person felt cornered…. after reading more into this…he complained of racism and nothing was done. It the victims both were dating within the company. They had the support of the producers. It sounds like a very tense environment, that got out of hand. And this man lost it.

Studies are needed….and no one should be given a pass for their race OR THEIR RACISM!….Murder is murder no matter the cause!…..punish accordingly……and BTW, on guns….both sides of a gang fight have ’em, people still die big time….Lincoln County NM, 1885, cattle wars…same thing!….OK corral, same thing!…..The only person who needs a gun is the person who carries one!….Have a nice day!

People as a whole need to start working things out with each other and caring maybe a little more about the future of our world, our children are the future and as generations have come and gone as they will,do we really not find a way to a better solution? I myself grew up in chaos and got lucky to not be dead yet,NorthEast Richmond easter hill projects ‘ the hood 4 rrreal richtown,ehp no joke sidewalk candlelight visual & retaliation-not too many venture out for casual walks. It was real bad and i noticed all got killed out of eather money power but mainly fear, turf.Sorry in my mind its commen people die but more really actually killed by another and this guy Bryce came from a strong educated family, didnt he have folks to say watchin out for him you know be sure his mental state was not just ok but good aah i aint know that guys life so. It seemed unnecesarry, like i said i dont know his life I stop judging.I hope the future is better, hell man psycho every year now it seems kills a school of kids somewhere i wish america cared more. What happened to honor, family value and notice of others in need of help yes strangers you dont know, dont let you or yours live fear,caution is different.Be aware of all you are in always,be educated. Conquer fear with a passion cause its the real evil.Money just a disease spread one hand to another metaphorically and literally.Knowledge and honor need to spread out more I notice..god bless USA
