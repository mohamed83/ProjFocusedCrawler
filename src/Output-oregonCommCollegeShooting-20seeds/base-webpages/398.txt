2. He Told ABC He Was Inspired by the Charleston Church Shooting & Was a ‘Powder Keg’


Flanagan went by Bryce Williams while on the air for WDBJ.


On his Twitter account, he said Parker made racist comments. He also said Adam Ward went to human resources on him.


a 23-page fax from someone named Bryce Williams after the shooting. ABC said it has shared the fax with police, and posted some of its contents Wednesday afternoon. The fax came about two hours after the shooting. He also called ABC twice in the hours after the shooting.


In the fax, Flanagan wrote, “Why did I do it? I put down a deposit for a gun on 6/19/15. The Church shooting in Charleston happened on 6/17/15 … What sent me over the top was the church shooting. And my hollow point bullets have the victims’ initials on them.”


He also referenced Virginia Tech shooter Seuing Hui Choi, calling him “his boy,” and expressed admiration for the Columbine High School shooters.


Flanagan wrote that he suffered racial discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying at work, because he was a gay black man.

(Twitter)


Flanagan, often using the on-air name Bryce Williams, has worked at several news stations around the country,


He worked at WDBJ from March 2012 to February 2013.


“Vester was an unhappy man. We employed him as a reporter and he had some talent in that respect and some experience,” WDBJ General Manager Jeff Marks said on the air. “He quickly gathered a reputation of someone who was difficult to work with. He was sort of looking out to people to say things he could take offense to. Eventually, after many incidents of his anger, we dismissed him. He did not take that well. We had to call police to escort him from the building.”


Reporter Joce Sterman of WJLA obtained documents from the lawsuit Flanagan filed against WDBJ after his filing:






Flanagan was written up by WDBJ in '12 for several incidents where employees felt threatened, was REQUIRED to contact Health Advocate @ work

His former boss at WTWC, in San Diego, Don Shafer, 
about Flanagan, saying he was “a good on-air performer, a pretty good reporter,” but “things started getting a little strange.” Shafer hired Flanagan in 2000 and also fired him for “odd behavior” the same year.


“I know that there were some issues with him and his personality that kind of (spiraled) down, and that’s why we had to get rid of him,” Shafer told San Diego 6, adding that Flanagan got into arguments with co-workers. “I don’t want to say anything more about that, but … I didn’t see (a dangerous aspect) in his personality.”


Adam Ward, a 27-year-old cameraman at WDBJ-TV, was killed along with reporter Alison Parker during a shooting on live TV in Moneta, Virginia.

Actually, I don’t think shooting your self and others in broad daylight on a live newscast is the sign of a coward afraid to face his own actions , something I could easily admit to being too cowardly to do to myself or other people because I feel it is simply wrong. but this man thought he was in the right.he was obviously a man with dysfunctional and conflicting moral opinions.all thoughts and opinions begin in the brain. Society has a mental health issue that it needs to address on all levels.addressing mental health care can and will save lives. this is an issue that affects everyone on this planet.anyone can be a victim of mental illness or somebody who is mentally ill. it’s something we cannot run from and we need to have enough pride to face this issue.it would be an embarrassment if we turn our heads away from a mental health crisis.how many people have to die before society realizes it’s becoming a victim of its own circumstances.it will not solve every problem but will make the world a better place ,having the biggest effects on violent crimes and tragedy .it will also massively reduce homelessness,drug addiction,and will also help with environmental issues such as pollution.if it can affect all of these things it can  obviously affect our economy also. education and health care are the basic needs for a society to solve its own problems.smarter healthier people make better decisions. point being made now I must ask everyone to join together and push for your community to develop mental health services that will provide for those in need……I love my country, please help our mothers, fathers ,sons and daughters.

Your a fucking idiot, blacks can exhibit prejudice which is the act of disliking a person based on their color, actions, and character but racism you fucking dick head involves a social and economic system that intentionally discriminates against a certain class or race within those systems.  Preventing them from equal opportunities like housing,  education,  fair employment,  not to mention a criminal justice system that unjustly discriminate based on color. So it’s a fact black can not be racist.  Do some research bitch.

Isn’t the president black? I bet he has a nice house. That job sounds like it would take some kind of education. I’m not sure about his criminal history. There are a lot of black leaders, business owners, and soldiers in this country who made it. Seems to me that the only thing holding back black folk is this kind of thinking.

The problem is lack of education  ( disruption of class, interfering with others learning, no educational home support, lack value of education, etc) and the fact managers hire the most qualified to work, when giving 100% is not cool in job it is then someone elses fault when black people are not promoted as in many cases they are not most qualified. Also the fact that indiscretions or crimes committed by blacks are supposed to be overlooked cause of whatever whine this week. So to all reading and whinning who are black in school you cared solely about education you treated everyone with the same respect and you did your homework ,class assignments ,and gave school your complete attention. Well look at the successful black men and women that is what they did, I cant help the fact you fucked yourself and now want a handout. Handouts are given in prison for those to week minded to do what they are supposed to do to succeed

So your saying that it’s impossible for a black person to be racist?  What about rich black community?  Could they be racist if such a place existed?  Or are you saying that it’s impossible for blacks to create a system that would foster these conditions?  You know what that sounds like to me?  The kind of definition you would hear from a racist black organization.  You make yourself appear to be ignorant when you make such dumb statements.  Can a poor white man be racist?  Can a Asian American be racist?   Yes black people can be racist.  I can provide you with examples if you would like.  You Racist.

Blacks can be raciest.   You think that blacks are screwed because of housing and employment opportunities then I am guessing you have never meet an American Indian.  Blacks are sometimes more raciest than a lot of whites because they think they are owed something they have never earned.  Racisim exist in every race and ignorance apparently does as well

“Flanagan” Note to Heavy.com, how do you expect people to take you seriously when you can’t even spell the last name of the suspect? It’s “Flanigan” not “Flanifgan” or “Flanagan” or other variants that you attempted to spell his name in the link.  Not sure if you’re doing that for tags or whatever but when you’re title is misspelled, it makes you article (albeit as well-researched as it appeas) simply look unprofessional.

I guess in your little world, God is probably at the wheel and you feel no accountability or responsibilty for your actions… but in the real world, actions have consequences and if those consequences happen to get you killed, then you should have made better choices.




 












 
Fred
 
says:
 












The problem with your logic is that you have assumed the murderer to be truthful.   How do you know if the victims did anything to the murderer?   Because the murderer said so, then killed himself so he wouldn’t have to actually explain himself?   Based on what you’ve written, any one of us could take offense to anything anybody else does and kill them for it, and in your eyes it is justified.   We should have known better, right?   That is just bizarre — you may need some psychological help.  Being accountable for ones actions does not mean getting shot for saying something offensive — even if that were proven true, which it hasn’t.   


I’ve run into these types of “victims” before although they weren’t killers.  They are people — black, white, male and female — who are offended at the slightest perceived transgression against them.  And it seems like there are more and more of them out there.  They never recognize, or want to even think about, their own role in how things are going.  It’s always someone else’s fault.  


The more I think about it, you come across like one of them.

Thanks, Fred. Do I seem offended by any of this to you? Think I’m going to lose any sleep over anything that happened today? I completely agree with you though. Everyone has thinner and thinner skin and less and less sense of blame these days. Think I’m going to complain if someone decides to shoot me for anything I’ve said here tonight? I’ll be the last one to know I’m about to die so what do I care. I have been polite to everyone that has shared their thoughts with me, including complete strangers wishing me dead… You people need help, not me. I’m perfectly content with who I am, where I am and whatever happens next. I’m just here for the ride while it lasts.

Are you going to try and convince me that before today, none of these people ever treated another person like shit? Because you’d have a hard time convincing me that these were innocent little angels that don’t have anything in common with the rest of society these days. I openly admit to being just as much of an asshole and I’d know exactly why something like this happened to me and what I did to provoke it. Whatever will be, will be.

It’s more than a little disingenuous for the people of this country to bawl over something like this one day and praise the slaughter of men, women and children all over the rest of the world the next. I simply don’t care what anyone’s justification for being appalled at this is because most of those same people don’t give a second thought to the other 150,000 people a day that die or the 1.5 million people a year that are victims of everyday violence in this country. There is nothing that sets this event apart from every other besides the fact that it happened on tv.

I agree with the neutral basis of your first comment, but not some of your opinion statements. We have no objective way to judge whether this was justified or not, other than the lines we draw ourselves. Maybe they were all assholes and racists, but one of them just happened to be a murderer as well. I’m atheist, and I don’t think being a racist asshole is a justification for murder being “what is coming to them.” By your own logic, you’re an asshole who could justifiably kill someone in the middle of the street who is racist or an simply an asshole to you because “what will be, will be.” Right and wrong is real. It is set by a society that has overwhelmingly disagreed you. If you truly believe there is no tragedy here, your sense of objectivity and morality as skewed as the killer’s due to your cynicism. Or you could just be a sensationalist asshole in diction. A tactless drama queen/king. Those are somebody’s sons and daughters, douchebag.

I appreciate the logical argument, CR and in general I agree with your point. I’m not some kind of monster. I simply am who America made me. A husband, a father, a soldier and a citizen. I don’t go around seeing how far people will let themselves be pushed. I am just as callous and careless around people I’m comfortable with, if not more so, than the next person. But I treat strangers with some level of dignity and respect. 


Sure, my comments and assumptions are based on the evidence presented but this didn’t occur in a vacuum. This psycho didn’t lash out at complete strangers. These two people wounded him, by word or by action, in fact or inside his own head. It happens all the time and people think they are blameless victims when someone eventually reacts to them in a negative way. I don’t believe anyone is “innocent”, myself included. If I hurt someone deeply enough for them to come after me for it, then so be it. Strangers I did NOTHING to already seem to want to take a shot so let them step up and let life run its course.

The title labeled him as a Jehovah’s Witness but the text clearly said he was just raised as one. Most readers here understand that a person “raised” in any religion is not that religion. If they were that religion then they normally say I am xxx not raised. So don’t get so uppity about your religion being so different.

It’s not that difficult to feel this man felt some people were racist toward him but his actions and his comments reveal him to be the same type racist as the Charleston Church shooter who somehow also felt vindicated by his senseless and horrible shooting.  This man’s own video camera reveals he stood there for a few moments knowing his victims never knew he was there or giving them a chance.  He is just as evil and just as racist as the Charleston Shooter and Racism knows no color, race or person and affects all.

Turn to God while today is called today, seek peace and pursue it; for the eyes of the LORD are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry, but the face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the rememberance of them from the land.

Why not call it a racist motivated crime. Commited by an Angry Black Man, who blinsided innocent white people. Just another day. Liberals say Its the gun’s fault. Outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns. I suggest arm yourself and don’t be a victim.

ATTENTION:

•	The ONLY reason this is in the media is because the suspect is a young African American man.

•	If he were a white dude, you never would have heard about this. Typical in America, the white man trying to keep down the Black man. Disgusting.

•	This is OBVIOUSLY the station’s fault. Mr Vester L. Flanigan recently filed a racial discrimination lawsuit against them which he aloso did at his last 3 jobs.

•	They obviously hate Blacks at WDBJ.

•	Thank heavens the police officers that pulled Mr Vester L. Flanigan over didn’t shoot him dead. He killed himself because of them.

•	BLACK LIVES MATTER.

Last year over 300000+ white people were victims of black violence.  I feel sorry for you blackies because when we actually wake up and decide we aren’t going to take it anymore, I am going to buy you for $100 and take some hot black (with Caucasian features, I am not into beastiality) women as my fuck bitch.

That is the most bull I have ever heard. Racism exists because of people like you. The race card always pulled. The people behind the triggers of any crime of murder are mentally disturbed. America needs to get beyond the race card. What happened in history has nothing to do with the white people living now. I wish people would grow up and get out of the box that holds them captive in something is long and gone. Stop the hate!

Fuck anyone that supports what this guy did.  If you have a beef, bring it to the person you have a beef with.  If you take a gun to an unarmed person and shoot them, you are the definitive PUSSY.  Be a man and fight, or at least say “I am going to shoot you.”  This country is a bunch of goddamn pussies.

He looks to me like he may have been a lifelong weightlifter, he looks thick and strong and in some of these pictures and sports a definite “V” which suggests to me the possible use of steroids. Steroids distort perception of human interaction and definitely alter and intensify aggression as well as size. Not saying to blame the roids if this is the case, but if so, may be a contributing factor. It will be interesting to see toxicology reports.

Most ppl in here are talking abt being black or white. But at the end of the day we are all working our butt off to feed our family. Those person were working not stealing or killing. They were just working! Flanagan wanted justice in his way. Wats the point to kill two inocent then killing urself? 3 family suffering and people hating each other more because of their skin color… why dont we just stand together to fight against discrimination at work and fight to re enforced safety for us and our kids.

Regardless of color, religion, gender or sexual preference, two innocent lives were taken. Racist and ignorant comments like the ones I read on this comment section is what tick these sick individuals off. All lives matter. This was a senseless and cruel planned murder. How about saying a prayer for the victims families, instead of posting negative useless comments.

He was a black man that shot 3 white people because black men bullied him because he was gay. This was not because of race, he was crazy. I know his excuse was more in-depth than my summary but bottom line he was a sick deranged person looking for a reason to shoot someone. There is no reason for all the hate. You are giving the shooter what he wanted. Respect the victims and love one another. In the end love will win.

I’ve lived in SW Virginia.  I am an African American professional and US Army Veteran.  I’m not presuming to know who is right or wrong in this tragic situation.  What I can say is that this part of Virginia is a very difficult place to work as a minority.  Good Old Boy  network alive and well,  the work place politics, the intolerance for anything different or not the norm.  Having boundaries and standing up for yourself is perceived as “intimidating and unapproachable ” racism runs rampant. …I mean you’re OK as long as you know your place.  God forbid if you’re better educated,  world traveled,  eloquent and easy going.  They will chew you up and spit you out.  I’ve had an excellent work life. ….everywhere but SW Virginia.  It was a nightmare. For many,  many people I know.  I’m not condoning the behavior of this murderer but I think that it is already obvious by the verbage being used in these headlines that he is being portrayed in a way that is extremely inflammatory and I understand the environment that drove him there.  You cant play with people’s lives for kicks and office politics.  Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.  Sadly in SW Virginia,  they think only certain people deserve that consideration.  Horrible state to work in if you’re black and not from there.  Sad.

this has false flag event all over it…time stamps incorrect on publishing, video doesn’t show anyone being shot either. smells like political propaganda being force fed to the public as a real news story. Think the US isn’t allowed to do that by law? Think again! Look: 
  This means the US govt. can present the public news that is not factual or a blatant lie and it is legal to do so. Better check this shit out first for propaganda, it certainly isn’t news, or even real! You’ll see when the go fund me’s begin to make money.

Having watched the video from the shootists perspective i find it odd that she manages to run away having been shot about 3 or 4 times when he says he was using hollow points.

“What sent me over the top was the church shooting. And my hollow point bullets have the victims’ initials on them.”

This is the most convincing piece of evidence that these shootings did not really take place. Hollow point bullets. If Flanagan used hollow points, they would have ripped Alison Parker to pieces, yet after 2/3 shots, she turned and fled. No wounds. No blood. Nothing.


Any deniers care to explain that one?

Hollow Points are not instant kill machines.  Someone getting shot be several and still running away is not uncommon… it just depends where they hit.  If someone is telling you getting shot by a hollow point will drop someone fast no matter what, they are lying to you.
