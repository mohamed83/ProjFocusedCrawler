												Did 4chan Post Predict Oregon College Shooting? Umpqua Community College Shooter May Have Left Warning

			Did 4chan Post Predict Oregon College Shooting? Umpqua Community College Shooter May Have Left Warning					










A 4chan post may have predicted the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon, with a post early on Thursday that appeared to be from the shooter giving a warning about the attack.


The shooting took place at the western Oregon college campus on Thursday morning, with reports that as many as 15 people were killed in a mass shooting. Police said they have detained the shooting suspect and that the danger to students is over, but the death toll from the attack has continued to rise.


At least 7 killed and 20 hurt, shooter ‘down’ and in custody.

— Los Angeles Times (@latimes) 


Now it appears that the Oregon community college shooter may have left an ominous warning. A posting from the image-sharing site 4chan appeared to predict Thursday’s Oregon college shooting.




The post reads as follows.


“Some of you guys are alright. Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest.


happening thread will be posted tomorrow morning


so long space robots”


The nature of 4chan is fluid and threads are not archived, but a screenshot of the 4chan posting was 
, showing the exchange in its entirety.


Some of the users on 4chan also appeared to egg on the person, though they may not have known if the threat was legitimate.


“I suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire.


Make sure that there is no way that someone can disarm you as it is possible. I suggest you carry a knife on your belt as last resort if someone is holding your gun.”


The person also promised to give more updates.


“Willl post again in am, 10 min countdown. Won’t say much more to prepare.”


If true, this would not be the first time that someone has left evidence of their crime on 4chan. In November, a man identified as 
 allegedly posted a picture of a dead and half-naked woman along with a confession that he had murdered her.


“Turns out it’s way harder to strangle someone to death than it looks in the movies,” the first post read.


Though some doubted the authenticity, police in Port Orchard, Washington, later confirmed that the details fit a recent homicide. 
The
 
 reported that police found the body of a woman in her early 30s who matched the pictures seen on 4chan.


“It’s a suspicious death and appears to be a homicide,” Sheriff’s Office spokesman Scott Wilson said.


Kalac also stole the woman’s vehicle, and appeared to promise more bloodshed.

“I bought a BB gun that looks realistic enough,” the user wrote. “When they come, I’ll pull it and it will be suicide by cop. I understand the doubts. Just check the f****** news. I have to lose my phone now.”


But Kalac was ultimately arrested without incident and charged in the woman’s murder.


The 4chan post that seemed to predict the Oregon community college shooting was shared on Reddit on Thursday afternoon, where it attracted hundreds of user upvotes. Some called out the users who seemed to egg the shooter on, but others noted that there was likely no way of stopping the massacre.


“This is what a lot of people fail to recognize with internet hate,” one user wrote. “People have been crying for attention for a long time, with thinly veiled threats of suicide and homicide. There’s no point coddling and negotiating with these types because the real psychopaths will just see reward in making more threats.”


There is no confirmation yet whether the 4chan post that appeared to predict the Oregon community college shooting is legitimate. Police said the suspect has been neutralized, but they have not yet said if the person is alive or dead.
