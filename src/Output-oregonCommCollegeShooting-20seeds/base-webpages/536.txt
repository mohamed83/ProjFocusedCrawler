PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Oregon officials have prohibited fishing or curtailed fishing hours on most rivers in the state to avoid additional stress on wild fish suffering from drought-related high water temperatures and low stream flows.




The state's Department of Fish and Wildlife says angling for trout, salmon, steelhead and sturgeon will be prohibited at all times in the Willamette River downstream of Willamette Falls, on a section of the Clackamas River and several sections of the John Day River.




And fishing won't be allowed from 2 p.m. to one hour before sunrise on most other rivers. The closures are effective Saturday.


















Fishing hours will remain unchanged at a few spots, such as on some sections of the Wallowa, Malheur and Klamath rivers.
