"The material world is a lie. For so long we have been taught that what's important in life is to buy this and have that. To always have the latest fashion, biggest tv, fanciest car, nicest house, and blah,blah, blah. Well, the truth is we've become so attached to these things, our spiritual development has been halted. Just like they say in fight club "We become owned by the things we own". Most people will spend hours standing in front of stores just to buy a new iphone. Those same people will complain about how they don't have enough money but will always have money to spend on apple products. This attachment produces so much of the stress and worrying in the world today. I used to be like that, always concerned about what clothes I had, rather than whether or not I was happy. But not anymore. Since then I have learned the truth that such attachments are falsehoods and will only bring misery.This is my first blog post, there will be more to come."

what can u say? It’s just unAmerikan to want to stop peeps carrying guns to klass. Just unAmerikan. Free, brave peeps need to carry a gun, even to the john. Only tyrants want to stop Amerikans being Amerikans.

“Seems the more people you kill, the more your’re in the limelight.” Guess heavy et al. are confirming the murderer’s observation.
