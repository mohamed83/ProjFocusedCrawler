Democrat controlled Detroit ‚Äî 569 shootings as of June 21.

Democrat controlled Milwaukie ‚Äî 4th highest murder rate in the USA, totally incongruent with the population


Nuff said?? Rose, you should really educate yourself on which is the party of hate. To say that Democrats and Progressives are ‚Äútolerant‚Äù is truly an oxymoron.

:) Russian ‚Äù friends ‚Äù  ???  hahahaha


Now , I need to ask this question I have asked after the last rampage just a few weeks ago . Why is America  the only nation on earth that this keeps happening  in ??  I was answered mainly  by this answer or some answer that means it , The constitution granted Americans the right to carry guns !!!!  I agree to that WHEN the constitution was declared  a few hundred years back . But why NOW ?? Why does the constitution give you the right to kill each other ? Is this deep within the American culture ?? If there is such a thing ??  




 












 
 
says:
 












This keeps happening in america because americans keep electing leaders who seek to disarm the people like the Nazis did in Germany. As long as the political leaders in america desire to disarm Americans, these sort of events will be in the news. Why? Because these sort of tactics have shown most effective in achieving political goals I‚Äôm american culture. So, again, as long as our politicians desire to disarm us, they will continue to make scenes just like this one happen in hopes of swaying our votes‚Ä¶




 












 
osiris61
 
says:
 












Why do you WANT arms on you in the first place ? That‚Äôs the question , it‚Äôs NOT about the leaders  which I see that they have all good points ad cause about that issue . Why do YOU , American citizens , need / want/ like/ love to carry arms ? What makes Americans think that way ?? That‚Äôs my question .

You dumb ass.  Try to harm me, my family, or my property and I‚Äôll blow your ass off!  That‚Äôs what guns are for!

Who would try to harm YOU , your family or your property ?? which happens every where ‚Ä¶ Why DO YOU AMERICANS want to carry arms ?  And what you are saying , with all the proper language that you are using is actually proving that you are no better nor less sick  than that shooter , only  waiting for a chance to use your gun ‚Ä¶ Now can you please answer my question ??  Carry guns and defend yourselves against WHOM exactly ?




 
















 
 
says:
 












Because it is the only means of defense that we truly have to secure our rights remain intact. Renegade and tyrannical politicians enacting laws for over 2 centuries which are contrary to our fundamental rights as creatures of the earth; as living and breathing souls and then hiring bully pigs in batman costumes with low IQ‚Äôs to wield guns and full body armor to enforce these laws on us with violence, these unnatural atrocities which trample our rights as human beings much less ‚Äúcitizens of a free country‚Äù. Through legislation and militarization the enemy (corporate government) has long since over stepped its limited authority and proven that this ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù concept only works when the rulers making the unethical laws have the bigger stick than the ‚Äúsubjects‚Äù they desire to rule over. Retaining our sticks at all costs is the only measure we as a nation of people have managed to accomplish in protecting each of our families and communities to being victim to hostile takeover by totalitarian regime. Granted the ice between what we have in this day and age and totalitarian regime is razor thin, that ice is intact solely because to this day we as a nation have managed to hold on to our sticks. If we give up our sticks we as an entire congregation of souls will become totally defenseless prey to the will of totalitarian tyrants.

Right the people who were present who could have put a swift end to the fiasco were directed by school staff to stay the fuck out of it‚Ä¶ Why? Because this was a coordinated and orchestrated/planned covert exercise of which school staff were already aware of being scheduled to take place. Sounds like a haughty accusation but actually this scenario is a bit played the fuck out already. Pretty much every shooting event which has made the national news in the last couple decades has been based on this exact scenario so like I said, this tactic is beyond played out.

Are y‚Äôall fucking kidding me? Is this some no debate, no discourse, no respect ‚Äî not to mention, meaningless ‚Äî kind of forum? Many of you are caring too much as to whether he is black or white, republican or democrat, potato or pahtato‚Ä¶ Maybe, look at what just happened today with a more intellectual and less ‚Äúzombie‚Äù-like sort of quizzicality. Something terrible happened today, and this is how you all respond? How embarrassing. How pathetic.

If all he has is a MySpace acct then all that info is at least 8 yrs old. He‚Äôs probably a Muslim convert. He doesn‚Äôt drink, no tattoos, shaved head, no expression on his face, and shoots Christians execution style for being Gods children. Tell me this isn‚Äôt Islam related and I‚Äôll show you a moron.

This is a bunch of bs‚Ä¶ Again and again this renegade government kills more innocents in an attempt to massively trample rights of we the peasants‚Ä¶ Obama getting on TV and putting on his best Hollywood scene talking about ‚Äúamericans are desensitized‚Äù to such tragedies‚Ä¶ Oh really? Tell me Mr president, when was the last time you took a cyber trip over to killedbypolice.net and took a good look at the atrocious information contained there?? Notice how these are the statistics reported on and doesn‚Äôt include a full record of killings‚Ä¶ So where‚Äôs the outrage on that, Mr president?


There are a tremendous number of holes in this story, so many that I think maybe the orchestrators of this false flag event are trying to bank on the sales of recreational marijuana more than consistency of information and believable facts for getting the locals to buy this buncha bs.

A conservative republican californian from los angelas CALIFORNIA goes to the redneck town of roseburg, armed with a gun unto the community college and into a specific class all where no one knows him and starts shifting people for having any form of religion‚Ä¶ Really? And of course, no one knows who this guy is, takes all day to put a name on it, still don‚Äôt know what gun was used or how the shootout with local pigs goes‚Ä¶ Sounds like another one of them training exercises with security releases/contracts involved with everyone who was their. Let me guess, top secret training operation? Please, the number and amount of leaks to be expected from ROSEBURG‚Ä¶ And everyone‚Äôs hush hush. Really. In roseburg. Must be very powerful somebodies responsible for such silence, as usual. No. I don‚Äôt know if anyone is actually hurt, if anyone is actually dead because of this, our renegade tyrannical government has proven on my occasions to date that they are fully prepared to extinguish the lives of we the peasants without remorse in any attempt to achieve their political agenda/goals. Look at 9/11, look at killedbypolice.net these tyrants have no qualms with butchering we the peasants to accomplish their political goals‚Ä¶

 I wonder why these jackasses are always shooting up ‚Äúgun free zone‚Äù schools. Is it because they are bullies going after the fish in the barrel?? I‚Äôm sure. Whichever route to creating the most fear and outrage is the route they usually take. This garbage has false flag, government sci op written all over it.

Very odd, it‚Äôs almost like a fake Facebook page for him. Just seems to be to many contradictory things, like saying he‚Äôs a republican but posting about the IRA. Or saying he‚Äôs into meditation and spirituality but then he did this and went after one religion. I think we will find out he was mentally ill and he might have been cunning enough to change his information to attain a political end. Or the conspiracy theory that he was Muslim or government pawn who was used to push politics‚Ä¶.like Obama said ‚Äúwe need to politicize this‚Äù‚Ä¶
