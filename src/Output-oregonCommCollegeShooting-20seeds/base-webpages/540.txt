Roseburg, Ore.--In the wake of the deadly shooting at Umpqua Community College, the blood drive venue for tomorrow has been moved to the Community Education building on 2549 NW Stewart Parkway in Roseburg. The building is located across the street from McDonalds.




Blood donations will be taken from 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.




Anyone who would like to donate blood will need to register on the second floor of the building.


















After registering donors will be brought out to the mobile donation center.




The center is in need of O-positive and O-negative blood, but they are asking anyone who’s available to donate.




The blood drive was formerly set to take place at the Mercy Medical Center.
