ROSEBURG, Ore. — As people mourned the victims and comforted the survivors, investigators on Friday tried to piece together why a gunman went on a shooting rampage at a community college here in rural southern Oregon.
The 
 on Thursday morning, by a 26-year-old man identified as 
, left 10 people dead and seven wounded. Law enforcement officials said he had three weapons, at least one of which was a long gun, and that the others were believed to be handguns.
On Friday morning, John Hanlin, the Douglas County sheriff, told CNN that investigators had spent the night trying to reach neighbors and acquaintances of the gunman, and that they were still processing evidence from the crime scene.
Law enforcement officials said one witness had told them that the gunman, Mr. Mercer, had asked about people’s religions before he began firing. “He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,” one law enforcement official said.

Investigators are also poring over what one official described as “hateful” writings by Mr. Mercer.
But Sheriff Hanlin voiced caution. “It is really too early to tell what the motive was,” he said. “We hope to get to the bottom of that in the next couple of days.”
Umpqua Community College remained closed on Friday and said it would not reopen until Monday. “Right now, it is a crime scene,” Rita Cavin, the interim president of the college, said.

Hours after the shooting, several hundred people gathered at dusk for a candlelight vigil at Stewart Park here, about eight miles south of the college. Amid singing, bagpipe playing and prayers, college students and others tearfully mourned the dead. Speakers included Gov. Kate Brown. Candles and boxes of tissue lay scattered on the grass.
“We know this is not going to be our defining moment,” John Blackwood, a computer science teacher at Umpqua Community College, said in a brief speech. “We’re going to go back to school Monday. We will not be terrorized, and we will not be intimidated by these types of people.”
Fighting back tears, the Roseburg city manager, Lance Colley, said: “It’s been the worst day of everybody’s life in the community. We’re not used to tragedies.”

“Somehow this has become routine,” Mr. Obama said. “I’d ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save these lives and let these people grow up.”

Tactical teams and bomb technicians had cleared all the buildings on campus by late Thursday, and were working to clear the hundreds of vehicles still parked on campus, Sheriff Hanlin said. Teams from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oregon State Police were collecting evidence from the crime scene.
Speaking about the gunman, Sheriff Hanlin asked that people avoid “any glorification and sensationalization of him.”

“I don’t want to glorify the shooter,” he said. “I don’t want to glorify his name. I don’t want to glorify his cause.”
Officers with the Department of Homeland Security arrivedThursday night at a dun-colored apartment complex here near the college, where Mr. Mercer was reported to have lived. The authorities had cordoned off the building, and three neighbors said they recognized photographs of the gunman.
Federal law enforcement officials said they were examining an online conversation on 4chan, an anonymous message board, as well as on other social media, to determine whether any of it was linked to the gunman. In that conversation, one writer said, “Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the Northwest.”

Roseburg, with a population of 22,000 and about 180 miles south of Portland, is a part of the Pacific Northwest that in many ways has been left behind while the region has moved toward an economy of technology and high wages. Once a major center for wood milling, it has struggled in recent decades as the timber harvests in the national forests that hug the community have declined.
Grape cultivation for wine has helped somewhat, but poverty and unemployment rates are high. In August, according to the most recent government figures, Douglas County had an 
 of 8.1 percent, tied for the second-highest in the state. About 20 percent of residents in the city and county live below the federal poverty line.
Umpqua Community College, which has about 3,000 students, reflects that struggle, with many of its students coming back to school to gain skills for a career change. The average student is 37, and popular courses of study include winemaking, nursing, welding and auto mechanics.

“It’s a community college, so a lot of our friends and family attend this college,” Sheriff Hanlin said.
The issue of gun control has recently roiled Oregon. This year, state legislators passed a law closing a loophole for background checks on private gun sales, after years of trying to win support for it.
Sheriff Hanlin had forcefully lobbied against gun control after previous school shootings, but on Friday he told CNN that now was not the time to discuss gun control.
“We want to focus on completing this investigation, doing a thorough investigation,” he said. “And more importantly we want to focus on the families of the victims.”
