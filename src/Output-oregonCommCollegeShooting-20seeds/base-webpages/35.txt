Media Mistake?
 
says:
 












Sorry for the families loss. Wacko’s like this make it hard on honest and legitmate gun ownership. I am just wondering if the media has jumped to a conclusion on the long gun used? It automatically becomes an AR type assualt rifle. I hate to burst their bubble, but if it was the rifle that he has pictured used in this tragedy, it is not an AR type assault rifle. That is a Ruger 10/22 in which is intended for sporting/hunting purposes. I have used one since I was 11 years old to bag squirrels with to eat. If they are going to be banned by the gun control advocates as being an assault weapon, good luck. There has been over 5 million manufactured and 99.9% are owned and used legally. Condolences to the families once again.

Unless the honest gun owners (and I am one of them) sytand up and demand a little bit of sanity regarding gun purchases and transfers, the day will come when we will face significant hurdles to owning guns. and that day isn’t too far away now.

This 1 event has garnered national media news in a matter of moments and yet in Chicago which is a gun free city or atleast supposed to be has had 50 gun murders again this past weekend with the peeps being people who like Obama coined the term could have been Obama’s son. That’s a huge story that proves that gun laws , rules , codes , and making guns illegal serves only one purpose and that is to make the victims defenseless because like we see in Chicago no matter what laws are in place criminals will always find ways to obtain guns. There is no coincidence that cities with the strictest gun laws have the most fun related crimes while cities where there are relaxed gun laws and allow concealed carry , open carry have the fewest gun crimes and the citizens feel safer.

Chicago is not a gun free zone. Stop trying to say it makes criminals

Chicago IS virtually a gun free zone and that does make it easier to be a criminal. These mass shootings take place in gun free zones for a reason. Gun free zones are the safest place’s for a criminal to commit a act of this kind of horrific magnitude. The media purposely misrepresents the shooters, the tools used and the situation to reflect away from ties to Islam, ethnicity of the shooter and promote anti gun sentiment. Misdirection, twisting of the facts, omitting facts all to direct the masses to think in a certain way. Not the truth but their version of what they think the truth should be.

One of the problems with using Chicago as an example (there are many), is that the gun laws in the city are tighter than they are in the surrounding county and state. This is one of the problems with tightened, but local, gun laws; all one has to do to go around them is leave the city, county, state… and presto, you have access to a gun. And while we refuse to close the loopholes in background checks (making all gun sales subject to them… and I don’t want to hear, “I shouldn’t have to check my grandfather”… if your grandfather can’t pass a background check he doesn’t deserve a gun, and as long as criminals keep getting around 40% of their weapons from their friends and relatives, who may or may not know about their history… we need to close the loophole…. you shouldn’t be able to go on Craigslist and buy a gun, or cross the state line and buy one, etc. MOST of the guns used in our mass shootings have been purchased legally and somehow made available to the shooters, usually by not being secured.  We need coherant, consistant, responsible gun laws that are enforced evenly. Domestic violence is one flag we need to address – take guns out of those situations and murdering your spouse/lover/ex becomes a whole lot harder.




 












 
 
says:
 












Along your reasoning, do you really believe if we outlawed all private gun ownership, that with 7000+ miles of unguarded borders where tons of drugs, and  millions of illegals cross that guns wouldn’t be brought into America too? If you ban gun ownership, the citizens would be totally unarmed against bad actors with guns. If you want to change gun ownership rights change the 2nd amendment. Nothing you will do will stop a crazed criminal from getting a gun or killing innocents.

Amen. Mention background checks, closing loopholes (like privates sales), training… and I get a blistering from “responsible” gun owners who also balk at being told they should lock their guns up, etc. I know responsible gun owners (they go to the ranges, have gun safes, don’t leave their weapons out for their kids/grandkids to pick up)… but there is a whole ‘nuther class of gun owner out there that is more worried about their “rights” and freaking out about “They’re going to take our guns” every single time that ANY regulation is mentioned… when it’s more about “rights” than “responsibiity”, people who don’t own guns only see “irresponsibility”.

You will never hear a responsible gun owner “balk” at properly securing his/her guns, it is in their best interests as well as those around them. You should stop trying to color citizens that lawfully own and responsibly use guns as crazies. It is a legitimate concern that our rights are being threatened. Stop the ignorance of blaming the tool and place responsibility where it belongs with the individual. If you spent more time aiming your ebonics slurs at thugs instead of decent citizens we as a society together might be able to change the tide of violence in this country.

Yeah it would be great if we lived in a world with no weapons of mass killing, but we do so we have to deal with reality. I for one would rather have a gun to shoot that guys before he shoots my family.

If some of those poor students or teachers had a concealed carry firearm, some of them could have fought back when the shots began. Think about it : You are sitting in the next room, he shoots the teacher (you hear the gun shot and grab your back pack and within 5-10 seconds you are sitting at your desk with your firearm waiting for him to enter your classroom. You then go next door and stop the rampage. And if you are too scared at least you save those in your class if he comes after your class or office. Please Mr. President leave the guns alone. They are our last line of defense against the crazies out there.

What a horrible person you are.  Americans were the kindest people in the whole world to black people, had the institution of slavery forced on them at the point of a bayonet by a Catholic King, and wiped it out completely from all infected areas of their country within 80 years of gaining Independence from the British Kings who had forced the Royal Slave Trade on them.  We fought for you, to free you. You were freed, helped on your feet, patted on the back, and that was that. Everybody was even steven.  Otherwise nothing happened to you that everybody did not experience too (OK the richy rich aristocrats always had it good, and always tried to use other people for their profit, is that who hate? Say So!

Not to mention these black slaves were sold by black slave owners who owned more black slaves than America ever did. We don’t often hear about that though. We also don’t hear about a black president who wouldn’t have been elected without the help of whites. Had whites voted the same 99% based on race like the blacks did but instead for our “own” white candidate, we’d have had 8 years of McCain/Palin.

What an ignorant and overly self-absorbed comment. No one has control over the individual, and if someone wants to get a hold of a gun in this country, they will, whether it is illegally or legally. It is so goddamn easy to put a label on everything, claiming people of a particular group causes this and that such as mass shootings. “Liberals” and “conservatives” is irrelevant, but since it is easier to call names and categorize things people do. It’s a fact both people, right and left wing, own guns. And here is the question: Who gives a shit what political category the person who kills masses of people? Would it matter if he was liberal or conservative? Religious or atheist? He still killed people, no matter how people or how he labels himself.

The second Ammendment is there to specifically protect us from not only foreign entities that invade, but to protect us from our own government!

This is a bunch of bs… Again and again this renegade government kills more innocents in an attempt to massively trample rights of we the peasants… Obama getting on TV and putting on his best Hollywood scene talking about “americans are desensitized” to such tragedies… Oh really? Tell me Mr president, when was the last time you took a cyber trip over to killedbypolice.net and took a good look at the atrocious information contained there?? Notice how these are the statistics reported on and doesn’t include a full record of killings… So where’s the outrage on that, Mr president?


There are a tremendous number of holes in this story, so many that I think maybe the orchestrators of this false flag event are trying to bank on the sales of recreational marijuana more than consistency of information and believable facts for getting the locals to buy this buncha bs.

A conservative republican californian from los angelas CALIFORNIA goes to the redneck town of roseburg, armed with a gun into the community college and into a specific class all where no one knows him and starts shooting people for having any form of religion… Really? And of course, no one knows who this guy is, takes all day to put a name on it, still don’t know what gun was used or how the shootout with local pigs goes… Sounds like another one of them training exercises with security releases/contracts involved with everyone who was there. Let me guess, top secret training operation? Please, the number and amount of leaks to be expected from ROSEBURG… And everyone’s hush hush. Really. In roseburg. Must be very powerful somebodies responsible for such silence, as usual… No. I don’t know if anyone is actually hurt, if anyone is actually dead because of this I hope not but I wouldn’t put it past these enemies and terrorists we call “government” after all they have proven on multiple occasions that they are fully willing to sacrifice the very lives of we the chattel we the peasants in pursuit of their political agendas… our renegade tyrannical government has proven on many occasions to date that they are fully prepared to extinguish the lives of we the peasants without remorse in any attempt to achieve their political agenda/goals. Look at 9/11, look at killedbypolice.net these tyrants have no qualms with butchering we the peasants to accomplish their political goals…

I wonder why these jackasses are always shooting up “gun free zone” schools. Is it because they are bullies going after the fish in the barrel?? I’m sure. Whichever route to creating the most fear and outrage is the route they usually take. The path of least resistance, this is the path such scum grow on. This garbage has false flag, government sci op written all over it I hope the peasants here in Oregon will not be so stoned this weekend as to fall for it. Hold on to those guns, lock and load. Oregon is becoming california at a rapid rate, notice california leads the whole world in police butchering DISARMED/UNARMED ordinary peasants. Get ready, its getting chilly out again, government wants them weapons and looks like they are making a move on them.

The U.S. Policy was exactly the same at the time as they didn’t allow their secondary citizens to buy guns either.  No law will prevent criminals from giving up or acquiring guns, period. This criminal coward was in a gun free zone but that didn’t stop him.

For one this so call fake event wasn’t fake I have family and friends at that school today they were lucky enough to get out unscathed but point being the dam evnt happened. This should not be an argument over who’s right the whole event is a tragedy and the responsible person was apprehended. Yes guns are hard to control does that mean noone should own guns? NO! Guns do not have a mind of their own they don’t walk around killing people!?!?! Just quit nothing with each other and focus on the fact that events like this keep happening all over the united states. Focus on the families that have lost loved ones. Focus on the families that have injured loved ones. RESPECT THEM AND STOP BITCHING. SOME PEOPLE DIED TODAY AND OTHERS ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES! Sometimes I really hate reading comments

Its an event that happened just as much as 9/11 was an event that happened… An inside job is an inside job is an inside job and when an inside job is a successful operation is when outsiders like you and me and your friends and family (who attend ucc) are none the wiser to the inside job taking place. Come on dude, in roseburg this guy goes into the college past everyone to a specific teachers classroom armed with “3 handguns and a semiautomatic rifle” at 1030 in the morning and no one stopped him… What, did he TELEPORT IN THERE???? Inside fuckin job, look at it for what it is. Obama administration attacking the political career of Douglas county sheriff who swore to uphold the rights of the citizens in his jurisdiction. Fuck Obama and fuck each and every willfully ignorant (stupid) soul who does not see blatantly that this was a government coordinated operation.

Reading through these comments I see everyone being so nasty to each other. Why is there SO MUCH HATE FOR EACH OTHER? Ironic because this is where this shooting stemmed from… Hate for others opinions and beliefs. We are all entitled to our own thoughts, opinions, and beliefs. It’s not anyone’s job to call others out on something they don’t agree with, let alone add hateful word like “fucktard” or “moron”. This shooting should hopefully make everyone sit back, take a deep breath, and think about how they can be more respectful of others so this society can move away from these senseless shootings. You don’t have to have a god, or a religion; just respect and decency for those you share this world with.

That was not the point and your intentional mischaracterization is an example of what people do when they have no argument against common sense! A individual’s rights should not be taken away because someone else makes a personal decision to abuse that right. Example: no one would own cars because of vehicular homicide caused by drunk drivers. We knew back in elementary school that it was unfair to punish the entire class for the actions of one or two students. Adult justice is no different in principle.

Actually… Most people who kill are actually just “following orders”. In fact, the majority percentage of those who kill being those who are following orders is so staggeringly high that there is actually an internationally recognized syndrome associates with it ” post traumatic stress disorder” or “shell shock” which is the fucking up of the psyche of a usually good person who has done something in opposition to personal conviction, most commonly the killing of others while following orders and not necessarily in self defense. So yeah, even with events such as this one, the most common people who kill are those who have been given the order to kill. The real psychopaths are the ones GIVING the orders, not the ones taking them, statistically…

I’m with you on sandy hook for the most part. Still not sure if that was faked or if Lanza was just a fall guy for the Mossad.  2 guys in the woods with fatigue pants and black shirts (just like Lanza) just happened to be walking in the woods at the time, were apprehended and then never heard from again. Hmm. I don’t think this one was totally faked but wouldn’t rule out mkultra. It always seems like the shooter is killed and therefore can’t speak. The one weird thing about today was the chat messages that the news had several hours before anyone even knew his name.  For the everything I see on TV is true crowd, how is that possible?

Bombs whether big or small are not by them selves responsible for killing people either, it’s the people that use them but that does not mean that you would trust random people around you carrying them talking bout it’s registered. A gun is not a bomb but it presents a great enough danger where in the wrong hands it can take many lives like a bomb. You gun pro people get on my nerves if your not in a profession that does not require it on you or your not hunting or in an area that obviously presents great danger, why should you have it. Why should anyone trust you mofos with it? We don’t know you from a hole in the wall! guns are just too much of a big responsibility for randoms to be walking around with talking about “it’s registered” ok…. And….? I don’t know you, or who might have access to ur gun. What is it about ur random ass that lets people know your trustworthy enough. (Cuz we already have people who illegally have them) You can have no common sense but still get a registered gun. And don’t talk about people getting it illegally cuz people can get any damn thing illegally but stricter gun laws would help to some degree. I feel ANY help is good help. I don’t say take them completely away from the public but they have to evaluate a lot more with more restrictions on the types of guns and where you can take or keep it. (Just a note It’s not the drug dealers or “thug life” people (who people mostly feel get guns illegally) doing these intentional random ass killings in least expected places)

Catholic terrorists murdered millions of Christians, Jews and whoever else they suspected of being a non-believer before, during and after the inquisition. If you do not believe this, read any history book on this subject . This hatred for each other began in the 4th century when the Catholic church was started.

If you don’t want to acknowledge the tremendous change and progress we have achieved it must be that you are willfully ignoring it. Anger can be intoxicating and self-consuming, my friend. It will ruin your own quality of life before it ever hurts your enemies. It’s easy and even fun to be angry and it becomes a crutch to blame others.
