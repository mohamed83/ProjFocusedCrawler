The shooting was also broadcast live on the air. That video is below, and again, is disturbing:








































The shooting happened at about 6:45 a.m. Virginia State Police said his vehicle was spotted on Interstate 66 and tried to make a traffic stop.


“The suspect vehicle refused to stop and sped away from the trooper. Minutes later, the suspect vehicle ran off the road and crashed,”

The Twitter account has been suspended.


Vester Lee Flanagan, AKA Bryce Williams, is the alleged shooter who killed reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward of WDBJ-TV live on-air in Moneta, Virginia. 




2. He Told ABC He Was Inspired by the Charleston Church Shooting & Was a ‘Powder Keg’


Flanagan went by Bryce Williams while on the air for WDBJ.


On his Twitter account, he said Parker made racist comments. He also said Adam Ward went to human resources on him.


a 23-page fax from someone named Bryce Williams after the shooting. ABC said it has shared the fax with police, and posted some of its contents Wednesday afternoon. The fax came about two hours after the shooting. He also called ABC twice in the hours after the shooting.


In the fax, Flanagan wrote, “Why did I do it? I put down a deposit for a gun on 6/19/15. The Church shooting in Charleston happened on 6/17/15 … What sent me over the top was the church shooting. And my hollow point bullets have the victims’ initials on them.”


He also referenced Virginia Tech shooter Seuing Hui Choi, calling him “his boy,” and expressed admiration for the Columbine High School shooters.


Flanagan wrote that he suffered racial discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying at work, because he was a gay black man.


“Yes, it will sound like I am angry…I am. And I have every right to be. But when I leave this Earth, the only emotion I want to feel is peace,” he wrote. “The church shooting was the tipping point…but my anger has been building steadily…I’ve been a human powder keg for a while…just waiting to go BOOM!!!!”


A gunman opened fire on a news crew in Moneta, Virginia, during an interview Wednesday morning on live TV at the Bridgewater Plaza.

(Twitter)


Flanagan, often using the on-air name Bryce Williams, has worked at several news stations around the country,


He worked at WDBJ from March 2012 to February 2013.


“Vester was an unhappy man. We employed him as a reporter and he had some talent in that respect and some experience,” WDBJ General Manager Jeff Marks said on the air. “He quickly gathered a reputation of someone who was difficult to work with. He was sort of looking out to people to say things he could take offense to. Eventually, after many incidents of his anger, we dismissed him. He did not take that well. We had to call police to escort him from the building.”


Reporter Joce Sterman of WJLA obtained documents from the lawsuit Flanagan filed against WDBJ after his filing:






Flanagan was written up by WDBJ in '12 for several incidents where employees felt threatened, was REQUIRED to contact Health Advocate @ work


— Joce Sterman (@jocefromthenews) 








Court docs show police had to be called the day Vester Flanagan was fired from WDBJ in '13. Adam Ward filmed him being escorted out by cops


— Joce Sterman (@jocefromthenews) 








Vester Flanagan personally wrote the judge when filing suit against WDBJ, wanted "jury of his peers…comprised of African-American women"


— Joce Sterman (@jocefromthenews) 








Flanagan likened his situation to a David vs. Goliath scenario at WDBJ, calls himself an expert "in the difference between right and wrong"


— Joce Sterman (@jocefromthenews) 




Video from his career as a reporter was posted on YouTube:








































Flanagan is originally from California and graduated from San Francisco State University. He previously worked at WNCT-TV as a reporter and anchor, WTWC-TV, WTOC-TV, KMID-TV and KPIX-TV.


His former boss at WTWC, in San Diego, Don Shafer, 
about Flanagan, saying he was “a good on-air performer, a pretty good reporter,” but “things started getting a little strange.” Shafer hired Flanagan in 2000 and also fired him for “odd behavior” the same year.


“I know that there were some issues with him and his personality that kind of (spiraled) down, and that’s why we had to get rid of him,” Shafer told San Diego 6, adding that Flanagan got into arguments with co-workers. “I don’t want to say anything more about that, but … I didn’t see (a dangerous aspect) in his personality.”


Adam Ward, a 27-year-old cameraman at WDBJ-TV, was killed along with reporter Alison Parker during a shooting on live TV in Moneta, Virginia.

Lol” Flanagan joined Twitter on August 12 and posted pictures from his high school graduation, from his time as a model and from other jobs he has held, in the days leading up to the shooting.


His father, Vester Flanagan Sr., played professional. football. He was a lineman at Humboldt State University and was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in 1960, 


Alison Parker is the 24-year-old reporter who was killed live on TV for WDBJ in Virginia.

I like how you get on this site as “Anonymous” and become a keyboard killer hiding behind your screen like the racist coward that you have proven you are. You are forgetting two major facts: 1). Not all blacks that have been killed by the police were criminals…….2). The facts remains that even if a person is guilty of a crime does NOT give the police the right to kill some one, especially when white folks do the same and some times worse, and the white folks don’t get killed. Now, how about you bring you bitch ass out in the open where people are able to  see who is so proud to make the statement you made. Bitch ass fucking cracka!

Classic case, this guy was most likely mobbed at work, possibly to make room for the girlfriend of someone at the station, after trying to sue the station, they took the mobbing out into the community. A spokesman for the station admitted workers from the station would run into him at stores and in the community. I believe many of those encounters where in fact mobbing, designed to make him move out of the community.




 












 
 
says:
 












Yes, the goal of this kind of mobbing is running someone out of the community- no different than the KKK. I’m finding references to “every now and then, station employee ran into him”, in Google searches, but apparently, when I read the news articles these have been “edited”. A lot of news is “edited” to filter out facts that counter the official narrative.

I also noticed the “parallel construction” or “back engineering” that law enforcement employed to cover their use of “the Stingray Device” to follow his cell phone in order to find him. They brought forward a female officer and said it was a plate reader used to validate registrations that located the car which wasn’t even his, he was in a rental car. They really do not want people to know about “Stingray”, it’s that backbone to community harassment.

Are you stupid? So your saying that if a white person shoots a black person that it’s racist? And if a black person shoots 3 un armed people not doing anything but right is not racist? Even though that he admired other shooting and wanted a race war with the Charleston shooter, he’s totally not racist my ass. Get it together and learn your facts please.

No one is comparing his behavior to Black Lives Matter it is because the SHOOTER identified with Black Lives Matter and in his myriad of suicide notes referred to it – Get a Life – the shootings in cases like Ferguson were not intentional – the Officers were not found to be guilty of even second degree murder (murder without premeditation) but rather incidental.  The black people shot were resisting arrest in and in many cases the lives of innocent people (not just the officer) were in question.   It is you that don’t get it, SMH

Total bullshit video. The adamnistration is hard at work again to either ban guns or start race shit again. Nobody takes one shot…let alone 3 or 4 shots and just runs. That looked like a .45 or a .9mm and if u get shot you drop instantly. Not to mention….the guy is just standing there holding up a gun and nobody sees him???




 












 
 
says:
 












Drop instantly?


Either you have been watching too much TV or have no real understanding of ballistic damage.


These were not head shots.  A 9mm and even a 45mm won’t always drop you instantly.  It depends on the shot placement.  Also, the camera falls to the ground quickly – we have no idea how far she ran before she dropped.


Remember – shock + adrenalin can keep you going for a bit.

We live in a society where there’s extra emphasis on “bullying”.  I know that bullying is bad, but it happens to everyone.  It starts in elementary school and continues until we die.  We’re going to be told things that we don’t want to hear from time to time…  The problem is, people are killing each other because “they were bullied”.  I’m sick of this crap.  Learn to deal with it.  Our society is becoming so screwed up…


Cue gun control debate…

Cue bullying debate…

Cue race debate…


Why can’t we just admit the obvious here?  This man has had problems on the job before because he was a miserable son of a bitch.  The church shooting is a cop out.  The “discrimination” is a cop out.  He had a negative attitude towards everything and everyone.  If he was going to kill himself, he should have just done it.  But that’s not enough for these deranged bastards…  He had to take people with him.  May God watch over their families.  May God deal with him accordingly.




 












 
Chris

Yeah, the people that don’t tolerate being put down to make other people feel better about their pathetic existence are the problem… Bullshit. You want to keep your family happy and healthy, start by teaching them some manners and respect for other people. People that show no regard for others get none in return. All that “words will never hurt me…” stuff is true in so far as it is far more likely that they will be fine after the bully finds out what “sticks and stones” feel like. Not everyone was brought up to be your kids ego boost. They just might unwittingly run into an even bigger asshole than they are.

Whites are bullied and killed each day. I’m feeling that your color blinds you from seeing that what Dillon Roof did was retribution for what the average white puts up with from inferior and insecure black people on a DAILY BASIS, and is justified. We need more people like him to kill more people like you.

The problem with ignorance is its like a silent illness-you can die without knowing you have it but I’m going to rob Angie of that pleasure. Angie, your statement about blacks being inferior has NO scientific basis. In fact, science says otherwise. But keep thinking you’re superior but while you’re at it, Google ‘replacement migration’ and read about how you “superiors” are not reproducing fast enough to outpace death. You do know you can go through life thinking you’re winning even when you’re not don’t you?

Okay, I’ve unsuccessfully (of course) tried to make some sense out of something that doesn’t make ANY sense whatsoever. Still, here are my thoughts: Vester had some complaints about Adam Ward that could be proven. For example, he stated that Adam went to HR after working with him once. Well, HR would have records of that. NO excuse for what he did but that is something that he claimed happened that could actually be proven.  It doesn’t really matter what it was about because he took it very personal as he seemed to do most things. Now, what really stands out to me, however, is his absolute hatred for Alison. He mentioned something about her making racist remarks but still being hired. I obviously don’t know whether she did or not (I do not believe she did), but this couldn’t have been the first time he heard/heard about someone saying something racist. It took him 2 years to get to this point. I believe he watched her newscasts religiously and his ultimate motive for hating her and shooting her first and as many times as he did was jealousy. She was well-liked, attractive, young, happy and going somewhere. She was everything he wasn’t. He was a psychopath/narcissist/racist with a victim mentality. That type of person wouldn’t let his jealousy be obvious so he used racism as his excuse. He was upset that his life/career wasn’t where he thought it should be….where Alison and Adam’s were. So, I think he was jealous of this star of the station AND he also wanted to get back at the station so he decided to take away the “star” and star team. Anyone else think jealousy could’ve been his real motive (not that we will ever know)?

He made the whole race thing up about those two people. VESTER AND ALISON NEVER MET until the day he killed her. Alison actually worked here where I live in Jacksonville, NC. She worked at WCTI News and didn’t leave to go to her new job there until LONG after Vester Fagalin was fired. Alison was a nice piece of ass too. She loved us Marines here at Camp Lejeune and she supported the troops as any good single(at the time) woman should in her own way. I actually have some pictures and video of her getting double teamed by me and another Marine. I’m thinking of selling it once I find out if it is going to be completely legal. Should be since she knew we were taking pictures and video. Hopefully I can get enough for a new F150. Anyways, I hate little cowards like Vester Fagalin who pull the race card when it’s a complete lie. What you said is probably correct. He saw her on the news and saw that she replaced him and was much better then him at the job.

Can you explain one thing for me.

Watch both videos and tell me where is the sun. ….. look at the shadows…… tell me the time of day that both of these videos were filmed. 


In both videos the shadows are indicating the sun is high in the overcast sky and there are no long morning shadows …. this alone proves false flag …. the pics and videos of the ambulance at the scene it has long shadows indicating early to mid morning. 


Then you have the facts that throw big questions out there.

The camera man who was shot  attended Virginia Tech in 2007 when 32 were supposedly killed in a false flag there.

There is a picture of the 2 reporters in makeup getting fake blood and false gunshot wounds. 


As far as you having pictures of her being double teamed come forward with that now …. she left where you were because she had this false flag operation to work….

Come out with those pics and videos they will show the real nature of these false flag actors. …. besides I would love to see her with her mouth full…. 


She left where you are because she was getting the big bucks to do this false flag operation. Obviously she lied to everyone for personal gain.

I agree the shooter was defintly mentally ill. I think it’s strange that he says Adam went to Human resources after “just one time”  If someone does something that violates a work policy or you don’t feel you can resolve something with someone on your own..going to Human resources is an option. Although the direct supervisor is usually next in the chain of command not human resources./Anyway, It shows that the shooter is a grudge holder and counts offenses..whether real or imagined. Anyone who wants to resolve issues by walking up to a group of people and shooting unarmed people …whether they want to blame it on racism , a bad childhood , or other people..the bottom line is they are mentally ill. And it shouldn’t be glorified. It is an act of a mentally ill person that chooses to harm others.  This guy sadly, somehow identified with other mentally ill mass murderers.

Another gun grab opportunity. There was something not right about the shooters video that I at first did not watch. Where was boyfriend of reporter at when he was tweeting about the shooting? I am tired of them thinking we are gullible. If it really happened, sorry, but innocent people everyday get shot. It is not televised so it is not important. That is why we need guns because if this was true, then maybe they would have had a fighting chance. That early in the morning, you wouldn’t have seen this guy walking up with a gun then standing there? You critically think about that and try not to be so gullible out of the gate. I do not trust these shooting since the Ronnie Parker act were he was laughing the day after his child was killed, then he got in character when they filmed him. Blame that on my hesitation.

The live shooting was speed to be at 6:45 am . … sunrise that day 6:45 am however in both videos the sun was high in the overcast sky and shadows were under the people not long morning shadows as there should have been 


False flag is proven by this alone

Additional proof

Cameraman attended Virginia Tech in 2007 when 32 supposedly killed in false flag there

Both reporters were photographed in make up getting fake blood and wounds

Tweets began about the shooting before it supposedly happened

The father is an actor and has business handling cCan you explain one thing for me.

They weren’t reporting, you are right they are actors, not the way you think. What you are watching is a commercial being made for the chamber of commerce of that area, under the guise of legitimated news. The synergy of marketing, local government and commercial interest, much the same as the large propaganda networks the conspire to lull the public to sleep. Being on the inside as “Vester” was, he would know the difference…. It would be quite difficult to know where news is going to happen, unless you already know it’s not “news” but scheduled propaganda.


The hoax is the your watching news.

Yes Carol Sullivan aka Sunshine on her radio blog called for lone wolves to take arms and kill people and post it on social media.  A couple of days later this happened.

And two if it was a live broadcast why was the camera man not filming them????? And how could you get shot CLOSE range and not fall see no blood???? All bullshit!!!!! My country The United States of America should be ashamed of this bull!!

I went through several jobs with discrimination charges and the results were the same. You just can’t prove it. You can’t prove the sexual harassment unless you are a white female. I feel sorry because there is so much some people can take. My resulted in depression, heart attacks, strokes and finally I just hypertension out of the work place with heart disease. You just feel hopeless and there is nothing you can do. Yes, there is anger. Maybe we really need to stop looking at this Television Station denial. I’ve worked on jobs where people came back and shot the doctors or person they thought were responsible for their pain. We really need to stop and listen.

I wonder if his clear resemblance ot actor Lamorris Conner from Up in the Air had something to do with this.  Conner was the black guy who brings the audience to tears when he talks about his kids in his exit interview after being fired.

Totally fake. How could two women not notice a big black man (that one of them knows) standing a few feet away with a gun out pointed at them? Or the other explanation is the women are idiots. The white camera man is cool…he had no idea.

easy… with ear pieces and focused view, its rather easy.  They have a narrow line of sight and cannot hear much of anything going on around them.


People don’t pay attention that much.  Same way you can see people texting on their phone and walk into a wall… they are so preoccupied with what they are doing they have no clue whats going on around them.

That TV station handled that fireing in a way that made a bad situation worse. This guy was mentally ill, clearly, but why was Adam allowed to videotape part of the termination? That’s not how it should have been done. It was humiliating and ultimately led to the deaths of these two young people. The station better lawyer up!

The world is truly a better place when a-holes like Flanagan no longer resides in it.  He sounded like a very confused boy.  A Jehovah’s Witness AND high paid companion?  Translation:  HOOKER!  Wonder if members of his congregation knew he was living that type of lifestyle?  It’s really no surprise.  So-called religious blacks accept any and every type of behavior, especially of the sexual nature.  Hell, the majority of black pastors are screwing other men and boys!  The so-called single black females are screwuing married men.  Some of them are elderly blacks who have lived in sin for years.  All of this shows that blacks are so out of control and have been for a very long time.


BTW, blacks are the REAL bitch azz es!  It’s not a secret because everybody knows it!
