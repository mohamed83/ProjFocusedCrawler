Oregon college gunman’s family shocked; he shared views on religion online
Authorities in Roseburg, Ore. have not speculated on why 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine at Umpqua Community College before dying in a shootout with police officers. At a news conference Thursday evening, an agitated Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin offered little detail about the gunman. Public records don’t indicate that Harper-Mercer had a previous criminal history and most of what is known about him at this point is through those records, family and his online presence.
I will not name the shooter. I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act.
Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin
Public records show that the gunman lived with his mother, a licensed nurse, 2 miles from the college. It wasn’t immediately known if Harper-Mercer was enrolled at Umpqua, but one student told Yahoo News that students in the classroom where the shooting took place did not recognize the gunman. Ian Mercer, the gunman’s father living in Tarzana, Calif., refused to answer reporters’ questions outside his home, but called it a “devastating day” for him and his family. Harper-Mercer’s disdain for organized religion was evident on his social media, where he identified as “not religious, but spiritual." The former California resident was notably active on a torrent upload site, where he shared the BBC film “Surviving Sandy Hook” and could also blog and write in forums. The day before the shooting, Harper-Mercer was active on the site.
He was a nice guy, and he put everyone before himself … it doesn’t sound right.
Carmen Nesnick, stepsister of Chris Harper-Mercer
