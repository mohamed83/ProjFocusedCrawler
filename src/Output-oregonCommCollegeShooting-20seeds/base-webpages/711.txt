Retired, off work: Oregon medical personnel rushed to aid shooting victims


When gunfire rang out on the campus of Umpqua Community College Thursday, Dr. Jason Gray, chief medical officer of Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg, Oregon, and Kelly Morgan, the hospital's CEO, were among the first to respond. Gray describes the condition of wounded victims treated in the hospital to TODAY's Natalie Morales, saying "the community has not seen something of this magnitude" before. Morgan praises the "phenomenal teamwork" of medical personnel at the hospital, noting how many employees came in on their day off and some retired personnel even came in to help.
