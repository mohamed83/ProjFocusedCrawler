     We're hearing new information in an officer involved shooting in the Bethel area Monday night. 


     Police are now talking about what led up the shooting death of Brian Babb.


     Eugene Police Chief Pete Kerns says the call came in just after 5 p.m. Monday night at a home in the 2200 block of Devos street. 


     He says Babb was on the phone with his counselor.


     That counselor then called 9-1-1 after Babb said he was feeling suicidal and fired a shot inside his house.


     Kerns says crisis negotiators tried to work with Babb but were unsuccessful.


     Police sent out an armored car to assist in the situation, asking for everyone in the house to come out unarmed. 


     Babb's roommate came out and then Babb came to the door.


"Only the officer who was in the roof hatch could see Mr. Babb so we only know, we don't yet know what he saw he hasn't been interviewed. What we learned from radio traffic is that Mr. Babb aimed or pointed a rifle at the officer and the officer responded by shooting on Mr. Babb," said Kerns. 


     Kerns says the armored car was more than 100 feet away from Babb when the fatal shot was fired. 


     He says the armored car was driven to the front door to administer aid But babb had already died. 


     Kerns says EPD has had another investigation involving Babb.


     In officer involved shootings a special team investigates before it goes onto the district attorney who will review for criminal or administrative charges. 


     The officer who fired the fatal shot has not been identified as of yet.


     Kerns says that could happen within the coming days.


     That officer remains on administrative leave during the investigation.
