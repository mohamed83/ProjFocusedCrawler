			Oregon Mall Shooting Gunman Identified After Apparent Suicide					










The masked

According to

Police have yet to release the names of the deceased.


Clackamas County Sheriff’s Department Lt. James Rhodes said that authorities are still in the process of contacting and informing victims’ families.


According to Clackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts, an injured victim has been transported to a local hospital where she is “fighting for her life.”


Nadia Telguz, a friend of the injured victim, told 
ABC News
 affiliate 
KATU-TV
 in Portland that the victim is expected to recover.


Telguz said:


“My friend’s sister got shot. She’s on her way to (Oregon Health and Science University hospital). They’re saying she got shot in her side and so it’s not life-threatening, so she’ll be OK.”


Roberts said that police responded to the scene of the shooting within minutes. Upon arrival, four SWAT teams began sweeping the 1.4 million-square-foot building searching for the gunman.


The gunman was eventually found dead due to an apparent suicide.


Rhodes said:


“I can confirm the shooter is dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. By all accounts there were no rounds fired by law enforcement today in the mall.”
