LAFAYETTE, La. — A man opened fire inside a movie theater in a Lafayette, Louisiana, multiplex, Thursday night, killing two people and wounding seven others — before taking his own life.


“There’s nothing to believe that there was any kind of motive,” said Col. Michael Edmonson of the Louisiana State Police.


The shooter was a 58-year-old white man who was a movie theater patron, police said. Authorities have his name but are withholding his name as the investigation continues.


The shooting took place at the Grand Theatre 16 in Lafayette, about 45 west of the state capital, Baton Rouge.


About 100 people were inside the theater for a screening of the comedy, “Trainwreck,” when the shooting happened shortly before 8:30 p.m. ET.


The scene immediately after the shooting was chaotic.


“A whole bunch of girls started screaming and we heard that someone was shot,” Roxy Martinez told CNN affiliate KATC. “There were a lot of people running.”


Her brother saw a woman who had been shot in the stomach.


“I see a lady full of blood in a dress,” Robert Martinez said. “She was just looking at me in complete fear.”


Todd Moffatt, manager of a Mellow Mushroom pizza restaurant in the area, said 20 to 30 emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene. The area was locked down, he said.


Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal tweeted, “I’m on my way to Lafayette right now. Please say a prayer for the victims at Grand Theatre and their families.”


Lafayette is a city of about 120,000 people 60 miles west of Baton Rouge.


The shooting happened days after the conviction of James Holmes in the July 19, 2012, Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting that left 12 people dead and 70 people wounded.
