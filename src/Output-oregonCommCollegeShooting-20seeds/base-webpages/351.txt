ROSEBURG, Ore. -- The Roseburg community showed its strength and its sorrow Thursday night at a vigil at Stewart Park hours after 
. 



Hundreds of people filled the park’s natural amphitheater at dark and held candles. The overwhelming message from the crowd was “love.” The tight-knit community wants the world to know they’re going to stand together and make it through this tough time. 

     

Sabrina Hansen said she was baby-sitting for a UCC professor who wasn’t hurt when the shooting happened. She said she went to the vigil to show support. 



“All of our families are coming together and being there for each other,” Hansen said.



Andrea Fisher brought her husband, Greg, 12-year-old son, Brett, and 11-year-old daughter, Mickayla, to the vigil. She felt it was important to her children to see how the community is responding to the shooting. 



“We wanted to be here for the community and to be here for them and to pray over them and have peace,” she said.



Benjamin Ray Hodges told KATU News he drove 30 miles from his home in “the sticks” of the Coast Range to Roseburg to spread peace. He sat on the grass during the vigil holding his family’s American flag. 



“Even far out in the sticks we still feel the spirit of the town and remorse (for) the ones that are dead,” he said. 



Oregon’s Gov. Kate Brown also came from Portland to Roseburg and attended the vigil. She told the crowd she, and the entire state, also stands with them. 



“We will remember and honor those lost here today and in this way they will live forever in our hearts,” she said. 



But the crowd didn't only listen. They also had something to say. 



A few people chanted “I am UCC!” Then that turned in to “We are UCC.” 



The chants were a stark reminder from a collective voice that so many are feeling this tragedy, and so many are strong. 



Some local government leaders also attended the vigil. The outpouring of support really moved them. They encouraged everyone to stay strong and not think about hate.
