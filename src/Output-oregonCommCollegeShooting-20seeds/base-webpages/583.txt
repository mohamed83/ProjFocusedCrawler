ROSEBURG, Ore. -- While we now know the shooter's name that information did not come from Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin.




In the 7 p.m. press conference Sheriff Hanlin went before reporters saying he would not identify the gunman. He said he would not give him the credit he probably sought, prior to this horrific and cowardly act.




“The media will get his name, but you will never hear me mention his name. We would encourage you not to use it and create sensationalism for him,” Sheriff Hanlin said.


















The shooter died during an exchange of gunfire with officers. It wasn't clear if he was killed by authorities or took his own life.
