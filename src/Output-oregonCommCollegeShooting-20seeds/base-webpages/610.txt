A shooter at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon on Thursday killed 10 people are dead and left 7 more wounded. The shooter has been identified as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer.
What We Know About The Shooter
Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin confirmed that the shooter is dead during a press conference. In a separate press conference later that evening, Hanlin would not confirm the identity of the shooter. However two law enforcement sources 
 the shooter is 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer.
In one post on the blog about Vester Flanagan, the man who killed the reporter and cameraman in Virginia, Mercer apparently wrote, "I have noticed that so many people like [Flanagan] are alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems like the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight."

Additionally, the 
 troubling details found on Mercer's MySpace page.
The MySpace page features a photo of Harper-Mercer holding a gun and smiling into the camera. The profile includes images of pro-Irish Republican Army propaganda.

Neighbors 
 he was a loner.
Neighbors in Winchester, Ore., and Torrance, Calif., where Mr. Mercer, 26, lived with his mother, Laurel Harper, remember a reclusive and seemingly fragile young man with a shaved head and dark glasses who seemed to recoil from social interaction.

CNN reports that several guns were recovered at the scene.

One eyewitness's 
 of the attack:
Kortney Moore, 18, from Rogue River, was in her Writing 115 class in Snyder Hall when one shot came through a window. She saw her teacher get shot in the head. The shooter was inside at that point, and he told people to get on the ground. The shooter was asking people to stand up and state their religion and then started firing away, Moore said. Moore was lying there with people who had been shot.

In May, Oregon became the 12th state to institute universal background checks for all gun transfers, including private gun sales between individuals, at gun shows, and sales arranged over the internet. That was quickly followed by a mass demonstration of gun owners on the State Capitol’s steps and claims by some gun dealers that they would refuse to perform the checks.
But that law may not have been enforced in Douglas County, where Umpqua Community College is located:
In April, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said it would be impossible to enforce recently passed state laws extending background checks to private sellers. “This law is not going to protect citizens of Oregon,” said Hanlin.

 Vice President Biden in 2013 regarding his opposition to gun control measures:

: Sheriff of Roseburg wrote to Biden in 2013 to say he won't enforce "unconstitutional" gun control laws.

[T]he Oregon State Board of Higher Education took up the issue, setting a policy that allows guns on campus, but bars them from college buildings and sporting venues. Umpqua Community College upholds this ban, making an allowance for those “expressly authorized by law or college regulations.”
[

But he 
 not to get involved:
"If there was something we were able to do, we were going to try to do it. Luckily we made the choice not to get involved. We were quite a distance away from the actual building where it was happening, which could have opened us up to being potential targets ourselves. Not knowing where SWAT was on the their response time, they wouldn’t know who we were, and if we had our guns ready to shoot they could think we were the bad guys."

In 2006, Roseburg High freshman Vincent Leodoro shot fellow student Joseph Monti four times in the back while both were in the school courtyard. Monti survived.... 
As a result, Roseburg-area institutions, including Umpqua Community College, made plans for how to handle and try to prevent active shooter scenarios.

"Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It does not convey the heartache and anger we feel." —

"We are the only advanced country in the world that sees these mass shooting every few months." —

Obama challenged media outlets to compare gun deaths in the US to American deaths in terrorist attacks — here's that comparison (from August):






Obama wanted news organizations to put gun deaths and terror deaths side-by-side. We did.

The State Of Mass Shootings In America
In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, six adults, and himself. Since then, there have been at least 986 mass shootings, with shooters killing at least 1,234 people and wounding 3,565 more.

[This shooting] brings the total of mass shootings this year — incidents where 4 or more people are killed or injured by gunfire — to 294. 
There have been only 274 days this year.
