ROSEBURG — McCrae Kittelman was in math class Thursday morning at Umpqua Community College when he first heard about a shooting in the school's science building a short walk away.

He said his professor sprinted into the room. 


"That was one of the most strange and disquieting parts," said Kittelman, 17, "is that there were no sounds at all."


The state attorney general released a statement shortly after 1:15 p.m. Thursday that 13 people died in the shooting, but Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin would not confirm the number of dead or wounded during a news conference at 1:30 p.m. PDT. At a second briefing late afternoon, Hanlin said 10 people were killed and seven wounded. He said the gunman fired on law enforcement before being killed.
















































































































 


 





 


Reports of the shooting were first called in at 10:38 a.m., police said, with Kittelman's mother, Marilyn, first learning of it six minutes later. She immediately began texting her son — who responded. 


"All of a sudden everyone was freaking out about stuff happening over in Snyder Hall, which is right next door to where my math class was being held," said McCrae Kittelman, who gave interviews to Fox News and others while still in lockdown. Hanlin would not confirm whether the shootings occurred in Snyder Hall. 


"One girl got a call saying a friend of was shot, which was really hard," McCrae Kittelman said. "One of the most surprising things about this was there were no sounds."

Kittelman and the rest of the college's campus, which is accessible by a single road and sits on a hill overlooking the Umpqua River, were evacuated by buses to the Douglas County Fairgrounds, where they remain. He described the campus as calm during the evacuation. 

Law enforcement have blocked all access to the college via Umpqua College Road, with ambulances and buses leaving while local, state and federal law enforcement officers have continued to arrive.


His mother, a Douglas County Commissioner from 2004-08 and an editor of Roseburg's Beacon newspaper, stood at the closed-off intersection as the first buses left campus.


"I waved at him," Marilyn Kittelman said. "It's just a relief because I've been texting him for two hours while he's been hiding behind the desk."
