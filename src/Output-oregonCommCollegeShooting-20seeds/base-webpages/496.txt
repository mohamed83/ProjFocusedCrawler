CONNECTICUT
 -- Thursday night at the White House, President Obama lamented that we, as a nation, have become numb to mass shootings. And though he said many 
 the prospects seem slim, despite what happened Thursday in Oregon.
For those wanting to see some form of federal gun control legislation passed, it was the shooting they thought would finally get it done.

Newtown, Conn., still looking for answers



                                            For Newtown, Conn., residents, the days ahead will see vigils, services and soul-searching. Jim Axelrod reports, as a community looks for answers...
                                    




December 14, 2012, Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School. 20 first graders, six educations, shot and killed by a deranged gunman armed with a Bushmaster semi-automatic rife and Glock semi-automatic pistol.
Newtown families went to Washington to push for stricter gun control measures. Jillian Soto lost her sister Vicki, a 27-year-old teacher who hid some of her first grade students in a closet during the shootings, and died saving them.
"I will continue to fight, until everything is done because if it is not in Connecticut, its gonna be somewhere else," Jillian Soto said.
Sandy Hook Elementary first-grade teacher Vicki Soto, 27, who died shielding her students from the gunman.

Since then, the U.S. has seen 142 shooting on school properties in the U.S. -- that's an average of nearly one a week.
Bill Sherlach lost his wife Mary, the school psychologist at Sandy Hook. He looked at Thursday's shooting in Oregon, and the grief and despair rushing back.
"These kids got up this morning and went to school and they are just never coming home," he said.
So Thursday night, Americans are wondering what may come out of another massacre. Shock, horror, sadness? Sure. But chances are, if recent history is any guide, you wont see change on the list.
