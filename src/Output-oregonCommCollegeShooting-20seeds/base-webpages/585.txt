     The police have cleared but there's still plenty of mystery surrounding a deadly officer involved shooting in a Bethel neighborhood.


     Outside the home where it all happened Monday night the destruction is still in the driveway, you can still see some of the crime tape up and a fence destroyed.


     As we wait on more details from officers we're learning more about the man killed.


     He's a decorated war veteran and family man.


"These two awards he got was actually he saved a guy's life who was suicidal. It was a guy that actually put great big river rocks in his pockets and walked right past my brother down into a pond," said Ronda, McGowan, Brian's sister. 


     Looking at photos of her brother, Ronda McGowan says that's just who her brother Brian Babb was: someone who jumped into action to help and a veteran who served his country.


     "He was a decorated war vet. He did a lot of good things for people. You know when he was younger he rodeoed. We're from this area so everybody in town knows him," said McGowan. 


     But for the army captain who served overseas in Afghanistan, McGowan says he was battling his own demons.


     "He had some traumatic you know things happen there. He came back and was very very much suffering. You know he had a traumatic brain injury while he was over there," said McGowan.


     Babb's deployment wasn't easy.


     He went through a divorce.


     Once home as a civilian he was diagnosed with post traumatic disorder and sought out several resources through the VA but was still struggling.


     Details are still slim about what happened at this home on Devos Street in Bethel Monday night.


     For McGowan, rushing to the scene of police activity, she too is filled with a lot of questions as her family tries to come to grips with what happened, mourning the loss of her brother Brian.


"He was a decorated war hero. You know? And he did do a lot of good good things, he really did. So it's really hard to understand and kind of comprehend," said McGowan. 


     Some flowers and a flag have been placed at the end of Babb's driveway as a memorial.


     Eugene Police say they should release more information on the officer involved shooting Wednesday.
