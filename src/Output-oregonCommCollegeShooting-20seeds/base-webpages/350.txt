 in Oregon notes that it is not surprising that the Douglas county sheriff, John Hanlin, is sticking with his anti-gun control stance. Hanlin is an elected official whose position reflects that of many of his constituents in the county. 


Jason has more on the conservative leanings of rural 
.




Oregon’s blue state reputation belies the fact that outside the cities on the I-5 corridor, it’s mostly deep red. Douglas County is no exception. 


Barack Obama might have called the citizens here “
” yesterday, but the feeling is not mutual. 62.3% of them voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, and only 37.4% for him. 


Liberal Democrat governor Kate Brown is here to support the citizens, but they did not support her predecessor John Kitzhaber at the most recent election. 59.4% voted for his Republican opponent, Dennis Richardson, who was soundly beaten in the overall state vote. 


At the same time, they voted down progressive measures that the state as a whole passed, like marijuana legalisation. 


The forests may no longer provide the employment they used to – and Douglas County has what are among the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the state — but they are still full of game. 


Just as in other parts of rural America, guns are part of life in Douglas County, and concerns about gun rights feature in its politics. 


The rest of the country might see the events at UCC as a reason to tighten gun laws, but don’t be surprised if the citizens of Roseburg disagree.

 reports from the northern suburbs of Roseburg, where he spoke to neighbors of the gunman.










 




Jim and Cindy Bright have lived on Village Drive for 13 years and raised their son there. 


Still, they hadn’t seen Mercer’s face until the media began broadcasting it last night.


“We had no idea that guy lived there,” Jim said. “We didn’t want to know that.”


Cindy voiced a common sense of disbelief that such events would happen in Roseburg.


“You always are immune, oh it will never happen here,” she said. “It’s a small town, and it’s a very conservative town.”


It’s also a religious town, as the world saw last night in images of prayer from the candlelight vigil.


The Brights were more inclined to talk about the implicit assault on their faith, rather than guns. 


Jim said, “The thing that keeps coming back to us is how he asked people their religions, and if they were Christians he shot them in the head.”


Cindy finishes his thought in a tone of grief and indignation.


“We’re Christians. This is America.”

Dr Jason Gray, chief medical officer at Mercy Medical Center, just spoke from outside the hospital in Roseburg. 


Gray said 10 people were initially admitted to the hospital. One of those people died in the emergency room, but the nine others are expected to survive. 


He said that staff members who had the day off and retired physicians came in to help with the response to the shooting. 


Of the original 10 patients, three had to be transferred to another hospital that has a higher level trauma center. Two people were treated and released.


“To the best of our knowledge, the shooter was not treated here,” Gray said.

CNN’s reporters are pushing hard on the issue of gun control this morning.


Oregon House representative Dallas Heard, a Republican, lives in Roseburg and was visibly shaken during an interview with CNN’s Michaela Pereira.


Pereira asked Heard about his thoughts on gun control, saying “if not now, when?”


“It could be next week for all we care,” Heard said. “The wound is still open and bleeding.”


He said he agreed to the interview explicitly to ask people to pray for the community, where “everybody knows everybody”. 


Pereira extended her sympathies and explained that when it comes to reporting mass shootings in the US, “many of us are tired of being here again”.


Heard said that not enough details were known about the shooting to have a good discussion about how to prevent something like this from happening in the future.

Umpqua student Melody Boqua told CNN that she hid under her desk during the shooting. 


“I didn’t know where the shooting was and I didn’t want to be a running target,” Boqua said.


The mother of three said she could not distinguish between the gunfire from police and the gunman. “I’m not really sure what I was hearing because there was so much chaos,” she said.


Boqua said that at church last night she heard a water bottle pop and it “freaked her out”. But she was surprised how calm and composed she was this morning. “I don’t know how this [trauma] is going to go in the long-run,” she said.

Community members turned out in droves on Thursday night to support each other during the candlelight vigil held in Stewart Park in Roseburg, Oregon, following a tragic mass shooting, reports 
Ben Kendall
.










 




Clutching close to her partner, Umpqua Community College freshman Alicia Sparks held a candle in solidarity to those who endured the terrifying ordeal.


“I was in the science hall ... and everybody heard something, but wasn’t sure what it was and then we got an email that there was a possible shooter on campus,” Sparks said.


Sparks and her classmates waited out the lockdown in the center of the hall, where there are no windows.


UCC physics major Mark Hamill was in the gym during the shooting.


“I went over to the office to ask the officials there: ‘Is this for real? Is there really an active shooter?’ Then, when I walked out ... I heard three, four, five shots. Sounds like firecrackers,” Hamill said.


Hamill waited out the lockdown in the gym with his classmates in the dark behind closed doors. 


Both students were relieved by law enforcement and escorted to the vehicles taking the students off campus.


Oregon governor Kate Brown addressed those in attendance in Stewart Park as did pastors and UCC student veterans, who offered their support and solidarity.


The crowd chanted: “UCC, I am UCC, we are UCC, I graduated from UCC.” The vigil raised their candles in unison. Taps, the US military funeral piece, was played by a lone trumpet on stage followed by a bagpipe. 


The Red Cross ran a canteen table distributing free refreshments to all at the vigil, as well as providing support to those in need.


Carol Gross, a disaster mental health volunteer with the Red Cross, said: “We have a cadre of licensed professional mental health people who respond to distress and do exactly what we’re doing here which is provide support to the community and to individuals.


“I’ve come to realize that regardless of how many people are affected, it all boils down to the individual and the disaster that each individual feel in the own heart, in their own life.”

Hours after the shooting on Thursday night, community members held a vigil at Stewart Park, about 10 miles from Umpqua community college. 


 was on the scene for the vigil:










 




Benjamin Ray Hodges told KATU News he drove 30 miles from his home in “the sticks” of the Coast Range to Roseburg to spread peace. He sat on the grass during the vigil holding his family’s American flag.


“Even far out in the sticks we still feel the spirit of the town and remorse (for) the ones that are dead,” he said.

In the past three years, there have been 994 mass gun attacks in the US. 


And the Umpqua shooting is not the first one to occur this week. Two mass gun attacks happened on Monday and Tuesday in Chicago 
 where 14 people were shot, six fatally. 


My colleague 
 has 
: 










 




America’s gun problem goes deeper still: on the day of the Newtown shooting, many noted that if that had been the only shooting that day, the day’s death toll from gun violence would have been below the US average.


That was even more true on Thursday. The number of firearm homicides in 2013, the last year for which the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has statistics, was 11,208. The year before Sandy Hook, it was 107 fewer than that.


That’s just intentional homicides. Firearms are the cause of death for more than 33,000 people in America every year, according to the CDC; a number that includes both accidental discharge, murder and suicides, which are on the increase, especially in states with lax gun-control laws, according to the New England Journal of Medicine.

Douglas county sheriff John Hanlin just spoke on CNN, where reporter Chris Cuomo pressed him on the issue of gun control. 
 said that gun control “is not the answer” for preventing events such as school shootings. 


“My position has not changed,” Hanlin said towards the end of a tense interview. 


During the interview, Cuomo repeatedly questioned Hanlin on how such an event could be prevented in the future.


“The debate and discussion over firearms is going to occur; now is not the time,” said Hanlin. “We want to focus on the investigation.”


More importantly, Hanlin said, families of the victims needed space to grieve. 


But Cuomo, who said he had reported on too many mass shootings, would not relent. 


“Again, Chris, I want to stay focused on completing this investigation and focus on the families of this victims,” Hanlin replied. 


The sheriff said he would contribute to discussions about gun violence “at a later time”.

Summary




Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the aftermath of the latest mass shooting in the US. You can see our previous live blog for 
. This blog will focus on the political fallout and further details about the shooter as they emerge. 


Here’s what we know so far: 


What happened, when and where?


A 
 and wounded seven more at a community college in Oregon before he was killed. Emergency services first received a report of shots fired on the 
 campus in the rural town of Roseburg at about 10.38am. The community college, which mostly provides adult education to students in their late 20s, has about 3,000 registered students but only a few hundred attend full-time.


Who is the gunman?


The killer has been named as 
, who lived near the college in an apartment complex in Winchester with his mother. Mercer was born in the UK before moving to the US at a young age. He was the son of Ian Bernard Mercer, a restaurant manager who lives in Tarzana, California, and Laurel Margaret Harper. Ian Mercer, said he was 
 at his son’s actions. Although little more is known about Mercer, he appears to have left an online footprint that hints at interest in mass shootings as well as apparent support for the IRA. A neighbour, Bronte Hart, said he lived upstairs and would “sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light”. Mercer was cornered in a hall by a police officer who reported exchanging shots with the man.


How did this happen?


There are scant details about the attacks as they unfolded. Eyewitnesses have told reporters that Mercer fired through the doors and windows of a classroom before making his way through the 16-building campus. CNN reported that four guns were recovered at the scene of the killings. Kortney Moore, 18, 
 she was in her writing class when a bullet came through a window and hit her teacher in the head. She said Mercer then ordered students to stand. It was not clear whether he had been a student at Umpqua college although a listing from a Noel Coward play staged there had his name posted as a production assistant.


Did the gunman have a motive?


Investigators are focusing on reports from survivors that Mercer 
. The police were also looking at reports that hours before the attack he posted messages on an internet chat site warning people to stay away.


How have the local police reacted? 


The 
. “I will not give him the credit he probably sought with this horrific and cowardly act,” said Hanlin. “You will never hear me mention his name.” It also emerged that Hanlin has lobbied the White House against restrictions on gun ownership. 


What’s been the political reaction?


President Barack Obama, 
, said the country was numbed by the repeated massacres. He urged individuals to lobby the authorities to implement “common-sense gun laws”. He said:










 




“This is something we should politicise ... We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?”
