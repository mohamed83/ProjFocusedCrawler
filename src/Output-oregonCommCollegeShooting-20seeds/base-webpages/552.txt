(CNN) -- The man suspected of shooting nine people inside a Charleston, South Carolina church Wednesday night is now in police custody.




Authorities in Shelby, North Carolina arrested Dylann Roof, 21, of Lexington, South Carolina after he was spotted Thursday morning.




Police say he shot nine parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.


















Eight of them died at the scene, the ninth died on the way to the hospital.




Police say Roof attended a bible study class for about an hour with the eventual victims before he began shooting.




Charleston police say the victims were killed 'because they were black'.




The Department of Justice is opening a hate crime investigation into the shooting.
