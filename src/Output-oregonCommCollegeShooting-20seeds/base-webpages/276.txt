	The Oregon sheriff at the center of Thursday’s shooting tragedy is a proud supporter of the Second Amendment.



	In January 2013 — abouta month after the Sandy Hook school shooting that left 20 children and six staffers dead — Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin wrote a letter to Vice President Joe Biden expressing his opposition to gun control legislation.







	Limiting access to guns was “not the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” Hanlin wrote in his lengthy letter.
 
 
 
 
 
 



	He also put Biden on notice that he wouldn’t be pleased if the White House tried to “tamper with or amend” the right to bear arms.



	“The United States Supreme Court has ruled that when a Sheriff chooses to enforce an unconstitutional directive, he is violating his Constitutional Oath,” Hanlin wrote.



	“I will NOT violate my Constitutional Oath .... any [directive] offending the Constitutional rights of my citizens shall not be enforced by me or by my deputies,” he said.
 
 
 
 
 
Read the letter Sheriff John Hanlin wrote to Vice President Biden.
 
 
 



	The Sheriff was one of several lawmen who wrote to Biden, who was appointed the White House point man on gun control 
 
 in the wake of the December 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn.



	Hanlin also spoke out in March against a proposed state law that would require background checks on private gun sales, saying such a mandate wouldn't prevent criminals from getting guns.
