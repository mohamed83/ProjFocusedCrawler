President Obama pauses as he speaks about the shooting at Umpqua Community College.
 
 
 
 


An angry President Obama addressed the nation on Thursday after another massive shooting, the 15th such address of his presidency. Here are some excerpts:



	There has been another mass shooting in America.







	This time at a community college in Oregon. That means there are more American families, moms, dads, children, whose lives have been changed forever.



	That means there is another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relive their own anguish, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might’ve been their families, or their children.

	But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings: Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It’s not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted somewhere else in America next week or a couple of months from now.



	**********







	We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. Earlier this year I answered a question in an interview by saying the United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun safety laws even in the face of repeated mass killings. And later that day there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, La.

	Somehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here, at this podium, ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We’ve become numb to this. We’ve talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation. Right now I can imagine the press release is being cranked out. "We need more guns," they’ll argue. "Fewer gun safety laws." Does anybody really believe that?



	**********



	And of course what’s also routine is that somebody somewhere will comment and say, "Obama politicized this issue." Well this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together. To the body politic. I would ask the news organizations, because I won’t put these facts forward, have news organizations tally up the number of Americans that have been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans who have been killed by gun violence and post those numbers side by side on your news reports. This won’t be information coming from me; it will be coming from you.

	**********



	When Americans are killed in mine disasters, we work to make mines safer. When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes, we make communities safer. When roads are unsafe, we fix them to reduce auto fatalities. We have seatbelt laws because we know it saves lives. So the notion that gun violence is somehow different, that our freedom and our Constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law-abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations, doesn’t make sense.







	**********



	And each time this happens I’m going to bring this up. Each time this happens I am going to say that we can actually do something about it. But we’re going to have to change our laws. And this is not something I can do by myself. I’ve got to have a Congress, and I’ve got to have state legislatures and governors who are willing to work with me on this. I hope and pray I don’t have to come out again during my time as President to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experiences as President I can’t guarantee that.
