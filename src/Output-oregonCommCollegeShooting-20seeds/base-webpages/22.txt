There are reports that the gunman
 on the anonymous message board 4Chan.


that police are investigating whether the posts were connected to the shooting.


The post Wednesday night at 7:19 p.m. local time said ‚ÄúSome of you guys are alright. Don‚Äôt go to school tomorrow if you live in the northwest.‚Äù


Some posters on the message board encouraged him and egged him on, while others told him it was a bad idea.


One person responded saying, ‚ÄúI suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire. Make sure that there is no way that someone can disarm you as it it possible. I suggest you carry a knife on your belt as last resort if someone is holding your gun.‚Äù


Another poster said, ‚ÄúYou might want to target a girls school which is safer because there are no beta males throwing themselves for their rescue. Do not use a shotgun. I would suggest a powerful assault rifle and a pistol or 2x pistols. Possibly the type of pistols who have 15+ ammo.‚Äù

Don‚Äôt you blame a planned event on marijuana, your a joke. Millions of people have smoked marijuana and have never shot up schools. You defecting from the real problem which is WE SELL HUMAN OFF SWITCHES OVER THE COUNTER TO WHOM EVER WANTS THEM!

We need to get after mental health problem here in America. Its not the gun that‚Äôs driving these people to kill, it‚Äôs their mind.

This shooter reached out to others with his plan, and no one helped him! Why? Because we are afraid to talk about mental health. We look at it as a weakness, as a perversion, as something to be afraid of. No wonder these shootings continue to happen.




 












 
 
says:
 












Here we go again.  Let me predict what we eventually learn to be true:


1. The shooter will be someone who was known to do and say things that indicated he was dangerous, but for various reasons nothing was done because he hadn‚Äôt actually killed anyone yet.

2. The shooting will have taken place on a publicly designated gun free zone.  (These mass shooters are always crazy but never stupid.)

3. The shooter will not be an NRA member.

4. The shooter will not be a concealed carry permit holder.

5. The shooter will either have obtained his gun(s) illegally or because his mental illness was not recorded in the system gun dealers use to avoid selling guns to homicidal maniacs.

6. The shooter wasn‚Äôt asking people their religions because he wanted to kill the Muslims.

4. All proposed liberal solutions to prevent this from ever happening again will involve disarming the sort of people who

    a. Never commit them.

    b. Could greatly reduce the casualties if we allowed them to carry weapons  in what are now publicly designated gun free zones.

Joe Yoblonkski, thanks for admitting that the only fault you could find with my argument was a typo; that really was quite the compliment on your part.

So TRUE

fact #6 ‚Äì the school is a gun free zone.  these zones are turning into dangerous places.

What are the odds that these mass shootings occur if the shooters were aware that anyone and everyone on the premises could be legally carrying a gun?




 












 
 
says:
 












Based on a study of all the mass shootings in the US since the 1950‚Äôs, the odds are approximately zero because only one of them that took place outside of a publicly designated gun free zone: the shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and several others, which took place on a public street.

The main problem of firearms grinding against ethic of personal value and right to self protection  is ‚ÄúTHIS‚Äù very problem,

‚ÄúMass Shootings‚Äù.

No other arguments against firearms are ethically applicable finally.


As the ‚ÄúPATTERN‚Äù of infliction unfolds in America, the same principals apply about mass shootings and the vulnerability of crowds and high density concentrations of people e.g. schools, movie theaters, arenas e.t.c.


Once again, none of the correct procedures for protection of people whom require to gather and cooperate in a high density has occurred!


One of the FIRST in this particular

‚ÄúCONSISTENT HIGH POPULATION DENSITY ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURE PRONE TO MASS SHOOTING AND RIOT‚Äù has been ignored,

that being a fence should be surrounding the gathering containment area and a specific set of entry and screening protocols !!!!!!!!!!!!!


The SECOND, no implementation of boundary fence and entry protocols at federal level has been enforced to be applied all over the United States !!!


Don‚Äôt bother to have an anti-gun lobby or campaigns until you have corrected those two failures to implement security policy !!!!!!!


NOTE: An interesting FACT!!!

ONE OF THE GREATEST TRICKS AT SAYING ‚ÄúEMERGENCY HELP NEEDED‚Äù IS TO ****‚ÄùBREACH THE PROTOCOL OF ENTRY TO SECURED BOUNDARIES‚Äù*** WHETHER ARMED GUARDS ENTRY POSTS OR INHIBITION SYSTEM(easy climbable non damaging ‚Äì near to step-over) PERIMETER FENCES !!!!!!!!!




 












 
What?
 
says:
 












If you want to live in a world of perimeter fences and security checks, move to Israel or Afghanistan or Iraq or North Korea. You‚Äôre all set. If you want to live in a world where a homicidal maniac has more rights than a whole school of small children and their educators, move to ‚Ä¶ wait ‚Ä¶ no, you are stuck with US. Sorry.

It‚Äôs reported that the gunman said on Facebook ‚ÄúThis is the only time I will ever be in the news, I‚Äôm so insignificant‚Äù and what happens? He gets exactly the attention he wanted because every news channel, paper, app in America is telling his name, and probably the ‚Äúsad‚Äù story of how he ‚Äúsuffered‚Äù from a mental illness and was ‚Äúmisunderstood‚Äù. If media and law enforcement abroad started to NOT give the names and info of the people who commit these horrible atrocities then they would be stripping away the motive. The motive is not hate, lots of people hate and don‚Äôt kill. I think the true motive in these situations is to go out with attention. These are copycat massacres happening one after the other after the other. I think nothing more than the age and sex of the shooter should be reported. I‚Äôll bet we would see a decline in the number of mass shootings. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Just my thoughts‚Ä¶

Impossible. It‚Äôs a gun-free zone. It is illegal to take a gun on campus, so how was he able do this? 


Congress needs to make even more legislation in opposition to the Second Amendment to he Constitution to take guns away from law-abiding citizens so that criminals will never do this again.
