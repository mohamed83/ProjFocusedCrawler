Huckabee Slams Obama’s ‘Shameless’ Attempt to Politicize Oregon Shooting

Mike Huckabee
 issued a press release tonight, where he blasted 
President Obama
 for rushing to politicize the 
 without knowing the details of the tragedy.


“For this president to make a political pronouncement is at best premature and at worst ignorantly inflammatory,” Huckabee wrote. “Obama can shamelessly try and exploit any tragedy he wants, but it’s clear that gun free zones are sitting duck zones.”


Obama gave a 
 from the White House earlier today, blasting how America has seen numerous violent rampages over the past months, but nothing changes because of it. The president also took aim at those who would accuse him of “politicizing” the tragedy, saying “this is something we should politicize.”


Huckabee not impressed with the conference, saying that Obama’s passion was misplaced in an attempt to “destroy the Second Amendment.”


You can read 
 here:


We hardly know any of the details about this horrific tragedy – What kind of gun was used? How did the shooter obtain it? What is the motive? Does the shooter have a history of mental illness? Was this an act of terror? With few facts, Obama is quick to admittedly politicize this tragedy to advance his liberal, anti-gun agenda. For this president to make a political pronouncement is at best premature and at worst ignorantly inflammatory.


Obama can shamelessly try and exploit any tragedy he wants, but it’s clear that gun free zones are sitting duck zones.


His passion is grossly misplaced into destroying the Second Amendment. There were 50 shootings in Chicago the past two weekends and this administration failed to utter a word. Gun violence is a problem in this country, but it’s not the fault of the Second Amendment it’s the fault of evil people doing evil things.
