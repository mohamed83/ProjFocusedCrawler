Police said that at least three were dead, including the shooter, after a gunman opened fire at the Grand Theatre in Lafayette. Seven more were injured, authorities said.


When an individual suggested that Zarrell first give the victims and their families “a brief moment of respect,” she responded.


“If this were someone in my family id want every person alive screaming about gun control to anyone who would listen,” she tweeted.
