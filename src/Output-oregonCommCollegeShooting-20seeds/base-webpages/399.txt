a 23-page fax from someone named Bryce Williams after the shooting. ABC said it has shared the fax with police, and posted some of its contents Wednesday afternoon. The fax came about two hours after the shooting. He also called ABC twice in the hours after the shooting.


In the fax, Flanagan wrote, “Why did I do it? I put down a deposit for a gun on 6/19/15. The Church shooting in Charleston happened on 6/17/15 … What sent me over the top was the church shooting. And my hollow point bullets have the victims’ initials on them.”


He also referenced Virginia Tech shooter Seuing Hui Choi, calling him “his boy,” and expressed admiration for the Columbine High School shooters.


Flanagan wrote that he suffered racial discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying at work, because he was a gay black man.


“Yes, it will sound like I am angry…I am. And I have every right to be.

(Twitter)


Flanagan, often using the on-air name Bryce Williams, has worked at several news stations around the country,


He worked at WDBJ from March 2012 to February 2013.


“Vester was an unhappy man. We employed him as a reporter and he had some talent in that respect and some experience,” WDBJ General Manager Jeff Marks said on the air. “He quickly gathered a reputation of someone who was difficult to work with. He was sort of looking out to people to say things he could take offense to. Eventually, after many incidents of his anger, we dismissed him. He did not take that well. We had to call police to escort him from the building.”


Reporter Joce Sterman of WJLA obtained documents from the lawsuit Flanagan filed against WDBJ after his filing:






Flanagan was written up by WDBJ in '12 for several incidents where employees felt threatened, was REQUIRED to contact Health Advocate @ work

His former boss at WTWC, in San Diego, Don Shafer, 
about Flanagan, saying he was “a good on-air performer, a pretty good reporter,” but “things started getting a little strange.” Shafer hired Flanagan in 2000 and also fired him for “odd behavior” the same year.


“I know that there were some issues with him and his personality that kind of (spiraled) down, and that’s why we had to get rid of him,” Shafer told San Diego 6, adding that Flanagan got into arguments with co-workers. “I don’t want to say anything more about that, but … I didn’t see (a dangerous aspect) in his personality.”


Adam Ward, a 27-year-old cameraman at WDBJ-TV, was killed along with reporter Alison Parker during a shooting on live TV in Moneta, Virginia.

dhale2291, while I agree with your statement that you can just as easily kill with a car, I think this sick bastard would have had a hard time climbing the steps to where they were in a car!  Maybe a motorcycle, but then we’d have to ban motorcycles as well!  I don’t understand these people who think outlawing guns makes anyone safer.  Just look at where open carry of guns is legal and compare the statistics of gun deaths to somewhere like Chicago.  They truth speaks for itself.  Too  bad it is such a political issue and not grounded in common sense!

Why are geniuses like you so incapable of understanding one simple thing… The bad guys will ALWAYS have guns… they will always find guns. No gun law will prevent a psycho from obtaining a gun. The only thing gun laws will do is take away guns from law abiding citizens who want to protect themselves and their families. 


And 2 + 2 = 4




 












 
Todd
 
says:
 












Wrong.  Laws have already stopped many “phsyco’s” from obtaining guns.  Your such a genius you swallowed the myth wrapped in a farce and told as a lie the “bad people will always get guns”.  First, the enormous, criminal black market for firearms you imply exists on every street corner does not.  Second, you imply we should not make it harder for insane people to get guns.  So insuring easy access to guns for nutcases is okay with you.  All that action pretty means you’re probably not smart enough to have one yourself “genius”.

Hey, Todd!!! Hows it goin buddy? Remember that psycho who forced a homeless man to get naked, and then ate that homeless guys face off? Yeah, you know the one. They said it was initially due to use of bath salts but their toxicology report said he didn’t have bath salts in his system. Turns out he was just loony tunes? Do you remember that one? Hmm, I guess crazy fucks do crazy shit with, or without guns… ((((DROPS MIC))))


Life lesson for Todd – Where there is a will, there is a way.

Guns don’t kill, people do.. and if you think making guns illegal is going to help-it won’t. Then only people that don’t mind breaking the law will have guns.. Crack is illegal, heroin is illegal, and guess what? YOU CAN STILL FIND THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Making guns illegal won’t do anything except take away your protection from people who want to use guns to harm other people.

That’s because guns are a tool.  Guns don’t pick them selves up and kill people.  Killers use them to kill people. More people die in auto accidents every year and I don’t see people wanting to ban cars.  No one wants to talk about the many lives saved by guns every year.  This is not a gun problem.  It’s a humanity problem.  Criminals and bad guys will always own weapons and use them illegally.  Do you think criminals follow gun laws?  The majority of mass major shootings involve gun free zones, like college campuses and movie theatres.  This is because the murderers know that good guys cannot legally have a firearm to protect themselves on these premises and they have a chance of killing several individuals before policy show up or they get taken down by someone with a CHL.

It IS a gun problem, and whether you know it or not, YOU ARE A FUCKING IDIOT.   And people who want to  change things and make it less likely for shootings to happen like this have to dance around FUCKING IDIOTS LIKE YOU who are in constant denial that there is a serious problem with guns in this country.    Again… in case I wasn’t clear.  YOU ARE A FUCKING IDIOT.   I doubt you’ll agree… but I’d expect nothing less from A FUCKING IDIOT!

Hey Anonymous, what if he had killed them with a knife which can be a “tool of destruction”?  Would you then be blaming knives?  The issue should be the violent action, not the tool with which that violent action took place.  An irresponsible person that kills someone with a car gets in trouble and possibly sent to jail without anyone blaming the car.  Will you start calling for the ban of knives, hammers, rope, cars, etc.?

If not a gun, it’d be something else.  When there’s a will, there’s a way,  I’d rather be shot than beat to death with a pipe, over a matter of 5 minutes of taking blows.  It’s actually more a problem that so many of us American’s are entitled and don’t care about anything but ourselves.  I am not including in this group, but a good chunk of the population is.  It’s a sad state of affairs.  Most of my fellow American’s are pieces of crap.  So maybe… just maybe, a gun is more humane, if someone is looking for a way to take somebody out.  Food for thought anyway.

This “only guns kill people” argument is so defeated it may as well be up there in the hall of fame with “the next president will fix everything”

Beside his complexion, he had freckles (not a trait present in people of pure African blood; it came about later in a certain non-African population as a mutation), and his last name is Flanagan, a common Irish surname. This man was biracial. This was not a black man. He was no more black than he was white, genetically.

YAY!!! Cecil is a douche bag! Do you know your current events and statistical data? It’s called mathematics. Blacks are roughly 13% of the U.S. population. Ok so write that down. Now between the years of 2011 and 2013 blacks were responsible for 38.5 % of the violent crimes in America, including murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. On top of that blacks are responsible for 52% of all homicides in the U.S. between the years of 2008 and 2011.  So here we go…. are you ready? A group of individuals that can be categorized as black and wich represent roughly 10% of the U.S. citizens is committing over 1/2 of all the murders in the U.S. and over 1/3 of all violent crimes in the U.S.


I find it utterly insane that people such as yourself, you know … biggots, can seemingly compile a group of people that make up aproximatley 80% of the worlds population, (eastern and western european, russian, middle eastern, north american, etc) and blaming the entire existance of your personal struggles on this one group that makes up the majority of the planet. The fact of the matter is this, the rest of the world moved on … maybe its time to join us? If you truly look at history, everyone was a slave once,  yet black americans are the only ones still sitting around bitching about how horrible shit is. You cry when the cops shoot you for jumping out of your car with a sawed off shotgun. You cry when your kids get shot for bull charging and getting in fights with cops. Now you even cry racism when a black man murders two two inocent people on TV. Yeah .. ya know what.. fuck you. Fuck your struggles. Nobody hands you shit in life. If the world seems like it has a problem with you then YOU need to change YOU, the world doesnt bend, ok fuck head?

Women are half the population, yet commit less than 15% of all homicides. Black women, like all women, commit far less violent crimes and homicides than do white men, so don’t bother pretending MEN’S issue is a black issue. MEN need to be banned. Turn those guns on yourselves, white men, and take black, Arab and Latino men along. Men are the bane of the country, world, planet. Period.

MEN are the bane of the earth, and need to be cleansed from this world. Women of all colors can learn to live in harmony once black men AND white men are gone. If you want to get rid of violent crime, do the world a favor and take yourself and your fellow white MEN along when you wipe black MEN out. Thanks.

This guy is a psycho bottom line.  It has nothing to do with his skin color. For everyone trying to stir up the racial shit by declaring it’s over him being black let me tell you something! Most serial killers are white.  People shooting up schools?  White.  Shooting up movie theaters??  White.  So stop with this nonsense.  When are we going to also start determining the mental health of African Americans?  Anytime a white person does it, people claim the person was mentally ill or taking anti-depressants or a lone wolf.  This person does not reflect all African Americans.  Just like all those white criminals do not reflect all white people.  You can tell someone is a racist when they decide to lump everyone into the same category when it’s something negative that happened.


RIP Alison Parker and Adam Ward.

Grow some brains, moronic gun lobbyists. Just look at the murder stats around the world. Easy availability of guns == more innocent dead people. End of conversation. And if you cite that “right to bare arms” bullshit, that was written into the constitution how long ago? Weapons have moved on SO much since then.

Are you for real? We validate the taking of innocent lives because at some point in his career he may have been mistreated as an employee? I’ll give you the fact that racism is bad and shouldn’t happen period. But, every white racist could change overnight yet if black racist don’t change as well, nothing will change! For you to claim that he should have gone after the ones that did him wrong instead of these two is validating his actions. People need to grow up and stop letting everything under the sun offend them. To kill someone in cold blood is a cowardly act because he wasn’t man enough to deal with his problems as an adult! You ask what happened with the EEOC complaints? The fact is he sued this station over it and lost. No evidence to support hi claims. He also sued other employers over similar claims and lost them as well.  Maybe the racism he thought he was experiencing wasn’t racism at all. Maybe he was looking for a quick buck? That we’ll never know! But you thinking what he did was legit is absolutely amazing,  how could any reasonable person have that view?

Well Lisa, yet again you fail to do research. These individuals were not involved in the so-called lawsuit which was settled in 2000. These are generally settled because the amount of money the defendant seeks is far less the cost of going to trial. It’s never about guilt and always about the bottom line when dealing with a corporation. Oh and also the victims would have been  approximately 9 and 12 years old. I don’t think they were working there at that point. Then the other lawsuit from 2013 was dismissed, so the point is moot. So in neither case was anyone found guilty of anything. Is your point that an unconfirmed allegation being made to the EEOC by a man who is crazy and murders people on live TV outweighs the fact that he indeed murdered people in cold blood on TV? 


In response to how an individual walks up to someone on a deck holding a gun, I think it was blatantly shown in the video how it’s done. The camera man and reporter do likely have earpieces in and you can’t see them. They need to talk to the station to know when go live and what not. It’s not like a giant antenna hanging out of their foreheads, they are small like hearing aids so people like you still think TV is magic. Also, she likely doesn’t call herself a reporter anymore because … well … she’s dead. 


With all that being said, Lisa, I would like you to now go and take a brick and toss it directly through the front of  your microwave. Then set the timer to 5 minutes at the highest setting. Stick your head in it and push start.
