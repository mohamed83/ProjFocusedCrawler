At least one student fought back during the shooting at Oregon’s Umpqua Community College, 
 to try to save himself and his classmates.


30-year-old Army veteran 
Chris Mintz
 was shot seven times while rushing the shooter. As he lay bleeding, witnesses say he kept saying over and over “It’s my son’s birthday, it’s my son’s birthday.” His son Tyrik turned six Thursday.


Despite his injuries, Mintz was rushed to the hospital and is in stable condition. “From what I’m hearing, he’s fine,” his cousin 
. “But he’s going to have to learn to walk again.”
