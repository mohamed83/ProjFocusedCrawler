A witness said the shooting happened in Professor Larry Levine’s class:

(Spiritual Passions)


He writes that he is, “Not Religious, Not Religious, but Spiritual.” And says, under personality that he is, a “lover, conservative, professional, intellectual, introvert.” He also says under interests, “internet, killing zombies, movies, music, reading.”

4. He Wrote On His Blog ‘Seems the More People You Kill, the More You’re in the Limelight’


(Kickass Torrents)


Harper Mercer 
and also often uploaded to the file-sharing website. One of his last uploads was a documentary about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting:

— Vanguard 14 (@keksec_org) 




On the blog,
, the disgruntled former TV reporter who killed a reporter and cameraman in Virginia in August.


“On an interesting note, I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more your’re in the limelight,” he wrote.


He also wrote about the shooting of a police officer in Houston, Texas, saying “This whole event seems similar to the one in new york earlier this year where that guy killed those two cops sitting in a parked car. The inflammatory rhetoric on both sides, whether warranted or not will only continue to agitate the situation and events such as these will happen more and more. These are just my thoughts on the matter. Will continue to post more blogs on related subjects, as well any interesting thoughts I may have.”


(Kickass Torrents)


He added, “In case anyone’s wondering, I’m not on the side of the suspect, I’m on the side of the officer, and generally don’t agree with the black lives matter protests.”


In another post, titled, “The material world is a lie,” 


The material world is a lie. For so long we have been taught that what’s important in life is to buy this and have that. To always have the latest fashion, biggest tv, fanciest car, nicest house, and blah,blah, blah. Well, the truth is we’ve become so attached to these things, our spiritual development has been halted. Just like they say in fight club “We become owned by the things we own”. Most people will spend hours standing in front of stores just to buy a new iphone. Those same people will complain about how they don’t have enough money but will always have money to spend on apple products. This attachment produces so much of the stress and worrying in the world today. I used to be like that, always concerned about what clothes I had, rather than whether or not I was happy. But not anymore. Since then I have learned the truth that such attachments are falsehoods and will only bring misery.This is my first blog post, there will be more to come.


He also posted on the website that he has never had a girlfriend.


The blog matches his email address, ironcross45@gmail.com, which he used on his dating profiles.


A blog post allegedly written by reported Umpqua Community College gunman Chris Mercer Harper seems to idolize Vester Flanagan, the man who killed 2 WDBJ7 TV reporters on-camera.




5. The Internet Tore Apart an Innocent 4Chan Poster Whose Name & YouTube Videos Were Tied to the Shooting


(Google Maps)


Before the actual name of the shooter was released, a different name, Toby Reynolds, also known as Egg Man, spread on social media and some websites as the shooter.


He 
 and told them he was alive and not the shooter.


YouTube videos he posted spread quickly across the internet.


A
 Wednesday night at 7:19 p.m. local time that said “Some of you guys are alright. Don’t go to school tomorrow if you live in the northwest,” is being investigated as possibly connected to the shooting.


In the discussion thread, some users told him not to do it, while others encouraged him and gave him ideas for how he could kill people.


One person responded saying, “I suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire. Make sure that there is no way that someone can disarm you as it it possible. I suggest you carry a knife on your belt as last resort if someone is holding your gun.”


Another poster said, “You might want to target a girls school which is safer because there are no beta males throwing themselves for their rescue. Do not use a shotgun. I would suggest a powerful assault rifle and a pistol or 2x pistols. Possibly the type of pistols who have 15+ ammo.”


It’s not clear if the 4 Chan posts were connected to the actual shooter, Chris Harper Mercer.

Chris Harper Mercer is the alleged gunman who killed 10 at Umpqua Community College. But did he say he was going to on a shooting spree on 4Chan the night before?

he wasn’t a right wing anything….he was simply a murderer.  The fact that he asked if they were Christian before he killed them should make you take notice that his hate went far further than anything the media is spewing out.  His “dating site” may have said he was a conservative republican, but nothing about him ever represented that.  He acted more like a muslim terrorist than an actual human being.

The only good part is “he was”. At least he isn’t any longer. Lunatics like this one are the real reason colleges prohibit guns on campus, Every one of the students who were shot were perfectly safe at least as far as the facility’s safety was concerned, you don’t really think they were talking about the students safety do you? None of the victims harmed anyone at all.

Along the line of your speculation, many of the Muslim faith more than qualify as “conservative” but that doesn’t necessarily make them Republican or Democrat.  No, I am not insinuating that he was Muslim especially since he identified himself as non-religious.

I thought the Patriot Act was supposed to prevent stuff like this… I want to understand how tons of Isis sympathizers end up being tracked down before they leave the country or get even close to committing terrorist attacks, simply because of their online friends or posts indicating they are Isis sympathizers, but people like Dylan Roof (the Charleston Church shooter) and this whockjob can fully lay out their plans in blogs and no one does shit about it. Not that this guy laid out his plans necessarily, but Dylan did and whoever posted that 4Chan stuff should have homeland security busting into their houses. It seems that our government needs to remember that terrorists come in all colors and picking a certain demographic to zone in on is allowing stuff like this to happen.

This had nothing to do with him being treated differently.  He was different.  He went to a school for emotionally disturbed students.  He lives with his mother, and he has never had contact with a woman.  He is a loner and has sex issues..  He doesn’t believe in anything so what he does is of no consequence,  He said the more persons you kill, the more popular you will be.  This is another mental health issue, not a gun issue.

I figured he was a black guy because race was not mentioned. The rifle in the picture above appears to be a Ruger 10-22. If that was the rifle he used, it is not an AR-15 assault rifle. Now, if it had been a white guy killing Muslims, the liberal media would be having a field day. But a black guy killing Christians doesn’t fit the agenda and it will be played down. The police cannot get there in time so to disarm law abiding citizens and keep them from protecting themselves just doesn’t make sense. You can’t stop a killer by begging or throwing books. You have to return fire and save yourself and others. These anti-gun people are victims and they want everyone else to be a victim. One law abiding teacher or student with a licensed gun could have saved lives. The police will never get there on time because there isn’t enough time to get there. It’s the stupid gun laws that cause more victims. This should not so hard to understand.

Is anyone else getting tired of the shootings? In all honesty?


Let’s just everyone take a moment and stop talking about and glorifying the shooters. The shooters who keep actually getting the lime light, who get slaps in their wrists for “mental impairment” or “abusive childhoods” and see that murder is murder. There is nothing that’s going to reason these peoples lives back. Nothing is going to bring these people back because they are dead. And let’s honor and glorify them instead. Those beautiful people who lost their life to not a tragedy but an act of evil and violence. An outcome families have to deal with, that anyone of us could have to deal with. Let’s change society and media, let’s make a stance and voice and say we are done glorify that and honoring the people who were effected by evil.


Step two guns have the ability to kill in the wrong hands. No one knows the wrong hands. Yet a desire to keep guns shouldn’t be the point either. You shouldn’t need a gun to defend yourself. That should be the point you. Why should you have to fear for your life to the point your only choice in defense is killing someone else? The thing we should change is culture. This is where understanding people’s backgrounds are important. Why don’t we hold mothers and father accountable for loving a child a beautiful life? One just like you who needs love? Why don’t we affirm that kind of life? Why do we encourage The violence all around us? Why does society have to get to a breaking point where it boils over and by that time there’s already another shooting? 


This isn’t blowing steam or some made up utopia l. No doubt this is hard and seems so far right now. Yet it takes work. The best things in life take work. Do they not? Doesn’t a healthy marriage take work? To love your husband or wife? Doesn’t raising your kids take work? To sit with them and care about what they are doing? To want the best for them? So why wouldn’t this. Or have we all given up? Have we all lost hope on the matters that impact our lives and the loves around us.


God Please bless America

And America God bless you

We need it. You need it. I need it.

I don’t want to live my life looking over my shoulder. Do you?

It is a proven fact that criminals will stay away from places that allow guns or the carrying of guns and that the crime rate has dropped where citizens have a easier time obtaining a gun.  If a criminal has the option of robbing a business that has a gun vs a business without a gun, or a homeowner with a gun or the homeowner without the gun, who is he going to choose?  Now obama can not help himself, everytime he opens his mouth, he lies.  He said places that have the strictest gun laws are the safest.  Well obama, Illinois has the strictest gun laws which includes Chicago, which had 1000 murders last year, by guns.  Chicago crime is off the charts.  So try again Mr. Liar.  The problem is that people have no faith and so there are no consequences to their actions or they believe they will get virgins, or something else. What can you expect when we live in a country where babies are born alive and then cut up for their body parts, and people have no problem with that, or make excuses, like the videos were edited or not real.  You can not make that stuff up.

There it is again… Generalization of “liberals, Blue states, etc” just as there are MANY “levels” of conservative, right wing “Christians”, there are many of us in Oregon and abroad, who have belief in God, following the Catholic/Cristian ways, but also truly care about the Human population around the world. I despise what this man did, and many other have done. The problem is, that with most mass shootings, especially in this country, are NOT religion based. (There are those too) it just seems way to common and way to easy for the “right wing, conservatives” to blame liberals…. When that is your ONLY argument, it’s hard to believe that many of those people can see the actual bigger picture into what’s happening in this country. I find it disappointing, that no rational, helpful discussions and solutions can come from the people here in the UNITED states of America. So easy to point fingers, and rabidly blame liberals or conservatives, instead of working together to end this kind of thing in America…. One can hope that someday people here will learn of working together and learning to compromise for the better good of all of us.

The media needs to stop making these worthless a-holes into martyrs by telling their life history and putting their full name on every headline that mentions a shooting. There are a lot of nut jobs out there that are so desperate for attention that they see this as a way to be famous. If the media needs to put something out put out the victims names and tell how a lowlife good for nothing took their life. Stop giving his name and call him coward or criminal or idiot or just a POS because that is what he is.

On his dating profile Harper Mercer said he was a ‘conservative, republican’ who was spiritual and into the occult but didn’t like organised religion. Anastasia Boylan was in a class when he came in shooting. She said that he told some of his victims to stand up if they were Christian “because you are Christian you’re going to see God in about one second.” Atheists don’t believe that people see God if they die. Atheists don’t believe in the occult. One thing he clearly wasn’t was an Atheist.
