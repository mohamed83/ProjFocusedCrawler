 President Obama's Emotional Reaction to Oregon College Shooting



There's been another mass shooting in America. With Simon is. Community college and work. That means there are more American families. Moms dads and children. Whose lives have been changed forever. I means there's another communities stunned with grief. And communities across the country forced relieve their own anguish. And parents. Across the country. Who are scared because they know it might. Air France where there shall. I've been rose Byrd organ. They're really good people there. More thank all the first responders whose bravery and likely slipped save some lives today. Federal law enforcement has been on the scene in a supporting role and we've offered to stay and help as much as rose Burke needs for as long. In the coming bears will learn about the victims. Young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard. Their eyes set on the future. Dreams. On what they can make of their lives. And America world rapid everyone is grieving with their prayers and I'll. But. As I said. Just a few months ago. And I serie a few months before that and I serve each time we see one of these mass shootings. Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough. It does not capture. The heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted some place else in America. Next week. Or a couple months from now. We don't yet know why this individual did what he did. And it's fair to say that anybody who does this. It has a sickness. In their minds. Regardless of what they think their motivations may be. But we are not the only country on earth. And as people with mental illnesses. Or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings. Every few months. Earlier this year I answered a question in an interview by saying the United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth. In which we do not have sufficient common sense gun safety laws even in the face. Repeated mass killings. And later that day. There was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette Louisiana. The day. Somehow this has become retained. The reporting as routine. My response. Here. At this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become. Number two this. We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg after Tucson. After new town after a worry after Charleston. It cannot be this easy for somebody wants then flanked. Harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun. And what's become routine of course is the response. Of those who oppose any kind of common sense gun legislation. Right now I can imagine the press release is being cranked out. We need more guns Millard. Fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that. There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country I know that's not true. We know because polling. That says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws including. The majority of responsible law abiding gun owners. There is a gun for roughly. Every man woman and child in America. So how can you. With a straight face make the argument there. More guns will make us safer. We know that states with the most gun laws. Ten they have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work or just. Make it. Harder for law abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns not borne out by the evidence. We know that other countries in response took one man shoot. Have been able to craft laws. That. Almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours allies of ours. Great Britain. Australia. Countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it. And of course what's also routine is that somebody somewhere will comment. And say. Obama politicize this issue. Well this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our. Common life together to the body politic. I would asked news organizations because I won't put these facts forward. Have news organizations. Tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade. And the number of Americans who've been killed. My gun violence. And post both side by side on your news reports. This won't be information coming from me a will be coming from you. We spent over a trillion dollars. And passed countless laws and devote entire agencies to preventing. Terrorist attacks on hustle and rightfully so. And yet. We have a congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data. On. How we could. Potentially reduce gun deaths. How can let me. This is a political choice that we make. To allow this to happen. Every few months in America. We collectively are answerable to those parents who lose. Their loved ones. Because of our or an action. When Americans are killed in mine disasters we work to make mine say. When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes we make. Communities safe. When roads are unsafe. We fixed. To reduce. Auto Patel X. We have seat belt laws because we know. It saves lives. So the notion that. Gun violence is somehow different. That our freedom. And our constitution. Prohibits. Any. Modest. Regulation. Of how. We use a deadly weapon. When there law abiding gun owners all across the country who. Could hunt and protect their families and do everything they do under such regulations. Doesn't make sense. So. Tonight as. Those of us were lucky enough to hug orchids war closer. Or. Thinking about the families who. Aren't so fortunate. I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get. Our government to change these laws. And the save lives. And the let young people brought. And that will require a change of politics on this issue. And rule require that the American people. Individually. Whether you're a Democrat or a Republican or an independent. When you decide to vote for somebody. I'm making. A determination as to whether this. Cause of continuing death. For innocent people. Should be irrelevant factor in your decision. If you think this is a problem. And you should expect your elected officials to reflector abuse. And I were particularly ask. America's gun owners. War. Using those guns properly. Safely. Hunt. For sport. Four protecting their families. To think about whether your views are probably being represented. By the organization that put. Worked. Suggest speaking for you. And each time this happens I'm gonna bring this up. He signed this happens I'm going through say that we can actually do something about it. But we're gonna have to change girl's. And this is not something I can do my myself. I've got to have that congress and a granite state legislatures. And governors. Who are willing to work. Would mail us. I hope and pray. That I don't have to come out. Again. During my tenure as president. To offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as president I can't guarantee that. And that's terrible to say. I can change. May god bless the memories of those were killed today. Maybe bring comfort to their families. And courage to injured as they fight. Their way back. And may he give us the strength to come together. And find the courage. To change. Thank you.
