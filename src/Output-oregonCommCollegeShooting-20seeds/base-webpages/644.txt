Controlled chaos: How local heroes responded to college shooting

 County Commissioner Tim Freeman arrived at the county’s incident command center in Winchester 20 minutes after the first shots were fired Thursday morning at Umpqua Community College. 
 What Freeman saw were about 20 police cars and a dozen ambulances as first responders swarmed onto the scene, rapidly taking control of a chaotic situation. It drove home just how bad the situation was. 
 “It was sort of terrifying,” Freeman said. 
 Freeman said he witnessed an “incredible, organized response” tragic situation.  
 “Law enforcement officers, EMS and others responded in a very amazing way. They got there quickly, they secured the campus, they systematically went through the rooms and made sure everybody was safe. They got transportation and got them to a safe location,” Freeman said. “It was just an amazing response from really very dedicated and very well prepared public safety officers.” 
 According to Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, more than 100 officers and other rescue workers responded to the incident. Two “heroic” officers entered the building and exchanged gunfire with the shooter, Hanlin said at a press conference Thursday evening. After the shooter had been killed and students bused to safety, bomb squads scoured the buildings, going through every room to make sure all was safe. No explosive devices were found. 
 Searches of the many cars abandoned on campus were scheduled for today.  
 Mercy Medical Center received a call shortly after the shooting began. They had 10 minutes to get ready. 
 That was plenty of time, according to Chief Nursing Officer Debbie Boswell. 
 By the time the first of the 10 wounded victims came in, the hospital had its own command center up and operating. The staff was ready. Extra blood was secured from blood banks, and resources were quantified — available staff, beds, supplies. 
 It’s a scenario for which hospital staff drill regularly, but this is the first time they’ve put that practice to use. 
 What was it like? 
 “I think the best way to describe it is controlled chaos,” said Chief Medical Officer Jason Gray. 
 Gray said three of the 10 wounded patients were immediately transferred to Sacred Heart Hospital at RiverBend in Springfield. Two were treated and released. Four were taken to the emergency room. Of those, three were in stable condition Thursday evening and one was in critical condition. One patient died in the hospital. 
 All of the injuries were due to gunshot wounds. The location of the wounds ranged from extremities to the abdomen. 
 All four patients remaining at the hospital are expected to survive, Gray said. 
 Mercy CEO Kelly Morgan said he’s proud of the hospital staff, whose response to the tragedy he called “nothing short of amazing.” 
 Staff members came in on their days off to help. Hospitals around the country sent pizza and flowers to the staff.  
 “It’s been absolutely fantastic the support we’ve gotten here locally but also nationwide,” Morgan said. 
 Gray said initially everyone was in a state of disbelief that something like this could happen in this community. But they moved quickly from emotion to action, doing what needed to be done to stabilize the patients. It’s the next few days that will be difficult for the staff, he said. It will take time to process the tragedy and heal. 
 Roseburg Veterans Affairs Medical Center took in Mercy hospice patients so that Mercy could make room for the shooting victims, according to VA spokesman Shawn Clark. 
 Clark said VA doctors and staff were available to help however they were needed. One staff member served as a translator for a Spanish-speaking family who was waiting at the Douglas County Fairgrounds to find out whether their student was OK.
