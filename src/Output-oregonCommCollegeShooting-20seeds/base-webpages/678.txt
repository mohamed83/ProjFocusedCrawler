President Obama said he and his wife are praying for the victims of Friday's shootings in Binghamton, their families and the people of Binghamton.


BADEN-BADEN, Germany -- President Barack Obama says he is shocked and saddened by the deadly mass shooting in Binghamton.


Authorities say a gunman opened fire at an immigration services center there on Friday, killing at least 13 people before he turned the gun on himself.


Obama called it an "act of senseless violence."


The president, who is traveling in Europe, says he and his wife, Michelle, are praying for the victims, their families and the people of Binghamton.


The administration is monitoring the situation. Vice President Joe Biden also has been in touch with New York Gov. David Paterson and local officials to track developments.
