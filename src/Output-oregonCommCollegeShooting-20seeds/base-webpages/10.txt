			Shooting In Oregon: 15 Dead And 20 Inured In UCC Shooting At Umpqua Community College					










UCC Shooting Update
 – A female witness to the shooting said the gunman began firing from outside the building and then entered the classroom. She said the gunman ordered everyone to stand and state their religion before aiming the gun and firing, the 
 reports. The 18-year-old woman said she stood by helpless, as she saw the man shoot her teacher in the head.


Umpqua Community College Shooting Update
 – John Hanlin, Douglas County Sheriff, stated during a press conference that that the gunman in the Oregon shooting is deceased. Sheriff Hanlin did not elaborate on the cause of death. The name of the gunman has not yet been released. The sheriff was not able to release an exact count of the injured or the death toll during the ongoing press conference.


Shooting in Oregon Update
 – Roseburg police are now reporting that the UCC shooting was confined to a single classroom. The White House has already called for more stringent gun laws in the wake of the Umpqua Community College shooting. Second Amendment advocates were quick to point out that the Roseburg, Oregon school was a “gun free zone” and feel that perhaps some of the students could have survived if a staff member or student had been permitted to carry a handgun on campus. The White House has come under criticism on social media for the decision to enter into a gun control debate so quickly in the wake of the tragedy. No details are yet known about the identity of the shooter or a possible motive in the horrific school shooting.


UCC Shooting Update
 — Local officials have now confirmed that 15 people are dead in the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon. No details about the alleged gunman, or a motive for the shooting, have yet emerged. Multiple ambulances have arrived on campus and are in the midst of transporting all the wounded and dead from the Douglas County campus. Students and staff are reportedly still sheltering in place inside their classrooms and offices.

A shooting at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon has left 20 injured and 15 students feared dead, according to breaking news reports. Some developing news reports indicate that the shooter is among the dead and acted alone, other media reports vary and state that the shooter has been arrested. The Oregon community college is currently still on lockdown.




The Douglas County Sheriff’s Office told 
 that police responded to a report of a shooting on campus at Umpqua Community College (UCC) at 10:30 a.m. local time. A tweet by a local fire department stated that an “active shooter” was on the loose at the campus and cautioned residents to “please stay away from the area.”
