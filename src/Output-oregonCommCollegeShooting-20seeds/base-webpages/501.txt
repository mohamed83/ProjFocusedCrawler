 (CNN)
During his presidency, President Barack Obama has had to deliver statements on gun violence 15 times. 
After a gunman opened fire at Oregon's Umpqua Community College, killing nine people and injuring seven, a 
 the shootings were becoming all too routine. 
The gunman also died, although it's unclear whether he was shot by police or committed suicide. 
"The reporting is routine," he said. "My response here at this podium ends up being routine, the conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this."
He then asked news organizations to tally up the number of Americans killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and compare it with the number of Americans who have died in gun violence. 
Using numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we found that from 2004 and 2013, 
316,545 
people
 died by firearms on U.S. soil. (2013 is the most recent year CDC data for deaths by firearms is available.) This data covered all manners of death, including homicide, accident and suicide.
According to the U.S. State Department, the number of U.S. citizens killed 
overseas
 as a result of incidents of terrorism from 2004 to 2013 was 
277
. 
In addition, we compiled all terrorism incidents 
inside
 the U.S.* and found that between 2004 and 2013, there were 
36 people
 killed in domestic acts of terrorism. This brings the total to 
313.
