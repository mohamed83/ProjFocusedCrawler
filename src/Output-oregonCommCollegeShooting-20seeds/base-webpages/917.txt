Cover Oregon enrollments top 200,000 people

				Cover Oregon hosted enrollment fairs Thursday, March 27 and Friday, March 28  (KOIN)			






SALEM, Ore. (AP) – Oregon’s troubled health insurance exchange says more than 200,000 people have now signed up for health coverage through Cover Oregon.


Numbers released Thursday show that just under 59,000 people have signed up for coverage from a private insurance company. The rest enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan, the state’s version of Medicaid, a publicly funded health plan for people with low income.


Oregon is the only state where the general public still can’t enroll online in health coverage in one sitting. The state is using a hybrid enrollment process that allows people to perform some functions online but still requires Cover Oregon staff to process part of the application.


Another 131,000 people have signed up for the Oregon Health Plan through a separate process that bypasses Cover Oregon.


Concerns over privacy of information


A congressional committee is looking into whether Cover Oregon did enough to protect user’s identities using the Cover Oregon portal in October.


In a letter to Gov. John Kitzhaber, the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform outlined data security concerns at state-built exchanges which connected to the federal data hub before full review and security approval.


Oregon and five other states were questioned by the committee on Thursday.


According to The Oregonian, Cover Oregon says it still has not received final federal approval of its data safeguards. The exchange received preliminary approvals in September.


A September security assessment shows part of the exchange’s required security testing remained unfinished.


Cover Oregon says the site has had no electronic security breaches.
