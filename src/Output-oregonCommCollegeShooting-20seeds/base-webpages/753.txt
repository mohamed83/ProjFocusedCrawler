This story has been updated










Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin did not identify Mercer as the gunman during a press conference on Thursday evening. The shooter died at the scene after exchanging gunfire with authorities.


CBS also 
 that four firearms, including a rifle and pistols, were recovered from the scenes. The purported gunman was originally described as being 20 years old by Gov. Kate Brown during a statement earlier in the day. 


Update, 10:23 p.m. EST:
 Hanlin said at a press conference later in the evening that he would not confirm the gunman’s identity, saying he would not give him the attention he wanted.


“You will never hear me mention the shooter’s name,” Hanlin said.


Update, 9:49 p.m. EST:
 
 that 
 registered under the name Chris Harper Mercer is listed as being in Torrance, California. However, Mercer and his mother reportedly moved to Winchester, Oregon, about four miles away from the Umpqua campus in Roseburg. 


Mercer’s page also contained several photos promoting the Irish Republican Army, as seen below:
