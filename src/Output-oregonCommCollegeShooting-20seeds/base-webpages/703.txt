President Barack Obama spoke passionately and registered frustration Thursday night after a gunman opened fire on a community college campus in Oregon. Watch his remarks here. (Published Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015)




President Barack Obama spoke passionately and registered frustration Thursday night after a gunman opened fire on a community college campus in Oregon.


The shooter, Chris Harper Mercer, 26, who is now dead, killed nine people at the community college in Roseburg and wounded about seven others.




"Somehow this has become routine," Obama said. "My response here, at this podium, is routine. We’ve become numb to this. It cannot be this easy for someone who wants to inflict pain on someone else to get their hands on guns.”












Shooting at Oregon Community College






The president called upon Congress to implement what he called common sense gun control laws. He noted that critics will say that he had "politicized" the issue.


"This is something we should politicize— it is relevant to our common life together," he said.

Obama compared the United States to other advanced countries, saying that their gun policies were changed after only "one mass shooting." States with more gun control laws have less gun violence, he said.


The president also said that the United States was not the only country with people with mental illness but that it was the only developed country that sees shootings like this "every month."




Obama added that "our thoughts and prayers are not enough."


Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee criticized Obama in a statement on Facebook, saying that his "passion is grossly misplaced into destroying the Second Amendment" and that gun violence is "the fault of evil people doing evil things."




"With few facts, Obama is quick to admittedly politicize this tragedy to advance his liberal, anti-gun agenda," Huckabee wrote. "For this president to make a political pronouncement is at best premature and at worst ignorantly inflammatory."
