There have been several reports throughout the day that the Oregon school shooter asked people if they were Christians or not before firing.


First there was this account from student 
Kortney Moore
 
:


Kortney Moore, 18, from Rogue River, was in her Writing 115 class in Snyder Hall when one shot came through a window. She saw her teacher get shot in the head. The shooter was inside at that point, and he told people to get on the ground. The shooter was asking people to stand up and state their religion and then started firing away, Moore said. Moore was lying there with people who had been shot.


The New York Post
 followed up with 
 on an account someone tweeted out:


“The shooter was lining people up and asking if they were Christian,” she wrote. “If they said yes, then they were shot in the head. If they said no, or didn’t answer, they were shot in the legs. My grandma just got to my house, and she was in the room. She wasn’t shot, but she is very upset.”


Local news reporter 
David Jaques
 corroborated that same account on Fox News tonight.
