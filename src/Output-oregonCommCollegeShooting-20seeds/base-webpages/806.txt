I hate guys like these…I am a failed this, I failed at that and it’s all because I am black and whitey wants to keep us down blah blah blah.  He probably got the chance to be on TV because of being black not in spite of it.  Seems to happen the most with blacks.

EEOC is incompetent. How many years did it take them to get on his complaint?

This man was obviously mentall ill, and sadly for some reason identified with other mentally ill people that were also murderers. In my opinion anyone that wants to go out and shoot other people is mentally ill in some way or another. Whether they are acting and claiming racism they are first and foremost mentally ill and there thinking is flawed in some way or another.   The fact that he calls himself a powder keg in his manifesto is pretty telling.  The fact that he identified with Mass murderers.
