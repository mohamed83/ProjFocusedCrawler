CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) - As the families of four Marines and a sailor shot to death in Chattanooga grieved their losses Saturday, the family of the man authorities say pulled the trigger offered sympathy, condolences and prayers.
 




The statement, provided to the Associated Press by a lawyer representing the family of Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez says, "There are no words to describe our shock, horror, and grief. The person who committed this horrible crime was not the son we knew and loved. For many years, our son suffered from depression. It grieves us beyond belief to know that his pain found its expression in this heinous act of violence."
 
The family added that they are cooperating with the investigation.
 




 
That statement came Saturday hours after the deadly toll from Thursday's attacks rose to five when a sailor died of his wounds.
