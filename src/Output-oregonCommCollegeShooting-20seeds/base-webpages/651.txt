Alison Parker was interviewing Vicki Gardner when Vester Lee Flanagan opened fire, killing the broadcast journalist and her camerman.
 
 
 
 

	The Virginia woman who survived the live-on-TV shooting that killed a reporter and cameraman says she was convinced the gunman was going to execute her.



	Speaking publicly for the first time, Vicki Gardner says she was lying on the ground preparing for the worst after WDBJ-TV reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward were shot Aug. 26.



	“I didn’t know where he was,” Gardner, 62, told “On the Record w/Greta Van Susteren” in an interview Tuesday night. “I saw movement and then, gunfire. Lots and lots of gunfire. From that point, it was very chaotic.”


 
 
 
 
 







	Gardner had dropped to the ground after the shooter, Vester Lee Flanagan, targeted Parker and Ward.



	“The only thing I could think of was ‘play dead,’ ” Gardner said. “I just fell to the ground as though I had been hit.”



	Parker, 24, and Ward, 27, were interviewing Gardner, the executive director of the Roanoke Chamber of Commerce, at the Smith Mountain Lake Visitor Center when Flanagan ambushed them.



	Flanagan ended up striking Gardner in the back. She thought that was the end.

	“I knew, the next shot, he was just gonna shoot me in the head, because that was what he was doing,” she said. “When he shot me in the back, I said, ‘I’m gonna be paralyzed, darn. And then, I waited. “They say the world goes in front of you, and it did real fast, and I said, ‘I’m ready, I’m ready.”



	But there was no next shot. Flanagan had fled, and police arrived within minutes.



	Gardner, who is expected to make a full recovery, said she watched the horrific video of the shooting.



	“So that I can put my mind at peace that I’m not conjuring up something that wasn’t,” she said. “You can’t take this and bury it. It’ll be a long path. I need to watch it.”



	The 41-year-old Flanagan, a disgruntled ex-employee of WDBJ-TV in Roanoke, fired a total of 17 shots from a Glock pistol, authorities said.



	He fatally shot himself in the head after a police chase.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Flanagan was a disgruntled former reporter at  the television station, a job he was fired from two years ago.

Parker and cameraman Adam Ward died on the scene.
 
 
 

	Flanagan, left, a reporter for the TV station who was fired two years ago, shot and killed his former co-workers Parker and Adam Ward.


 







	“We have a long way to go on understanding what would possess somebody to have that much anger,” Gardner said of the gunman.
