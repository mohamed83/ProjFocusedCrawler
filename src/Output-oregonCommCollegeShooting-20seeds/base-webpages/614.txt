ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) — The latest on the deadly shooting Thursday at a community college in Oregon (all times local):
5:45 p.m.
Officials at Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg, Oregon, say four people injured in a deadly mass shooting remain hospitalized there but are expected to survive.
Dr. Jason Gray, chief medical officer, says three other patients were transferred to a hospital in Springfield.
Gray says one of the four people still at Mercy Medical Center is in critical condition and the others are stable.
He says some of the victims who were taken to the hospital suffered multiple gunshot wounds.
They were injured when a gunman opened fire at Umpqua (UHMP'-kwah) Community College.
5:05 p.m.
A sheriff says 10 people were killed in a shooting at an Oregon community college.
Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin says 10 dead and another seven injured is the "best, most accurate information we have at this time."
Earlier, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said 13 people were killed in the rampage at Umpqua (UHMP'-kwah) Community College in Roseburg.
It's unclear what led to the discrepancy. Hanlin has said the gunman died after a shootout with police. He didn't clarify whether the shooter was included in the 10 fatalities.
Hanlin says three people who were critically injured in the shooting have been transferred to hospitals in the Eugene area.
4:45 p.m.
The sheriff overseeing the investigation of an Oregon college shooting has been vocal in opposing state and federal gun-control legislation.
Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin registered his opposition this year as state lawmakers considered requiring background checks on private, person-to-person gun sales.
Hanlin told a legislative committee in March that a background-check mandate wouldn't prevent criminals from getting firearms.
He said the state should combat gun violence by cracking down on convicted criminals found with guns, and by addressing people with unmanaged mental health issues.
Hanlin also sent a letter to Vice President Joe Biden in 2013, after the shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school. Hanlin said he and his deputies would refuse to enforce new gun-control restrictions "offending the constitutional rights of my citizens."
4:35 p.m.
A student at an Oregon community college where a deadly mass shooting happened says she was in a writing class when her teacher got a call from security saying the school was on lockdown.
Hannah Miles is a 19-year-old freshman at Umpqua (UHMP'-kwah) Community College in Roseburg.
She says she heard gunshots from a neighboring classroom Thursday, and her teacher and fellow students huddled together in their locked classroom.
She says they heard footsteps outside, and a man's voice call out to them, "Come on out, come on out." They remained quiet and didn't open the door.
Miles says police soon arrived. And after students were convinced they were indeed officers, they opened the door.
Miles says seeing the officers was "like a huge burden had been lifted."
The shooting left 13 people dead and more than a dozen injured.
4:10 p.m.
Royals left-hander Jeremy Guthrie says he's keeping his Oregon hometown in his prayers after a mass shooting at a local community college.
Guthrie was born in Roseburg and lived there until he was 12. But he moved just 100 miles away and visited there often after he left. His father sold cars in the community for about 20 years.
"I used to ride around that entire town on my bicycle," he said before the Royals faced the White Sox in Chicago. "When we went somewhere, we jumped on our bikes and rode down to the shoe store, the mall, and as such you got to know people."
Guthrie says he has several cousins, aunts and uncles who still live in the Roseburg area.
"Certainly in those smaller towns everybody knows each other, so I'm sure there are many people that are directly feeling the pain today," he said.
4 p.m.
Vice President Joe Biden is predicting investigators will find that a semi-automatic or automatic weapon was used in the Oregon college shooting.
Biden is speaking at a global summit in New York. He says it's still too early to know all the details, but he's basing his guess on the large number of people killed and injured.
The vice president is renewing his call for what describes as "sane gun legislation." He says the Second Amendment doesn't allow someone to own a bazooka.
Biden says there's almost nothing worse than getting a phone call saying, "Your child is gone." He's alluding to his own son's brain cancer death earlier this year.
Biden spoke after 13 people were killed by a 20-year-old gunman at Umpqua (UHMP'-kwah) Community College in Roseburg.
3:40 p.m.
President Barack Obama says the U.S. is becoming numb to mass shootings and says their perpetrators have "sickness" in their minds.

A spokeswoman at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland says they hadn't heard of any patients transported there, but said that could change.

2:30 p.m.

Clinton said after a Dorchester, Massachusetts, campaign event that the nation needs to "get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe."
