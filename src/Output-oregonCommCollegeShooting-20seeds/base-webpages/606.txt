                    White House expresses frustration on gun control after Oregon shooting

Authorities reported multiple fatalities Thursday in the aftermath of a shooting at Umpqua Community College outside Roseburg, Oregon, some 180 miles south of Portland — the latest in a series of mass shootings that have attracted much attention but little policy response over the past few years. 


Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum told MSNBC that 13 have died and more than 20 were injured. Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin confirmed that the shooter, a male, is also dead.

As the news broke in Washington, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said during the daily briefing that the issue of gun control has not fallen on the administration's priority list, but that President Barack Obama is "quite realistic that we'll need to see a fundamental change in terms of the way the American people communicate this priority to Congress before we'll see a different outcome in the legislative process."


"We've not yet seen that kind of strong bipartisan support across the country translate into legislative support in the United States Congress that's sufficient to pass legislation that would, again, implement these kinds of common-sense solutions," Earnest told reporters.





























            By 














On the campaign trail, presidential candidates tweeted their prayers for the southwest Oregon college of 3,000 students, the victims of the shooting and their families.
