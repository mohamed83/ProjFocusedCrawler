Chris Harper-Mercer, 26, is believed to be the man who opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon.
 
 
 
 

	The gunman who slaughtered nine people at an Oregon community college Thursday was a 26-year-old loner introvert with a disdain for organized religion who lived with his fiercely protective mother.



	Police shot and killed Chris Harper Mercer after his 
 in Roseburg, officials said.



	Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said he wouldn't name the shooter because “I will not give him the credit he probably sought” at 
.



	Yet the profile of the shooter who reportedly demanded that his victims state their religions before firing on them began to take shape through news reports and Mercer’s apparent online profiles.







	His social media paints a picture of someone who admired Irish Republican Army fighters, thought a great deal about America's mass killings and may have even revealed hints about the community college massacre.

A photo from the apparent MySpace profile of Chris Harper Mercer shows the man authorities identified as the Oregon community college shooter posing with a rifle.
 
 
 



	“He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,” a law enforcement official
.



	Rosario Lucumi, who rode the same city bus as Mercer, said the 26-year-old shared a small one-bedroom apartment with his mother, Laurel Harper.



	“He and his mother were really close,” she revealed to the Times. “They were always together.”



	Neighbors said Harper went to great lengths to shield her son from ordinary annoyances. She once started a petition demanding the landlord do a better extermination job in the complex because its cockroaches were “really irritating” Mercer.

	She frequently complained about another mother’s playing children, whose giggles and calls bothered her son, neighbors said.



	Mercer brought at least three weapons — handguns and at least one larger firearm — with him to the 10:38 a.m. killing in the town about 180 miles south of Portland, officials said. He was carrying enough bullets for a prolonged gunfight and body armor, 
. Nine people died and seven others were wounded when Mercer opened fire.



	At least two police officers who rushed to the community college killed the gunman in a shootout, Sheriff Hanlin told reporters. He praised the officers’ heroism but sought to keep Mercer out of the headlines.



	“I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,” Hanlin said of his avoidance of Mercer’s name. “We would encourage media and the community to avoid using it, repeating it, or engaging in any glorification and sensationalization of him.



	"He in no way deserves it," Hanlin added. "Focus your attention on the victims and their families and helping them to recover.”

Mercer had a profile on a dating website for spiritual singles, using the screenname "IRONCROSS45."

TRANSCRIPT: OBAMA ADDRESSED NATION AFTER OREGON SHOOTING



	Those victims had been forced to say their religions at gunpoint before Mercer fired on them, according to widely-cited eyewitness accounts.



	“The shooter was lining people up and asking if they were Christian,” according to a Twitter user who said a relative had survived the shooting.”If they said yes, then they were shot in the head. If they said no, or didn't answer, they were shot in the legs.”



	The accounts of the shooting have raised questions about what may have possessed Mercer to engage in the brutal act. Mercer was born in England and moved to the U.S. when he was young, according to reports 
. 



	Mercer “seemed really unfriendly,” said Bronte Hart, who noticed a woman she believed was his mother “crying her eyes out.”
 
 
 



	Hart said Mercer often would “sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light.”




11 OF THE BLOODIEST SCHOOL SHOOTINGS SINCE COLUMBINE



	The shooter’s apparent social media profiles started to go viral, especially a photo of Mercer posing with a rifle on 
. The page also praised the paramilitary Irish separatists known as the IRA.



	Masked IRA soldiers carrying assault rifles down a back alley in one picture were “looking cool defending their country,” Mercer wrote. He had also posted a left wing Irish republican newspaper headline that said, “British army could not defeat IRA.”



	“Yeah,” he wrote underneath. “It’s true.”
 
 
 
 
 
 




 from the religious singles site Spiritual Passions also may hold some clues. Mercer identified himself as an “introvert” and “teetotaller” who was “not religious, not religious, but spiritual.” He called himself mixed race, a conservative Republican and said he was “always dieting.”



	The profile is titled "IRONCROSS45," which could be a reference to the German military medal last used by Nazi troops in World War II.



	A blog that has been linked to him was last updated on Wednesday with an uploaded documentary on the 
 in Newtown, Conn., 
. In another post, he discussed Vester Lee Flanagan, the shooter who 
 in August.



	"I have noticed that so many people like [Flanagan] are alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are," Mercer wrote. "A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems like the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight."



	And 
 on the anonymous web forum 4chan may well have telegraphed the attack. Federal officials are investigating whether the posts are connected with the shooting,
