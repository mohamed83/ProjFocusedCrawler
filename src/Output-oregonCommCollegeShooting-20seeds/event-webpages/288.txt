“Clearly they’re just trying to protect the officer. And they’re coming up with a lot of excuses to get around the big question ‘why the officer shot an unarmed man several times?’


This is the frustration Rasheen Aldridge, a student at Saint Louis Community College-Forest Park, expressed to USA Today College moments after the Chief of Ferguson Police Department Thomas Jackson released details surrounding the death of Ferguson’s unarmed black teen Michael Brown.


Chief Jackson spoke at a news conference last Friday afternoon and revealed more details about the incident, including the name of the officer who shot Brown — Darren Wilson, a six-year vet who has no disciplinary actions on his record — and that Brown and a friend were allegedly involved in a robbery at a convenience store shortly before the shooting. 


These new details conflict a report the Chief made at a press conference Friday morning. At the time, Chief Jackson stated that Wilson responded to a 911 call about a robbery, and he [Wilson] believed Brown fits the suspect’s description and location. Friday afternoon, the police chief reversed this statement and said Brown was stopped because “he was walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.”


“If he did rob the store, that’s totally wrong,” said Aldridge. “But why shoot him eight times? And even if there was a scuffle, why not shoot him in his leg. There’s no justification for shooting him eight times, and again the officer didn’t know he [Brown] was in an alleged robbery.”


Brown, 18, was shot eight times just days before he was bound to start Vatterott College. His death resonated nationwide, including on college campuses miles away, where students have been expressing their outrage. 




Last Wednesday, a student from Howard University 
 that appears to show hundreds of students showing their solidarity with Brown and protesters in Ferguson. They stood together with their hands raised, a universal sign of surrender. At least three witnesses said Brown assumed that posture shortly before he was shot.


“The media is putting the ones grieving the loss on trial, by the way they were reacting (in response to violent protests and lootings that happened Monday night). So we chose to do something peaceful and powerful for us to get back in touch with the real issue. And also for the media to circulate that message,” Director of Student Advocacy for Howard University Student Association and one of the photo organizers, Khalil Saadiq told USA Today College.


Saadiq asserted that his institution “has a long track record for being on the forefront of social activism,” and that students were receptive to the idea of the group photo.


“They all rushed to the auditorium to be a part of it. You could actually feel the intensity in the room,” he added. 


Asked about his personal feeling about the teen’s death, he said, “I hate to say, but this is just repetitive. It’s nothing new that the lives of African-Americans are not valued in this nation. It’s time to make changes happen.”

Solidarity was also showed by a a group of 20 law students at Harvard School of Law. A picture surfaced online recently, shows students with the hands-raised posture. Jonathan Wall, a second year student at the law school, was a part of it.


“Even though our suits and ties don’t make us any less of a target, we are the next generation of lawyers and legal architects as we think about how to dismantle the systematic barriers to equal opportunity,” said Wall, an aspiring civil rights attorney. “We want to be at the forefront making changes.”


On Friday, Wall and other members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, launched a civil rights campaign, #HandsUpDontShoot. 


The campaign is part of the group’s P.U.L.S.E. initiative (Powerfully Utilizing Law School Educations for Political and Social Justice), which seeks to track, report and respond to developing social issues that affects the America’s black community. 


The group also released a statement to send their condolences to Brown’s family and other “unarmed victims of police brutality,” and urged Eric Holder to ensure  an independent and transparent investigation of incident.  


Wall said he finds the militarization of the police “disheartening” and that the country should acknowledge that “justice is being administered in a discriminatory way.”


“This is something my grandmother would tell be about, in reference to the civil right’s era,” he added. “It just a glimpse of the past that some might believed we’ve overcome.”


@WhoISdeante/Twitter #IfTheyGunnedMeDown which photo would they use?


The #IfIWereGunnedDown hashtag has been the center of discussion among many students on twitter since Brown’s death. They argued that mainstream media often use photos of black victims to make them seem more hostile. 


In Brown’s case, the media uses a photo of him showing two fingers. It appears to be a gang sign or a peace sign. The hashtag generated thousands of tweets, where contributors post photos of themselves: a photo in “gangsta” gesture, smoking or drinking, and the other showing them professionally dressed or in graduation gowns. 


“Look at the pictures the media used for the guy who shoot-up the theater in Colorado and the ones they used for Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Jordan Davis. There’s a huge comparison,” argued Ikenna Ikeotuonye, vice president of the Howard University Student Association. “He [Brown] just graduated from high school, so why cant see more of that? It just the stigma that the media places on us. It upsets me.”


Saadiq said Howard University Student Association plans to host a HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) conference entitled “Democracy in Action.” 


Slated for September 17th-21st, students will convene to talk about about gun violence, the voting rights acts and political engagement, among other issues.


While in St. Louis, Aldridge continues to protest peacefully with residents and members of Young Activists United St. Louis. It is a social justice organization that is run by local college students of color in Missouri. Aldridge, who is the director of the group, said he’s happy to see young people getting more engaged in the peaceful protests “even though officers are aggressive towards them.”
