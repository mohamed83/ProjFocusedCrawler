NEW BRUNSWICK – As the investigation continues into Sunday’s death of a 19-year-old Rutgers University sophomore, which authorities said may be an alcohol-related, several students on the College Avenue campus late Sunday afternoon expressed sadness over the death.


“I heard what happened about 20 minutes ago,” Rutgers student Matt Rivera, 20, said. “I didn’t know her, but hearing about a death at Rutgers is always surprising. It’s really sad.”


Caitlyn P. Kovacs of the Monmouth Junction section of South Brunswick was pronounced dead at 3:19 a.m. at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, according to a news release issued by Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey, Chief Kenneth Cop of the Rutgers University Police Department, and Anthony A. Caputo, director of the New Brunswick Police Department.


Police began the investigation after hospital officials called at 3:28 a.m. to alert them to the student’s death.
