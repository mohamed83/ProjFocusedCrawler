COURTESY OF KYLE PLANTZ


Student journalism isn’t dead and neither are newspapers.


This is something that I constantly say to prospective families when I give campus tours at Boston University. “Why are you studying journalism? It’s a dying field.” No it’s actually not dead, thank you very much. Journalism is very much alive and there are several opportunities for people who are passionate about the career and bring something new to the field.


I just witnessed the love and passion that people have for journalism this past week. 
 at which I am the editor-in-chief, 
 to pay off our debt to our publisher, Turley Publications, or else we wouldn’t be able to print next semester. As an independent newspaper, we don’t receive any funding from BU and all of the costs come out of pocket. As students, it can be difficult to do that on our own, but just like other media outlets, we are learning from our mistakes and we are figuring out how our old print model can adapt to the digital world.


I thought this campaign would go right up to the deadline, with those last tweets, Facebook posts and e-mails, asking people to support us one last time to reach our goal. I was very wrong.


The campaign lasted two days — less than 48 hours actually — and we surpassed our goal and raised more than $82,000. We closed the GoFundMe on Nov. 12, but we knew there were still people who did not donate yet but wanted to. 
, so anyone who wanted to still donate to the FreeP, had an outlet to do that.


We received donations from current staff members, friends and family of people in the office and of course, our alumni came out strong and donated whatever they could. We did have two large donations from high-profile donors, including FreeP (which we are affectionately known as) and BU alum Bill O’Reilly. The political talk show host donated $10,000 to his former college paper. The support from O’Reilly was incredible. As a notable member in the journalism world, his support speaks volumes and I am glad he still finds value in the work we do.


But then, from out of the blue and completely unexpected, Ernie Boch Jr., president and CEO of Subaru of New England, donated $50,000 to help finish our campaign. After receiving the call from his publicist, Peggy Rose, that Boch wanted to donate, I basically had to sit on the floor. Why would someone who is not known in the journalism community want to donate to our college paper? It didn’t make sense. But after further reflection, our two large donors really sum up the reach of our campaign and the power of student journalism.


Our alumni came out when we needed them most. It was amazing to see all the donations from FreeP-ers past, from all decades since we formed in 1970. Although we made several changes over the years, it’s nice to know that we still have all those who have come before us, to support the work we are doing. Especially with O’Reilly, when I talked with him on the phone with our chairman of the Board of Directors, Tyler Lay, he said he remembered all the good times at the FreeP. Even someone like O’Reilly had to get his start somewhere and just like most professional journalists, they got their start at their college paper.


Boch’s donation represents the people who don’t have a direct impact by student journalism every day. The parents and friends and friends of friends who donated just wanted to do something nice for a FreeP-er they knew. Boch saw a cause that he felt was worthy and wanted to help us out. The fact that we are able to reach those people who aren’t associated with journalism goes to show how important student journalism can be to the community it covers.


I was not expecting to raise this money in two days. Nor was I expecting to receive such large donations from people. But I am completely honored and humbled to say that I work for an organization that has the power to reach so many people. I also get to work with some amazing journalists and incredible people. Their hard work and dedication are the reason I keep coming back and stay driven in this chaotic profession.
