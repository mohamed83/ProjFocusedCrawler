You might not be on Yik Yak, but your campus police likely are

You may not see campus police checking smartphone apps, but that doesn’t meant they’re unaware of the latest popular social media platforms.


Yik Yak, a social media app that allows users to create anonymous posts using up to 200 characters, has become 
 among college students since its November 2013 launch. But it’s also become one of many social media resources campus police use in criminal investigations.


“Yik Yak does cooperate with law enforcement if it looks like an immediate threat, so being anonymous isn’t always necessarily truly anonymous,” says Rick Tupper, director of campus safety at Augustana College in Sioux Falls, S.D.

 includes a provision on disclosing user information in order to “comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena or other legal process.” This means  Yik Yak has the power to share IP addresses, location information or other information, though only in response to “immediate” threats, according to Tupper.


“We had one case on our campus in which a mother saw a Yik Yak comment about what somebody wanted to do sexually to her daughter,” Tupper says. “There’s not a lot that can be done with it.”


But that’s not to say Yik Yak is the only social media outlet used by campus police to gather information.


“A lot of these apps talk about anonymity, and there are some things that you can remain anonymous with,” says Marc Lovicott, a public information officer at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. “But a lot of these apps, we’re able to track down individuals through different means.”


At Wisconsin, social media has been “really helpful” in solving campus crimes, Lovicott says.


“Social media does help us when we’re trying to follow that roadmap of a crime to figure out what happened when and who was involved,” Lovicott says.


When it comes to conducting an investigation, Tupper says social media posts can help officers understand the intent behind the crime.


“During the investigation, I’ll go to one of the involved parties and ask them if they can provide me copies of whatever tweets or Facebook posts or e-mails – anything that they’ve got that would show part of the investigation,” Tupper says.


According to Augustana’s associate director of campus life, Whitney Brown, the college’s use of social media in response to student safety concerns stems in part from the 
. It states that a college “must establish a missing student notification policy” to alert on-campus students of any student missing for 24 hours, which includes social media.


“This allows campuses to use [social media] immediately as a way to find information out about a student,” Brown says.


Lovicott says the university police department’s emergency alert system automatically posts to social media. The department also posts safety reminders for students.


Social media can also be used as a public relations tool, according to Lovicott, to share human-interest stories and various safety messages.


He says one benefit of social media usage is its “humanization” of the police department and “creating an environment in which our officers are approachable and we portray our image as positive.”


Tupper says officers at Augustana are encouraged to monitor publicly accessible social media sites to see what’s happening on and around campus, but no one can watch them constantly.


“For me, it’s not finding out where’s the next big house party,” he says. “It’s more [about] how do we communicate and make sure that if there is something going on — number one — that we are in the loop.”
