On Monday afternoon in Exeter, N.H., Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, revealed her $350 billion, 10-year plan aimed at making higher-education more affordable while decreasing student loan debt. This initiative comes after student response to the increasing debt, a number that clocks in at 


In her public announcement, Clinton said increasingly the affordability of higher education is “one of the most important ways we can ease the burden on families.”


Her plan – coined the “
” – calls for a new spending regime by the federal government which will help students pay for public colleges without needing to take out loans for tuition. Campaign aides reportedly told 
 that Clinton aims to reduce the cost of four-year public schools, make two-year community colleges tuition-free and cut student loan interest rates.






Let’s make college affordable, relieve the crushing burden of student debt, and help every family get ahead. Watch:

“Students will be able to attend an in-state public university to get a 4-year degree without ever having to take out a loan,” one Clinton campaign 
 said.


Unlike her competitor for the Democratic nomination, 
, Clinton is not promising to make higher-education completely free. Many students and parents would still bear the burden of housing and food expenses and students would have to commit to working at least 10 hours a week.

“For many students, it would translate into debt-free tuition,” 
 Carmel Martin, executive vice president for policy at the Center for American Progress, who advised Clinton on the plan. “It will depend on the student circumstances and the institution they are going to.”


Clinton’s plan gives around $175 billion in grants to states that guarantee “no-loan” tuition at four year public colleges and free tuition at community colleges. The money ensures college students won’t have to take out loans to finance their education at four-year, public universities.

“States will distribute funds only to colleges and universities that demonstrate that they can meet these guarantees by lowering the cost of college on their campuses, ensuring that all funds received will be applied to instruction and learning, and improving the prospects for completion,” another 
 claims.


After receiving federal aid, states would have to end budget cuts which increase spending on higher-education and make adjustments to halt the cost of tuition which has 
 Her plan makes it so parents are paying less for their child’s education, while the federal government contributes more.

According to 
 Clinton will pay for this by “capping the value of itemized deductions that wealthy families can take on their tax returns.” But Clinton needs support from Congress, state governors and legislators – an overwhelming Republican majority — to push the plan through, which could present problems.


For those currently repaying students loans, Clinton’s plan gives them the ability to refinance their debt at a lower rate. 
 reports that Clinton will also expand “income-based repayment programs” allowing students to cap their payments at 10% of their income with remaining debt forgiven after 20 years.

Lower costs for higher education has gained traction amongst Millennium voters. 
 she believes this plan will help her gain support from the younger crowd. During her speech, she encouraged the Millennial generation to text “college” to 47246 to get more information and claimed that she’s unveiling her new plan on the social media app, Snapchat.
