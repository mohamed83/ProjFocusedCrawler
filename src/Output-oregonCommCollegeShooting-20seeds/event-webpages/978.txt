Packing for college is stressful, annoying and, surprisingly, very difficult.


For some reason, over our high school years we’ve become unnecessarily attached to everything in our room, and we can’t even fathom leaving a single thing behind — even if it is an embarrassingly dirty teddy bear we’ve had since we were five. To the world, it’s trash, to us, he’s Mr. Fluffy.


But the sad truth is this: we can’t pack our entire room and bring it to college with us, despite our best efforts. And we definitely shouldn’t. There are some things that are better left in the past.


So for those of you with a hoarding problem, I give you the anti-college packing list. Here are 10 things to leave behind when you leave for school this year.


1. Any and all stuffed animals


Don’t be that person. Do you really want to be known as the guy/girl with that really creepy stuffed bunny? Or the person that has an entire unicorn family spread out across their bedspread?


RELATED: 


You might think that this is a pointless statement, but you’d be surprised. So for those of you weirdos that can’t seem to let go of your childhood, it’s time. Society is forcing you to grow up.


The only exception: Build-A-Bears. I mean, they’re just adorable and we’ll never outgrow them, no matter how hard we try.


2. Clothes you haven’t worn in the past year


If you’re packing a T-shirt you haven’t pulled out of your closet since freshman year, you don’t need it. As a general rule of thumb, if you haven’t worn the clothing item you’re packing in the last year, it’s not something you need, or even something you want.


It’s something you can’t let go of for whatever reason that may be, and it’s time to get over that. There are TV shows about people like you, and I don’t think that’s the path you want to go down.


Plus, you’ll probably gain the Freshman 15 and not be able to fit into any of your old clothes again anyway. So you have that to look forward to.


3. Your entire shoe collection


Yes, we all love shoes. No, you don’t need every pair you own. They take up too much room, and I promise you won’t even wear half of them.


RELATED: 


So rather than buying 20 shoe racks just to fit them all in your abysmally small closet, bring the pairs of shoes that you are positive you’ll need, and leave the rest behind.


You don’t need them all.


4. Anything valuable


If you don’t want it stolen, don’t bring it. Of course, there are exceptions here — like your laptop — but things such as expensive jewelry, your entire baseball card collection or that Coach purse you love to show off – they can all stay home.


If you’re not sure if the item you’re packing fits this description, then it probably does. So unless having it is essential to your college experience, I suggest you leave it at home.


5. Your DVD/book collection


These both take up way more room than you’d think, and when you have the tiny amount of space that you’re about to, it creates unnecessary clutter.


You can certainly pack a few favorites here and there, but the entirety of your stock isn’t needed, especially with the Kindle and Netflix right at your fingertips.


Plus, you’re going to have so much work to do and fun in between, that you won’t even have time for yourself anyway.


6. Notebooks/binders


These are officially items of the past. While some classes have a “no electronics” rule that absolutely kills you inside, this is such a rare occasion that you’re better off not packing them and then buying one or two if you need them later on (which you most likely won’t).


Your laptop is going to be your best friend, I promise.


7. Anything your roommate already packed


If your roommate has it, you don’t need it. You’ll find out very quickly that roommates have an unspoken, “what’s mine is yours” policy. So rather than bringing along a second TV, Keurig and printer, check with your roommate first.


You’ll be using their stuff in a matter of minutes, so you might as well pack like it.


8. Furniture


If it’s just an office chair or if it’s a couch – leave it at home.


These are huge and take up tons of room that you don’t have, and you’re never going to use them.


You won’t ever sit at the desk in your room (you’ll either sit on the bed or at the library) and most of the time, you won’t even be in your room. Plus, if you’re living in an apartment, it should come furnished, and if you’re living in a dorm, you have no room for furniture, trust me.


9. Air mattresses


These take up more room than they need to, and you aren’t going to have people visiting nearly enough to justify taking up the room.


Rather, you should work out an agreement with your friends in advance so they know to bring an air mattress with them when they visit, or just let them stay in your bed.


When you have limited room, you need to think ahead and leave behind anything that’s only useful on a rare occasion.


10. Off-season clothes/shoes


If you’re moving in during the summer, don’t pack clothes for the winter. You don’t need them — not yet.


So leave behind all boots, winter coats, etc. until the time comes, and you can switch out your warm weather outfits for the cold weather gear. This saves you tons of space and makes moving in and out that much easier.


Packing for college is difficult, especially when you’re guessing what you’re going to need for the next year. Your best bet is to be thrifty, and trust me, less is more is going to be your catch phrase for the next four years.
