Undocumented students work for support, reform

High school students often dread the thought of applying to college, however for many undocumented youth living in America, there is a harsher reality: not attending college at all.


If they are accepted, affording college is another obstacle. Since most undocumented students are unable to receive any state funding, they often must pay the highest tuition rates.


In the U.S., there are approximately 
 and somewhere between 7,000 to 13,000 of those enroll in college.










President Barack Obama enacted a polices for illegal immigrants — 
 in 2012 and 
 in 2014, which granted undocumented citizens the right to a work permit as well as deferment from deportation.


The top five states in the U.S. where 
 are California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois. In each of these, there are students taking action to push for immigration reform.


RELATED: 


Kevin Ruiz, a member of the Undocumented Student Alliance at the University of Georgia (UGA), says one common misconception that people have about his organization is that it is made up of individuals who are undocumented. However, undocumented students cannot attened UGA due to a statewide ban.




Seeking alternative approaches to dignify and empower undocumented individuals in Georgia, Ruiz says his organization tutors undocumented local high school students on gaining acceptance into universities outside of Georgia.


Additionally, Ruiz says he spends the majority of his time coordinating the transportation of undocumented students to and from 
, an Atlanta-based institution for the undocumented youth providing tuition-free education, college application help and scholarship assistance.


At the University of California-Irvine (UCI), Ana Barragan, coordinator for the UCI DREAMers, works closely with undocumented students, helping them with concerns, either academic or financial. Barragan says she helps run the DREAMers Advocate Program, which strives to raise awareness and educate students about the immigration policies and laws that impact the undocumented.

One of the difficulties Barragan faces as a coordinator is reaching out to students who do not feel comfortable disclosing their illegal status, often because of a lack of information.




“I think knowledge empowers people and makes them more comfortable to ‘come out of the closet’ to say they’re undocumented,” Barragan says.


Rene Amel Peralta, UCI senior and co-chair of DREAMers, says he was initially afraid to address his illegal status because of the possibility of being deported.


“There are other people like us. There is no reason for us to be afraid because there are other people who are going through the same struggles and who want the same thing — to succeed in this society and eventually help the society we grew up in,” he says.


Being heavily involved in the undocumented movement, Paralta says he would not have been successful if it was not for the strong social support group the program offered. He says one of the biggest things they have accomplished as an organization was Barragan to help undocumented students.


Vishal Disawar, student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), founded an undocumented student organization called RISE, which aims to advocate equal policy through 
the use of innovative technology.


When Disawar created the organization in 2014, his main objective was to ultimately convince students to register to vote so elected officials could support undocumented immigration.


“What really motivated me to come out with my story was when I started reading articles about student activists rising up and fighting for this cause… it came to my mind that we should have something like this on campus for undocumented students to start rising up and fighting for this cause as well,” Disawar says.


As more undocumented students joined his efforts in RISE, Disawar says he shared all of the undocumented students’ stories — including his own — on various social media platforms. Before mid-term elections took place in 2014, Disawar says he got 100 students to register on his online voting registration database.


Looking toward the future, he is in the process of creating an online platform to combine both politics and technology with the basis for immigration reform, which would enable users to voice out their opinions for ongoing issues, such as the newly proposed amendment to prohibit further funding for DACA.
