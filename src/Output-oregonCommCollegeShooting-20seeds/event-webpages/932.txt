Students take lead in changing college rape culture

At some universities, rape is often referred to by other names – euphemisms from “personal injury” to “non-consensual sex.”


For some administrators, the solutions offered can be leaving school or counseling. For some rapists, the penalties are lighter than the punishment for cheating on a test.


Universities have begun to 
 these issues at the call of the U.S. Department of Education, but many students think institutions are falling short. In the past year, a growing informal national network of activists and students has emerged to lead their own change.


“We’re definitely seeing a huge rise in activism on this issue. I’ve never heard of so many survivors coming forward,” said Dana Bolger, an Amherst College senior. “We’re releasing a domino effect.”


Bolger had her own survival story to tell but, she said, after revealing it to her dean was told to take time off. She did. When she came back, she felt empowered to protect possible victims after hearing her rapist had assaulted another woman.


This past month, Bolger helped lead a large collective of survivor-activists to launch 
. Students from various universities aim to educate college students about their rights under 
, a federal civil right that prohibits sex discrimination in education.


The campaign currently has over 4,000 supporters on Facebook and Bolger said not only students, but administrators, professors and other organizations have reached out.


Last month saw the launch of another student-initiative virtual campaign, 
 which guides students on how to launch a complaint against their school.


“What’s happening is that colleges across the country need to create policies that work for long-term not for short-term,” said Mia Ferguson, 19, a member of the movement. “We help students not only file complaints but address what solutions might help schools.”


Through the efforts of both campaigns and activists across the country, a wave of complaints from students against colleges nationwide have been filed.


Ferguson, an engineering major at Swarthmore College, filed a federal complaint last spring maintaining the college has been lax on reporting sexual-assault cases.


Other 
 under investigation for the wrongful handling of sexual misconduct include University of Southern California, Dartmouth College, Occidental College and University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.


“Institutions are supposed to be there to protect students, and they’re falling short,” Ferguson said. “Students wouldn’t be coming forward if it was just a structural problem. It’s when those administrators are hurtful and mean and betraying them. That’s when people realize there’s something wrong.”


Bolger helped put together a 
 of Amherst rape-survivor photos last year, detailing what members of the community said after sexual assaults on campus — such as, “Why don’t you take a year off, get a job at Starbucks and come back after he’s graduated?”


Creating a voice for survivors and a magazine about sexual violence, the photos were published in It Happens Here, which Bolger and other students began publishing last spring.


Angie Epifano, another Amherst student, shared an 
 of being raped two years ago and her tale would come to further ignite the movement. Ignored by the administration, denied an immediate room change and prohibited from her study abroad, Epifano was involuntary committed to a psychiatric ward for five days.


The ordeal was not unique to Epifano or Bolger or Amherst College.


Up to 25% of females and 4% of males are victims of sexual assault on college campuses in the U.S., according to a recent 
 by the American Association of University Professors.


Many of the institutions facing complaints or under controversy have started overhauling their policies. For example, after this summer’s 
 of a young woman by four football players, the University of Vanderbilt has said it is moving aggressively to protect their students.


Yet, for activists like Bolger and Ferguson, the solution is not in changing one entity: The institutions have to change but so do students not connected to the issue.


“There are these cycles of college activism. I’m hopeful but sort of cautious,” Bolger said. “It was really reaffirming to see people were starting to take notice and care (after Epifano’s story). I and other survivor had been telling students about this for a long time and people put their blinders up. They finally put them down.”
