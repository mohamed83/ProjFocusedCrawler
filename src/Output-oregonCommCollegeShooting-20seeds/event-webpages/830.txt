Student-developed safety app highlights increased entrepreneurship on campuses

Since childhood, Robin Mehta has been deeply fascinated with entrepreneurship. She spent her days drawing on pieces of paper, crafting in any way that she could. She even remembers a time when she begged her parents to let her create a lemonade stand.


“My parents didn’t let me because they were like, ‘you shouldn’t be working,’” Mehta, a rising University of Michigan senior studying computer science, says.


Now Mehta is realizing her creative potential with the work she’s doing with her new app.


The idea for the app, called Bounce, came to Mehta during her freshman year of college.


“Staying out late in a college town was something I never had the freedom to experience before,” Mehta says. “I was really nervous about being alone at night, so I wanted people to walk home with.”

As Mehta recognized the need for a late-night buddy system she began brainstorming a solution to the problem. What followed was Bounce. Users plug their home address into Bounce so that when they’re out at a party or late night event, they can simply activate the app, find others with similar home addresses and walk home in a pair or group.


“Bounce works on the principle that weak ties are safe ties,” says Mehta. “You may not know the Average Joes that live next door, but walking home with them could make you feel a lot safer on a late night out.”


While Bounce has potential to change the way many college students walk home at night, Mehta admits it has kinks to work out. One of which is how to guarantee that these so-called weak ties aren’t predators who would assault someone on a walk home.


A vetting system could serve as a potential solution. Those known personally by Mehta and the rest of the Bounce team would earn a check mark, similar to the blue Twitter check mark, that verifies they are a reliable person for other Bounce users to walk with on their way home. This idea, Mehta says, would ideally expand to include a user rating system, through which users could rate those they previously walked home with. Another solution is to allow a certain ratio of men to women within a group walking home, as Mehta believes women are less likely to use the app for manipulative purposes.


Mehta hopes to release Bounce as a downloadable iOS app soon, with an Android version following shortly after.



Although Mehta created Bounce, she also credits her partner Steven Schmatz, who has helped Mehta with Bounce since from the beginning
.


Mehta has also taken advantage of a variety of resources on Michigan’s campus. She has participated in 
, the University of Michigan’s hackathon, which brings students together to conceptualize and build a project within a weekend. This space helped Mehta turn her inspiration for Bounce into reality.


She’s also relied on the community and resources of Shift, a creator’s space for students where mentors from the 
 have provided her with resources to resolve countless issues. In addition, she’s been able to take advantage of the Center for Entrepreneurship and funding from Michigan’s college of Literature, Science, and the Arts to participate in entrepreneurship competitions. In one of these competitions, optiMize, she won $5,000 in funding as a finalist.


Mehta’s drive and the resources that have helped her achieve her vision come during
.


This trend aligns with opportunities and resources provided to student entrepreneurs at colleges. Penn State alumni, for example, recently founded the 
, which provides six student teams $10,000 worth of seed money to develop entrepreneurship projects during the summer. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, recently created the 
, which provides a variety of resources, such as helping to fund pitch contests that fund winners with seed money for projects.


Along with money, universities also increasingly provide opportunities to build the skills needed for pursuing a life of entrepreneurship. 
, 17 of the top 25 entrepreneurship programs were created within the last 20 years. Some of these programs, such as the entrepreneurship minor at the University of Michigan, incorporate entrepreneurship classes as well as practicum experience. The latter gives students the 
 for implementing and executing an entrepreneurial idea.


““I think it’s good that they’re encouraging the idea of entrepreneurship because it’s not really an idea that’s very present in the academic setting,” says Mehta, who says that too many professors focus on the memorization of information. “Don’t just take a test. Actually put your mind to it and be creative.”


While these programs and resources aid the creation of entrepreneurship programs, Mehta says the core of an entrepreneur is his or her inherent drive.


“It comes kind of naturally to people who are constantly thinking about it,” Mehta says. “Personally, I’m just obsessed with reading about founders of companies. I’m just always thinking about different ideas to make technology better.”
