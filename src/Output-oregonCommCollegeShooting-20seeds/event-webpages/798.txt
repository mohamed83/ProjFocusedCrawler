Annual Christmas traditions allow students to slow down, take a break from exams and enjoy the season with fellow classmates and members of the community. Here are four beloved campus Christmas traditions.

The Wake Forest University community celebrated its 50th annual Lovefeast this year. Inspired by the like-named Moravian service, this beloved campus tradition was started by student Jane Sherrill Stroupe in 1965. Students – along with faculty, staff and others in the area – gather in the university’s Wait Chapel to share Moravian coffee and buns and sing Christmas carols such as 
Joy to the World
 and 
Angels We Have Heard on High
.


Some alumni even cross state lines just to attend the Lovefeast.


“The man sitting next to me said it became a tradition for him and his wife when their sons attended Wake, and now they travel two hours each year to attend,” says senior Ashley Beyer. “I hope to continue the tradition and watch the Lovefeast from home in future years.”


The service features a flute choir and the university concert choir, which performs throughout the evening and leads attendees in song. At the end of the night, attendees light their candles to brighten the dimmed room as everyone sings 
Silent Night
.


Hanging of the Green


Members of the Samford University community come together each December for the Hanging of the Green, a ceremony that calls attendees to reflect on the central meaning of Christmas—the birth of Jesus.


At the service, senior recepients of prestigious scholarships hang greenery down the aisles of Reid Chapel. The celebration then moves outside where University President Andrew Westmoreland reads the story of Jesus’s birth from the Bible.


Morgan Michell, a junior, enjoys the sense of community fostered by the event, especially since it occurs before finals. She also values the fact that Westmoreland emphasizes the spiritual meaning of Christmas


“It reminds me how blessed I am to go to a school where that is a priority,” Michell says.


Yule Log


The Yule Log ceremony gives students at the College of William & Mary a festive way to relax during finals before heading home for break. With logs burning to keep everyone warm, students sit back and listen to carols and stories about Christmas traditions around the world.


Perhaps the most unique aspect of the event is when the college’s president dons a Santa Claus suit and reads 
How the Grinch Stole Christmas.

While Stanford University lacks an official mascot, the Stanford Tree is as close is it gets. Since the tree on the university’s crest is an evergreen, it is often depicted as a traditional Christmas tree — with ornaments and other decorations, to boot.


Students selected to be this unofficial mascot make their own tree costumes. In past years there have been both fir and deciduous trees, and this year even a palm tree.


“The Tree is an amazing vessel and representation for the spirit of Stanford,” says Nicoletta von Heidegger, a 2013 graduate who was the Tree her senior year. “As the tree, you can really act out and demonstrate your uniqueness and creativity.”
