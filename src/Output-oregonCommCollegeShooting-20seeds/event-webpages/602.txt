Organizers hold signs at a vigil in downtown Athens, Ga. (Daniel Funke, USA TODAY College)


The 
 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) Feb. 11 sent shockwaves around the world.


Muslim civil liberties organizations quickly condemned the shootings, international groups 
 against anti-Islam bias and social media exploded with the 
 hashtag.


And since then, students at universities throughout the South have been anything but quiet about it.


Attiya Latif, a freshman at the University of Virginia (UVA), helped the Muslim Students Association (MSA) organize 
 Feb. 15 in honor of the slain students. According to UVA’s 
, more than 1,000 people attended the event.


“For UVA, the vigil was all about solidarity with UNC — showing that we cared, that our community was there for them, that we as individuals were there for them,” she says.


Although 
 to determine whether the killings can be classified as a hate crime, Latif thinks accused killer Craig Stephen Hicks’ 
 as well as southerners’ historical intolerance of Muslims most likely played a role in the murders.


“From the beginning, it’s been a very personal endeavor to get this vigil sponsored because I feel like it needs to be addressed,” Latif says. “This is an issue where, if something like this could happen at one southern university … then it could happen at any southern university.”

For Latif that possibility is very real.


“As a young Muslim American, I am very concerned for my safety at university,” Latif says. “There’s always this possibility of hate speech that leads to something farther, something less innocent than a couple of phrases or a look that you get in passing.”


Sympathetic response


After UNC held 
 honoring the victims of the shooting, other colleges in the South quickly followed suit.


At the University of Georgia (UGA), about 100 students and Athens, Ga., citizens 
 in frigid temperatures Feb. 18 to spread awareness of religious intolerance in the U.S.


Saad Bashir, a member of the Muslim Student Association (MSA) at UGA and one of the vigil’s coordinators, says the 
 and other terrorist groups has led to growing Islamophobia in the country, something he hopes to help dispel.


“One of the major things that we want to stress here is that Muslims are Americans too … we want to show that we’re like everybody else,” he says. “There has been this issue that’s been going around in America for a long time, but the media hasn’t reported on it and it hasn’t come to the forefront of our minds and we haven’t been able to vocalize our issues. With this rallying point, we’re hoping people will become more aware.”


Yusra Aurangzeb, a senior at UGA and a vigil organizer, says the problem is “not [only] a southern problem,” but instead affects people everywhere with lingering ignorance about Muslim culture.


Abdullah Shaheen, president of the Muslim Students’ Association at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), agrees, saying his school is actually generally accepting of his religion, though several of his friends have still expressed concern about their safety at UAB in the wake of the UNC shootings.

“After it happened, I had more than one person come up to me and be like ‘Yeah, I’m a little scared about living here right now.’ They’re legitimately scared for their lives,” he says. “So it kind of hits home — these kids were just normal students.”


Shaheen says the killings inspired him to host 
 Feb. 12 with hopes that it would raise awareness about one thing that set the UNC victims apart — their religion.


“They were normal kids. They were good people and they were wrongly killed,” he says. “I think it happened because there is a lot of ignorance in the world about Islam and other religions in general.”


At the University of South Florida, junior Malak Fakhoury helped organize 
 Feb. 13. She says the #MuslimLivesMatter hashtag coupled with widespread student activism has helped bring Muslim student issues to the forefront of media attention, which she hopes will help change popular misconceptions about Islam.


“I think what helped a lot was the outpour of sympathy from all over the nation of people standing against Islamophobia and saying this is wrong and this is a crime and this doesn’t reflect people’s feelings towards Muslims,” she says. “The solution is just getting to know each other.”

Education with a goal of unity


At UVA, Latif is working to promote a more inclusive campus climate by teaching bystander intervention tactics that can be used in instances of religious intolerance. And at UAB, Shaheen will spend the coming weeks working on Islam Awareness Week, which aims to educate more people about the faith as well as the culture of Muslims.


However, Latif says, until people come to view them just like everyone else, Muslims will always encounter forms of discrimination in the U.S.


“It’s just a general trend of how people react to you kind of wearing your religion on your head,” she says. “It’s sad because you’re characterized by everything that the media says you represent, when in reality you’re just a person following a faith — just like everyone else around you.”
