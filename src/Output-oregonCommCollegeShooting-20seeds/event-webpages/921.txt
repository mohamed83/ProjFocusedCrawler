While many think that parents shouldn’t cover college expenses for their kids, some still think it’s the right thing to do.


Parents are paying for their kids’ college less often.


According to a 2013 Sallie Mae study, parents fund 27% of their kids’ college expenses, down from 36% in 2010. A 2013 survey from Citi and Seventeen Magazine of 1,000 students showed that 22% of parents pay for their kids’ college, with four out of five 
 while in school. It appears that parents are less willing or less able to cover the cost of college for their kids than in previous decades.


While many think that parents shouldn’t cover college expenses for their kids no matter what, some still think it’s the right thing to do.


The case for students paying their own way


Even parents who could well afford to pay the full amount of their kids’ college tuition think students should be responsible for their own college costs.


According to a 2012 survey by Legg Mason, 72% of affluent families (those with parents that have $250,000 or more in investable assets) thought that their kids should contribute to at least a portion of the total college cost, with one-third thinking that students should contribute up to half, 7% saying their kids should contribute most of it and 2% saying they should pay for all of it.


A 2013 study by Laura Hamilton, a professor at the University of California-Merced, showed that while college attendance would likely increase if parents funded it, a student’s GPA is often lower when that happens.


According to John Robinson, a store manager in Las Vegas who didn’t pay any of his daughters’ college tuition, it’s simply not the responsibility of a parent to pay the college expenses of their children.


“Anything you personally work for holds greater value than something that is handed to you,” Robinson said. “It teaches lessons in responsibility and finance and I think it is also a great motivator, to find a good job in their field, to pay off the loans they opened.”


Robinson helped his daughters with other expenses during their college years, such as car repairs and health insurance. But since he instilled values of independence in them growing up, they didn’t even ask for him to pay for college.


Some see paying their children’s college as a threat to saving for retirement. One point in a Forbes article titled “
” compares helping your kids with college to helping them with an oxygen mask on an airplane: “You should put on your own oxygen mask first, before assisting children.”


Though this view is growing, a number of people still advocate for the opposite.


Why parents should consider covering the costs



Not all studies are against those advocating for parents covering their kids’ college.


While the study from Laura Hamilton, a professor at U.C.-Merced, showed that GPAs are generally lower among students whose parents cover their school expenses, it also showed that these students have higher graduation rates.


Kristin Aguirre, a library assistant in Las Vegas, paid for both her daughter and son’s college expenses, since they were working during college and had other expenses like car payments to worry about. While Aguirre doesn’t think it’s necessarily always the responsibility of the parent to pay for their children’s college, she was happy to do it.


“I think it’s the parents responsibility to give their children every opportunity for a better life, no matter what that looks like — education or not,” Aguirre said.


While love or “investing in your child” may often motivate a parent to cover all of their kid’s college expenses, many advocate for a more balanced approach: both pay.


In a 
 by Lisa Kaplan Gordon, Gordon writes, “No one is saying parents shouldn’t help kids pay for college, if they can afford to. But college should be viewed as a shared responsibility, which can take many forms.” One possible scenario listed in the article consists of four parts:


1. Parents pay for tuition, and room and board; student pays for all extras.

2. Parents pay for expenses for in-state colleges; a student who wants to attend college out-of-state pays the difference in tuition.

3. Student pays for two years at a community college; parents pay for finishing at a four-year college.

4. Parents match (or double or triple) whatever a child saves for college.


Whether parents decide to cover a student’s entire tuition, some of it or none of it is between parents and their kids. At the very least, kids should have an understanding of what college costs and what help is out there (beyond what their parents do or don’t contribute) in the forms of scholarships, 
, grants, work study, etc.
