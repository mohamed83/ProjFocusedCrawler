Scrolling through Facebook, GoFundMe pages can often fill your news feed — students asking for assistance in raising money to take a trip abroad or complete an internship. These crowdfunding sites, like GoFundMe, Kickstarter, Indiegogo and others, utilize the Internet to receive masses of small donations that add up to large-scaled goals.


Two 
 (Millersville, Pa.) students turned to crowdfunding to collectively raise more than $44,000 for two separate causes.


Kiara Allen and Aisling Burns used GoFundMe to raise funds for the families of of track coach Scott Weiser’s 13-year-old son David, who was killed by a car walking home from school and freshman Karlie Hall, 
.


“When it comes to crowdfunding, if you have a good story and the power of social media, those two combined is very powerful,” says Allen.


 raised $24,969 thanks to donations from 587 people. Allen described the experience as one of the most rewarding she has even been a part of.

She wanted to start the page to give back to her coach and his family for all that they have done for the Millersville team and community. The initial goal of $10,000 was reached in less than 12 hours and the final total was more than double the goal.


Social media was the sole driver of the fundraising effort and Allen honed her public relations skills she gained in class to use social media in her favor — something her professors acknowledged.


She says the Millennial generation’s constant connectivity to technology helps these types of campaigns grow.


“I transferred what I had learned in class and applied it in real life,” she says. “It was cool to see how many people I was able to capture in that short amount of time.”


was spearheaded by Burns, raising $19,341 from donations by 558 people. The money will go to charities and to Hall’s family.


Although she 
, Burns says knew women who were in abusive relationships and understood the sudden loss the deceased students’ family felt.


“Millersville is a small school, so we’re a tight knit community here,” she says. “ I wanted to do something to help and to involve the community and Millersville to help as well.”


In less than 24 hours, the GoFundMe page’s goal of $10,000 was surpassed. She, too, promoted the page through personal social media accounts and once her friends began to share it, a chain reaction began.


“When something as tragic as this happens, people want to help and this is a prime example of how social media can be used in a really positive way,” Burns says.


She describes the large response as “overwhelming” and had donations ranging from Millersville students and alumni to anonymous lump sums.


Allen made an effort to respond to the nearly 1,200 emails she received about the campaign — and sent a personal thank you note to each donor.


Both students attribute the great success to the community at Millersville University and are thankful for efforts everyone made.


“This school is so much more than a college for many of us,” Burns says. “When something happens here, good or bad, we are a strong community of support.”
