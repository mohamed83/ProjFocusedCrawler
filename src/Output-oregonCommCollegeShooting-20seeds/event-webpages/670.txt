I used to carry my college decision letters in my backpack.


Well, not all of them. I carried the rejections from Princeton, Stanford and Northwestern, the wait list notifications from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Kenyon and Vanderbilt, and — to round things out —  a truly inexplicable deferred acceptance from Chapman University.


It was largely a matter of coincidence. There was a padded pocket in my trusty backpack (which I had owned since my junior year high school) that, in theory, was intended to hold a laptop. But it didn’t offer enough protection for my heavy 15-inch aluminum beast. It was, however, the perfect size for a file folder full of official letterheads.


So I stuck my letters in said folder, put them in the pocket and mostly forgot about them for two years. 


I was lucky enough to later get an acceptance offer from Vanderbilt, where I ultimately matriculated. And after three years, I’m very happy to have attended and will be proud to have Vanderbilt’s name above mine on a diploma in less than a year’s time.


RELATED: 


Two years of college later, my backpack fell apart at the seams. I replaced it with one that lacked that same handy pocket and, as a result, stopped carrying around my college decision letters. And, to be perfectly honest, I don’t really know what happened to them.


But I never forgot what they meant to me. Those letters — be they rejections, acceptances or wait list notifications — are not indicative of a person’s capacity for success, including mine.


Getting rejected from Princeton or Stanford doesn’t mean your life is over, it turns out. Which is great news considering 93% and 95%, respectively, of the thousands of high school students who applied to the two universities last year were rejected. 


Sure, it was disappointing to have Princeton and Stanford tell me “no.” But those rejections do not mean that I and my fellow “rejects” won’t thrive in college or in life.


For example, a 
 from the Chronicle of Higher Education investigated, among other things, the factors employers looked for in new hires. Out of the eight factors they examined, the reputation of a prospective new hire’s alma mater 
. Internships were first, followed closely by work experience while in school, neither of which is directly tied to which college you attend.


What’s more, graduating from a prestigious college doesn’t necessarily guarantee a higher paying job. A more 
 of this year by the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program 
ranked two- and four-year colleges based on economic outcomes for graduates. No Ivy Leagues — save for the so-called “Ivy of the West Coast,” Stanford —  made it into the top ten four-year schools. 


This isn’t to say that where you go to college doesn’t matter, especially when it comes to factors like 
 
or 
. But it may matter less than what we’ve been told. 


RELATED: 


A number of components — aside from prestige —  are factored into whether a university is the right fit for a certain student. These include — but are not limited to —  location, size, and financial aid and scholarship opportunities. In fact, 
to attend the school that’s more prestigious on paper only to later find out it isn’t the right fit for them.  


Admittance to Harvard doesn’t guarantee you a C-suite position at a major company. Likewise, just because you’re headed to your so-called safety school does not mean you will be stuck working an entry-level job for all of eternity.


College is just one step along one of the many paths to success — paths that diverge and converge at a variety of points.  In my Princeton rejection letter was an important nugget of truth  — that “the committee’s decision is not a judgment about your worth.”


The pressure of college admissions process can make it seem like a decision letter can make or break a student’s future. But the individual decisions that each and every student makes will end up having a far greater impact on their lives than any executive verdict from an admissions committee.


So to all you incoming freshmen: Keep those rejection letters. Stick them in a folder or carry them in your backpack. And in 10 or 15 years (or maybe just two) take them back out and hang them next to your diploma or other awards. Hang them next to the pictures of your family and friends. Because a college decision letter can neither guarantee nor deny you success and happiness.
