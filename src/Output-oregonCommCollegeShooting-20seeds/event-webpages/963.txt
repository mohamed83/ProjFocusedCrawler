The Princeton Review
 recently published its annual ‘Best 380 Colleges’ 2016 edition. One school has won its title as the most sober school for the 
: Brigham Young University (BYU) in Utah.


RELATED: 


Given current and past consumer culture, it would seem as though a list like this would not exist. Jesus brought out wine during the Last Supper, The Weeknd 
  and everyone at Miley Cyrus’s party is trying to get “
.”


The influence of being under the influence is very much alive, particularly on college campuses.


A
 study conducted by Villanova University found 80% of college students drink alcohol and between
 of college students drink alcohol at a level that is regarded as problematic. A 2012 survey conducted by the 
 found that 16-24 year-olds consumed the most alcohol among age groups. And a 
 conducted by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that the rate of current use of illicit drugs among young adults aged 18 to 25 was 21.5%. The results reflected consistently with the steady rate of current marijuana use in this age group during the time.

But despite the our culture’s narrative of getting wasted, the list provides evidence to the counter culture. Some, but not all, college students’ weekend plans involve drinking.  So, how can students on sober campuses like BYU spend their free time?


Here are a few alternatives:


1. GO ON AN ADVENTURE.



If you are going to school far away from your hometown, take the time to explore and learn the area. Granted, some schools are in the middle of cow farms or perhaps even some desert but most likely, you’ll only be in town for four years. When you’re 30, and have traveled to all the big cities and met the most famous people, you’ll look back and wonder what it would have been like to meet the unsung characters of America and explore the lands without landmarks. You don’t have to go wandering the streets alone at night and abandon all technology to explore, but you’ll certainly need an open mind.


2.PICK UP A PART-TIME JOB.



Get a job on weeknights. Most people do not want to serve fries to drunk frat boys as there are much better ways to use your time. That being said, having a service job on weeknights can be a way to maximize tips if you are working at a restaurant since everyone is usually out for the night scene. Or, if you’re working at a campus library (which is usually deserted on Friday and Saturday nights), it’s an easy way to catch up on work during slow periods and get easy money. Either way, working during school allows you to cultivate patience and work ethic, attributes which are never bad to have. In fact, I have learned more in my jobs on campus than in some classes.

3. Get involved on-campus.



Everyone will tell you to join an extracurricular activity to make friends and gain a skill or understanding. While it is very trite advice, it’s actually true. Pick one activity that you really enjoy and stick to it for the next four years, if possible. If you commit to something, it will consume more of your time and give you an out from activities you do not want to give your attention to.


4.Understand it’s OK to stay in.



If you want to just stay in and do nothing on weekends, that’s fine too. Buy a deck of cards or a Monopoly board game (if you really want to kill three hours and possibly some friendships), purchase a subscription at a tutorial site and learn how to use Photoshop or sew. If all else fails, order a pizza and binge-watch the fifth season of 
Friends
. Alone time is good for the mind. Don’t ever feel forced to party out of fear of being the black sheep.
