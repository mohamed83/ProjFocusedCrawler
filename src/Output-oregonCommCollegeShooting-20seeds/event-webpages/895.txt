Delaware State University officials say a second man has been charged in the shooting of a student at an off-campus residence hall.


University spokesman Carlos Holmes said in an email that Dover Police arrested 25-year-old Michael Clark of Dover on Wednesday. He is charged with assault, conspiracy and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony.


On Tuesday, police charged 25-year-old Marshawn Fortner of Dover with the same offenses.


Holmes says neither suspect is a DSU student.


A male student was shot Monday in the parking lot of Living and Learning Commons, about one-mile north of the main campus. The student remains hospitalized for injuries that do not appear to be life-threatening, Holmes says.


The shooting prompted a school lockdown for several hours.
