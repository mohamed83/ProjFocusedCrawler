Those who do not identify as male or female do not use the gendered pronouns he or she, but instead utilize entirely new pronouns that are gender-neutral


Correction: An earlier version of this article included incorrect pronouns, which were inserted during the editing process, to reference Genny Beemyn. The corrections have been made in the article below.


For most people, something as simple as knowing which pronouns to use in conversation is no challenge. But for those who identify as neither male nor female, even a simple interaction can turn into a lesson on modern gender.


Those who do not identify as male or female do not use the gendered pronouns he or she, but instead utilize 
 that are gender-neutral. And with neutral identification comes the need for a larger vocabulary and a willingness to instruct others on its use.


A person who 
 is someone who lies outside of the two rigid gender constructions of male or female. On college campuses, increasing visibility of gender neutrality is tied to greater education and resources from school departments.


According to Genny Beemyn, director of the Stonewall Center — the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s LGBT resource center — the idea of existing outside of the gender binary and identifying as genderqueer is largely a college campus phenomenon.


Beemyn says it has become practice in the genderqueer community to ask an individual’s preferred pronouns upon meeting. Beemyn did acknowledge that one particular pronoun set, the singular they/them/their, has become increasingly popular with those in the community due to its familiarity.


“We already have that language, people know those pronouns. They just don’t use them in a singular case and I think it will be a lot easier for people to start applying them,” Beemyn said, comparing the singular they/them/their to other gender-neutral pronouns.


Some university LGBT groups have begun to educate students about interacting with genderqueer people and understanding their way of life.


At UMass, the Stonewall Center hosts a number of “ally trainings” where representatives go to student groups, campus departments or other UMass syndicates to educate members about various LGBT topics, including gender identity and gender-neutral pronouns.


At schools such as the nearby Hampshire College, this student education begins upon arrival on campus, according to student Sofia Picatoste.


“I was really exposed to how aware my school is of gender pronouns the moment I arrived at Hampshire,” said Picatoste. “When first-years first came and we would introduce ourselves we would have to say our pronouns, whether or not they were different or outside the binary.”


Even outside the Northeast, schools are pressing for increased student education on these issues.


At the University of Nevada – Reno, graduate assistant Shirley Diaz of the Center for Student Cultural Diversity says a number of educational resources cover gender identity. According to Diaz, while the school does not specifically have any programs for education on genderqueer individuals, certain university classes, trainings and annual conferences touch upon the issue of gender identity and thinking outside of the gender binary.


For some genderqueer people however, the most important step universities can take to increase awareness of gender neutrality is to change policy to recognize and acknowledge the existence of such lifestyles. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) student and genderqueer person Jay Harmon sees a change in how the school keeps records as a way of promoting visibility of the genderqueer community.


“All of our systems are still male or female,” said Harmon citing school forms that inquire about students’ genders. “First things first, (RPI) needs to allow different gender options on housing and forms.”


According to 
 from the National Student GenderBlind Campaign, 54 colleges and universities in the United States offer gender-neutral housing, an example of such a change in school policy.


While not all college students may be aware of genderqueer individuals on their campus, some universities have certainly taken steps to change this. To people such as Genny Beemyn, it is not just about schools offering gender-neutral housing, but it is also about acknowledging the unique individuals who identify themselves as gender-neutral.
