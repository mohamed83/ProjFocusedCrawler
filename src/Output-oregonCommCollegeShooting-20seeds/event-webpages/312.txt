For college students, Labor Day sales come in the nick of time. The semester’s just begun, and all those office-supply purchases haven’t left much room in your budget to fill out your fall wardrobe. Over in your dorm room, things are looking a little bare. Oh, and that bill from the bookstore definitely has you bargain hunting.


Here are our picks for the seven best Labor Day sales of 2015 — college edition.


Wal-Mart


The discount retailer, already known for low prices, is offering Labor Day weekend markdowns in many departments, from apparel to electronics. It’s a great time for students to cash in on school-related products.


College students will love: 
an impressive price cut on a top tablet. Wal-Mart is discounting the Apple iPad Mini 16GB with Wi-Fi by $50, knocking the price down to $199 (regularly $249).


Overstock


Over at online retailer Overstock, Labor Day translates to discounts of up to 70% on certain items.


The sale encompasses living room and bedroom furniture, area rugs, bedding, bath supplies, patio furniture and other good stuff for those looking to throw one last summer bash or deck out a dorm room.


College students will love:
 the shapely 28-Inch Light Blue Table Lamp for illuminating a favorite study spot. It’s on sale for $41.39 (comparable at $107.99 — that’s a 62% discount).


Old Navy


Labor Day traditionally marks the unofficial beginning of fall, so it’s a good time to outfit yourself for the change of seasons — or, on the flip side, pick up marked-down summer styles for next year. Old Navy has launched a “Labor of Love” sale with the entire store up to 60% off.


If you’re doing your bargain hunting online, shipping is free on orders over $50, and returns are free too.


College students will love: 
bundling up in the Women’s Long Quilted Chambray Jacket for $25, discounted from $49.94 . Guys can pick up the Men’s Slim-Fit Jeans for just $14.99 (regularly $39.94).


Zumiez


If Old Navy isn’t quite your style, there are plenty of Labor Day deals to be had on this shop’s skate-, snow- and surf-centric goods.


It’ll pay to buy in bulk here to take maximum advantage of the retailer’s “buy one, get one 50% off” deals. Plus, select backpack styles start at $29.95. Online orders over $29.95 qualify for free shipping.


College students will love: 
BOGO 50% off hoodies, sneaks, tees and belts.


Bass Pro Shops


When it’s time to get your nose out of the books and step outside for fresh air, outdoor gear’s what you want. Bass Pro Shops’ Labor Day Blowout Sale runs through Sept. 13 with price cuts on apparel, shoes and accessories suited for outdoor adventures.


College students will love: 
Rocky Lynx Gore-Tex Insulated Hunting Boots for men for $79.97, marked down from $129.99 ; or the RedHead Overland Mid Waterproof Hiking Boots for women, discounted from $79.99 to $49.97.


Sleepy’s


Whether you snooze in a dorm room or still crash at home, a comfortable mattress is key for a good night’s sleep before a big exam. The Labor Day Sale at Sleepy’s offers discounts of up to half off most mattresses in the store — in some instances, translating to discounts of more than $1,000.


A bonus: Online orders get free delivery with Tempur-Pedic, Serta iseries, Serta icomfort and Sealy Posturepedic Hybrid mattress purchases.


College students will love:
 the Sertapedic Brookstone Gel Mattress . Through Sept. 7, the twin size is on sale for $499.99, reduced from $799.99 — that’s $300 off. And if you select the “standard boxspring” foundation option, the box spring’s free with the purchase.


Ford


Finally, if you’ve got a bigger purchase in mind, Labor Day offers an opportunity to save on a new ride. Moving out and arriving at college is a big step toward independence, as is owning your own set of wheels.


At Ford, a Free Ride Sales Event running through Sept. 8 offers qualified buyers 0% APR for 72 months on all 2015 Ford vehicles, plus $1,000 in “Labor Day bonus cash” if you go with Ford financing on certain cars and SUVs. There are some exclusions, so you’ll want to visit or call a Ford dealer for details .


College students will love:
 variety — Ford’s not the only one in this game. We found deals at other carmakers as well, including Volkswagen, which offers a $1,000 reward card with the purchase of select 2015 Jetta, Passat or Tiguan models through Sept. 7; and at Chevy, which is giving qualified buyers 0% APR for 72 months.
