From the beautiful island of Jamaica to community college in the New York, Tricia Wildman has been a scholar her entire life.


“I was never the jock. I was never the cheerleader. I was always an academic,” Wildman says.


For Wildman, seeking higher education at Suffolk County Community College in New York was a way to escape the trials of her own life, and a way to come to the United States to follow her dreams.


Wildman was raised by a single-parent mother alongside five other siblings, of which she was the youngest — and the only to attended college.


Because of her mother’s long working hours to support the family, she was frequently out of the house, leaving Wildman to be watched by her then 15-year-old brother, whom she says he both physically and verbally abused her for nearly 15 years.


“I came to New York to continue my education and to financially support my aging mother back home. At a very young age it became obvious to me that education was my only vehicle out of my less than tolerable life,” said Wildman.

So Wildman set her sights on the United States — seeking a degree in psychology, a doctorate in judicial science and the hopes of one day becoming a criminal defense attorney.


But in her journey to seek what she’s always been best at, there were obvious struggles.


“The transition from Jamaica to the United States was not an easy one,” said Wildman. “I had completed my high school education in Jamaica so getting into college in the United States proved to be difficult.”


After applying continuously to multiple four-year institutions in New York with nothing but rejections, Wildman decided to try Suffolk County Community College — hoping she wouldn’t be rejected again because of her status as an international student.


“I was confused, discouraged and on the verge of giving up,” said Wildman. “Suffolk was my last hope for achieving my dreams.”


Because of the stigma of a community college education, Wildman had further trials.


“At first I was hesitant because I was ridiculed by people close to me. I was told anyone can get into a community college and there is nothing special about me,” said Wildman. “Being the strong-minded individual that I am I decided I was going to be the best student Suffolk has ever had.”


And so she was accepted to Suffolk County Community College, and started her educational journey in the United States.


Today, Wildman owes much of her success to Suffolk for giving her the chance that she needed to bridge her educational gap.


“They gave me a chance, and right now those same colleges that rejected me are like knocking my door down, so I’m really really happy,” said Wildman.


Additionally, a huge part of her college journey has been the love and support of those around her. Wildman’s mother has been strong and courageous for her from the start. Wildman’s professors have shown her that education is worth sticking with, no matter how difficult the work.


In her second semester at Suffolk, Wildman lost her job. She wasn’t happy and had no motivation to continue on her path of higher education that she had fought so hard for.


Wildman recalled her Communications 101 professor being the best part of Suffolk, and her favorite memory in academia.


“This woman went above and beyond. She did everything that she could to keep me in school,” said Wildman.


With continued support from her professors, her family and her friends, Wildman knows that she will be in the right place to carry on in her career and push others in the same way.


“I like helping people and I like sharing my story with people,” said Wildman. “For me, if I can just influence one person, that is great.”
