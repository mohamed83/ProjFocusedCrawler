LGBTQ student community continues fight for fair treatment

While colleges have taken steps toward becoming more LGBTQ-friendly, there is still a long way to go.


As 2014 approaches, LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning) “friendliness” 
 at colleges across the country. 


But some students still feel as if schools are not doing enough to ensure acceptance. 


, a former Rutgers University employee accused Jacquelyn Litt, the dean of the women’s college, of disliking lesbians.


Junior and Diversity Peer Educator at the University of Missouri Mary Bifulco — who identifies herself as queer — said she thinks the discrimination of LGBTQ students by administrators and university staff is not an uncommon occurrence, even by those in women and gender studies programs.


“I am reminded that prejudice and discrimination can be found anywhere, but they are even more insidious in places least expected,” Bifulco said. 


Bifulco said she thinks that colleges have come a long way in open mindedness toward the queer community, but they also still have a long way to go.


“So many medical professionals are uninformed about queer identities,” Bifulco said. “I can’t tell you how many times I have been asked [by a student health doctor] if I’m sexually active and when I reply yes, they ask if I am on birth control.”


University of Vermont senior Sam Mersten said she thinks universities need to work on creating an environment for students to feel like they are accepted no matter their sexual preferences or gender identity.


“I think having a class as a requirement for professors and students on gender and sexuality would positively affect the LGBTQ community,” Mersten said. “I know someone who left [the university] because she didn’t feel safe in her classes being a queer woman of color. I think feeling accepted by your professors and peers is a huge thing.”


Some campuses are working toward increasing LGBTQ awareness and understanding.


There are more than 100 LGBT centers at colleges across the country, according to  
. 


Siena Reynolds Dryden, a senior at Hampshire College, feels her school is taking steps toward becoming LGBTQ-friendly. 


“I would say without a doubt that our campus is gay and lesbian accepting, within both the social and academic sphere,” Dryden said. “Yet, bisexual, transgender and queer accepting, that’s a different landscape that requires a completely different type of advocacy, which is constantly in transformation.”


Whether or not schools choose to create a queer-friendly environment, Bifulco said she believes that LGBTQ discrimination is a huge hindrance for campuses.


“If a school does not protect and affirm its LGBTQ members, they are going to experience a lot of lost potential,” she said. “LGBTQ students, staff and faculty have so much to offer campuses but they are not as likely to stay somewhere that isn’t safe for them.”
