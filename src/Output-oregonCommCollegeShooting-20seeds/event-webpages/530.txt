DePayne Middleton Doctor, an employee and alumna of Southern Wesleyan University (SWU), was killed in the Charleston shooting last week. Her alma mater recently announced they will offer full tuition scholarships to her four children — Gracyn, Kaylin, Hali and Czana — if they choose to attend the school.


“Always a warm and enthusiastic leader, DePayne truly believed in the mission of SWU to help students achieve their potential by connecting faith with learning,” Todd Voss, SWU president 
 “Our prayers go out to family and friends. This is a great loss for our students and the Charleston region.”

Doctor worked in SWU’s learning center as an admissions coordinator. She got her master’s degree in management from the university in 1994.


“Right now, more than anything, we want DePayne’s children to know we love them,” 
 Voss. “We want to honor DePayne’s service to SWU and her belief in Christian higher education as an important element in Gracyn, Kaylin, Hali and Czana’s future success.”


Chad Peters, Southern Wesleyan’s vice president for enrollment management, 
 the scholarships allow the university to honor Doctor’s children and the fact that she lived a life focused on serving others.


“We realize the scholarships won’t ease the pain of loss that the children are dealing with now and in the future; however, it is our desire as a community for each of them to know we care about them,” Peters 
 “DePayne often spoke about her children and their accomplishments with co-workers.”
