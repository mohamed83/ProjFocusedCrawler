U. of Vermont remains only campus to give students identity choice

A 
New York Times
 
 published this week takes a look, if belatedly, at a 
 
policy that gives students the power to choose their preferred first names and pronouns, including the neutral “they/them.”


The change was made five years ago, yet UVM is still the only campus to officially give students this option.

I spoke with Elliot Kennedy, 28, who graduated from the university in 2009 and who was part of the task force that helped pave the way for the policy. Kennedy, who identifies as genderqueer (meaning they identify themselves outside the male-female binary) recalls how a 
professor used salutation and last name to respectfully address his students, but says that being addressed as either “Mr.” or “Ms” didn’t feel right.


“He would call me Ms. Kennedy,” Kennedy recalls, “and at the time, identifying as genderqueer, really no salutation would’ve been appropriate.”


Luckily, UVM was, at the time, creating a task force of faculty and students to look into the addition of gender-neutral options, including “they/them.”


Students can use their preferred names and pronouns on the campus “Banner,” a student portal, enabling them to change things such as campus ID cards, class rosters, campus e-mail and unofficial transcripts. It now has some 3,200 students that identify a preferred name or pronoun.


“If you didn’t change it everywhere on campus, you’re making a transgender student’s name less safe not more safe,” says University Registrar Keith Williams, who was involved in the task force, and it creates the opportunity for some students to be outed.


Safety is a big concern.


A 2011 
 by the 
 found that 35% of transgender students attending college, graduate school, professional school or technical school experienced harassment and bullying.


But this is not just a tool for the LGBTQ community: International students use it to give themselves English names, Williams says.


Kennedy, who works with LGBT affairs at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in the U.S. Dept. of Labor, is still astounded at the effectiveness and commitment of all the people involved.  “I think a lot about why it was so effective, and I don’t know,” they admits.


Kory Masen, a transgender student at California State University at Chico who helped create gender-inclusive bathrooms at the school, is excited and kind of jealous about what’s going on at UVM.


“It’s very difficult when there isn’t anybody in power that’s trying to help you,” says Masen, who has been trying to build support for such a policy change at Chico State.


Students there can, however, change their names on the roster and use them on an internal data system called Blackboard, but can’t change their e-mails or IDs.


Masen legally changed his name last year, but still runs into problems. In one instance, Masen says he had to drop a class when the professor refused to acknowledge his preferred (and legal) name.


To help facilitate change on your campus, says Dorothea “Dot” Brauer, the director of UVM’s 
, and a person cited in the 
NYT
 article as instrumental to the task force’s creation, suggests starting with education. The more people who understand the issues, the more they help, she says.


Next, address smaller issues like making gender-inclusive restrooms accessible. If a campus can bring positive attention to student concerns, students are going to feel safer stepping forward and explaining why this is important, she notes.


But it ultimately becomes a matter of finding friends and allies, “people who are going to be friendly and supportive of these changes because it’s going to be a lot of work,” Brauer says.


But the school is ready to help in a concrete way: It will provide for free the code that Banner uses to create gender-neutral options. (Contact Brauer or Williams.)


Williams continues to receive at least one call a week from others looking for advice.


“It’s great to have something that touches people so directly and individually and personally,” he says. “I don’t think most people in higher education get to do that, let alone most people.”
