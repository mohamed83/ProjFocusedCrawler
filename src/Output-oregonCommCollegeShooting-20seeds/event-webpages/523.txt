Manny Alvarez is a 23-year-old college student struggling to stay alive. Fighting one of the rarest forms of cancer, his insurance won’t cover an expensive experimental treatment. Now he’s taking his life into his own hands and raising money via a 


His decision comes during a time when people are increasingly taking advantage of donation websites. Crowdsource funding websites 
 raised $138 million in 2011, $1.17 billion in 2013 and are projected to raise $4.35 billion in 2015.


Alvarez has Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma, a rare cancer with reportedly fewer than 100 diagnoses each year in the United States 
, an oncologist at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Upon diagnosis, Alvarez’s cancer was already 
 and spreading to his lungs.




Alvarez was first directed to the National Institute of Health to participate in a clinical trial. However, the treatment stopped working and his condition continued to worsen. After doctors removed a tumor that threatened to break bones in his knee, Alvarez needed surgery for a partial femur and knee replacement. When doctors performed experiments on the tumor, they 
 that eliminated the cancer cells.


“We don’t know for sure that just because it works in a test tube it’s gonna work in a person,” Wilky, who is Alvarez’s doctor, 
. “All we’re asking is just a little bit of time to try it.”

While Alvarez reportedly began his first round of treatment last week, it 
 by his insurance company Florida Blue, a Blue Cross Blue Shield franchise.

“Because these drugs are not approved for Sarcoma, [Florida Blue was] unable to provide coverage,” 
.


Florida Blue released a statement June 8 
 for approving experimental drugs:


“At times, our members and/or their physicians inquire about the use of experimental drugs or drugs that have not been adequately tested and approved for a particular use.  Florida Blue’s team of physicians conducts a thorough review of the proposed treatment. Based on their medical expertise and scientific evidence on the effectiveness of the treatment, they either approve or deny the request.


Members have the right to appeal if they feel their proposed treatment is inappropriately denied. This process includes an internal review of the case by Florida Blue medical professionals, as well as an independent external review by physicians who are experts in the particular medical field.  If a case goes to external review, Florida Blue will re-evaluate the appeal once that expert review is received.”


Since Alvarez lacks coverage, his network of friends and family began brainstorming unconventional solutions to his problem. According to Cristina Oyarzun, Alvarez’s cousin, the idea to crowd fund the money came from Jose Cordero, one of Alvarez’s friends.

“You hear about things like this going viral, and we said ‘well, let’s give it a shot,’” says Oyarzun. “It was a shot in the dark. We didn’t really know what was going to happen. We were hoping that it’d be for the best, and it was.”


Alvarez’s family researched various crowd funding sources and Oyarzun says they eventually chose CrowdRise after being told it pockets a lower percentage of raised funds.
 
They then shared the link to Alvarez’s CrowdRise page on their personal Facebook pages as well as with local media.


“From there, it just went viral,” says Oyarzun.


The family has since 
, which covers 47% of Alvarez’s projected medical costs. This will be enough for one round of treatment. Oyarzun says Alvarez has been overwhelmed by the support has has received.


“I think we’ll find a way,” Alvarez told CBS. “I think there’s always a way. I just gotta find it.”
