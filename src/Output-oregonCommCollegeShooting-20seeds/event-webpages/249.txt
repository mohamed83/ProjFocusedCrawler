Guns: Coming soon to a backpack near you?


Right now, law-makers in Nevada are considering “campus carry” bills. These bills would allow any licensed 21-year-old or older to bring a concealed weapon onto campus.


If licensed individuals want to bring their weapons to school, currently they must send an application to law enforcement and then get approval from the campus president, says Catherine Cortez Masto, executive vice chancellor for the Nevada System of Higher Education.


If AB 148 passes, not only will presidential approval be unnecessary — but campus security won’t know who’s packing the heat.


Masto believes the proposal is unnecessary.


“The law works right now and from our perspective, it does not need to be changed,” she says. “The need for them to have this broad authority to carry a concealed weapons doesn’t exist. This is a solution in search for a problem that doesn’t exist.”


According to Masto, the presidents of all the college institutions, the chancellor, the board of regents and multiple student organizations in Nevada are all opposed to the bill as well.


Andy Pelosi, founder of 
, says his organization “adamantly opposes” all laws that would allow guns on campus.


“College campuses are, for the most part, safe environments,” he says. “Adding concealed weapons only increases the risk to college campus communities.”


Some proponents of the bill argue having guns on campus will protect students in the case of mass shootings, like the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre. In response, Pelosi says these incidents are “horrific, but rare.”


“Also, people with concealed weapon permits don’t have the training that law enforcement [officials] receive,” he says. “So they probably wouldn’t be able to stop a Virginia Tech-style shooting.”


To get a concealed carry weapons (CCW) permit, 
 by taking a state-approved course. Most of these training courses are around 
.


Stephen Hargarten, director of the Medical College of Wisconsin’s Injury Research Center, is concerned whether this level of training will be adequate.


“What would the requirements for the on-going, demonstrated ability to have this product with lethal amounts of kinetic energy?” he says. “I’m not a training expert, but law enforcement and security agencies get more than eight hours.”


He points out many young adults have a limited ability to decide which scenarios deserve a “potentially lethal response.”


Some claim campus carry laws will discourage violent crime. Pelosi is unconvinced; in fact,his organization found on-campus crime rates actually increased in Utah and Colorado after those states 


However, some pro-gun advocates have focused on one crime in particular: sexual assault.


, “If these young, hot little girls on campus have a firearm, I wonder how many men will want to assault them. The sexual assaults that are occurring will go down once these predators have a bullet in their head.”


Masto believes arming women isn’t the answer to reducing sexual assault rates.


“The answer is instead to work on prevention, intervention and education campaigns to really stop the violence and get to the root of what’s going on,” she says.


Pelosi’s opinions are similar. He says there’s a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the most common forms of sexual assault.


“Around 75% of rapes occur between people who know each other, not men jumping out of bushes,” he says. “If you’re going over to visit your boyfriend, are you going to be carrying a weapon with you?”


He is also worried about the possibility that the law would lead to more suicides.


“College students are at a high risk for suicide, and I think around 57% of gun deaths are suicide,” Pelosi explains. “It’s much likelier a suicide attempt will be successful if a student uses a gun instead of drugs or cutting.”


The bill has won approval from the Assembly Judiciary Committee. It will now go to the entire Assembly, and if successful, to the Senate.
