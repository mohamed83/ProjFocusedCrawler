By Jon Fortenbury, 


There are certain things we have no control over in life.


Whereas most circumstances or events that happen to us don’t make us eligible for college funding, some do. Race and ethnicity are two of these circumstances, with several scholarships out there targeted to students of a specific race or ethnicity. Yes, you can land 
 for something you had no say in.


Below are four great scholarships for minority students.

There are just some things you can’t control, but what if you could get paid just for being you? Especially when it comes to funding college.


1. Charles H. Walker Minority Scholarship


It’s not often a law firm gives out scholarships. It’s even more rare to land a scholarship and a job at the same time.


, the first majority law firm in Columbus, Ohio to hire an African-American attorney, gives a $10,000 scholarship each year, to be applied to law school and other law school related expenses. The year that the student receives the Charles H. Walker Minority Scholarship, they are also awarded a paid associate position at Bricker & Eckler for the summer.


To be eligible to apply, you must be in your first year of legal studies at an ABA-approved law school and a minority student as defined in Equal Employment Opportunity Commissions Regulations.


It should be against the law to not apply for this scholarship if you’re a 
 who’s also a minority. It’s too good.


2. Xerox Technical Minority Scholarship


If you think Xerox can only provide you a sweet printer, you may be wrong. That is, if you can win their scholarship.


The 
 can range anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000. It requires filling out the top of the application, getting your school’s financial aid office to fill out the bottom and sending in a copy of your resume. The deadline is usually in late September.


To be eligible to apply, you must be:




A full-time student at a four-year college


Holding a B average or better


Pursuing a B.S., M.S. or Ph.D. in an engineering discipline or technical science


African American, Asian, Alaskan, Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Native American


Not already receiving scholarships or grants for tuition or tuition related expenses




With all the money you’re saving on college, maybe you can finally buy that Xerox printer you’ve been wanting.


3. AICPA Scholarship for Minority Accounting Students


Accounting students, you understand money. Therefore, you should understand the importance of landing scholarships, especially when they’re targeted to you specifically.


The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) 
 can be as high as a $5,000 award and is given out to 80 students. 


The application process has two rounds. It requires two essays, a resume, official college transcripts, copy of your green card (if applicable), graduate school admissions test scores (if applicable), copy of acceptance letters if you’re transferring or about to start grad school and a list of the scholarships or grants you’ve applied for and have received (hopefully you kept a record).


The eligibility requirements are also plentiful. 


You must be an underrepresented minority in the accounting field (such as African American, Hispanic, Native American or Asian American), be pursuing an undergraduate or graduate degree in an accounting-related field full time, have at least a 3.0 GPA and meet a number of other requirements. The website offers a full list of requirements.


If you add up the numbers, applying just makes sense.


4. Ohio Newspapers Foundation minority scholarship


Who says journalism is dead? Not the 
, who has some scholarship money to spare — and share.


The foundation’s minority scholarship is a $1,500 scholarship with a March 31st deadline. To apply, you must be a graduating senior at an Ohio high school (with at least a 2.5 GPA), who will be attending an Ohio college the following year in a newspaper-related field of study. 


You must be an African American, American Indian, Hispanic or Asian American. Two letters of recommendation and an essay are required with the application.


If you happen to be a minority student living in Ohio planning to study journalism, 
, advertising or communication, why wouldn’t you apply for this? 


Even from an objective, reporter standpoint, it seems nuts to not apply.


We have no control over where we’re born and who we’re born to, but perhaps making the best of it means applying to a number of scholarships. It’s free money, after all. 


Sure, the applications take time, but if you win, say, a $1000 scholarship that took you 10 hours to apply for, you’ve just made $100 an hour. It’s well worth your time to apply.
