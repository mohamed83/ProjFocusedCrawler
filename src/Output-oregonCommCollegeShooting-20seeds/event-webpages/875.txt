(Stan Gilliand, epa) 




epa04615278 A vigil is underway at ‘The Pit’ on the campus of the University of North Carolina in memory of Deah Shaddy Barakat, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha who were shot dead at a nearby condominium complex in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA, 11 February 2015. A man was under arrest on 11 February 2015, and charged with shooting dead three Muslim students at the University of North Carolina, local police said. The three victims – Shaddy Barakat, a dentistry student; Yusor Mohammad, his wife; and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, her sister – were killed on 10 February afternoon not far from the university’s campus. Chapel Hill police later arrested the couple’s neighbor Craig Stephen Hicks and charged him with three counts of first-degree murder. According to a preliminary investigation, the killings were motivated by a ‘neighbor dispute over parking,’ the police said. However, they noted the possibility that the crime was ‘hate-motivated.’ Mohammad Abu-Salha, the father of the two women killed, called the killings a hate-crime and noted that his daughter had told him a week ago that she had ‘a hateful neighbor,’ according to local newspapers.
