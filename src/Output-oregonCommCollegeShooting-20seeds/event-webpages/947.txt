Since age 13 and throughout my college career, I’ve held many, many bad jobs.  I’ve mopped floors at McDonalds, I’ve passed out free samples in grocery stores and, worst of all, I’ve been a cashier in New York City.  Holding four jobs at once while still going to school full-time left me with barely enough time to breathe, but more than enough time to think about my “pre-post-college” career choices.


Balancing classes, college life and living on your own for the first time can be hard, but these jobs can help make it easier to earn some money, gain relevant career experience and enjoy yourself while doing it.


1. Student tutor:
  Becoming a student tutor is the best option for students who have great academic records and love helping others. Tutors can work for a center, for their university (if it has a tutoring center) and for themselves! Business savvy students could even start their own private tutoring services.  As an added bonus, tutoring is a great way to stay sharp in a subject, especially one that you wish to pursue after college.


2. Babysitter:
 While becoming a babysitter is a bad idea for a student who hates kids, it’s a great idea for a student who is interested in a career in childcare. Additionally, it’s a great opportunity for a student to start his or her own care-taking business.  With sites like 
 and 
, students can easily find parents seeking sitters and vice versa.


3. On-campus student assistant or office assistant:
 Why not work where you study and possibly live? The convenience of working on-campus is one that any student can enjoy.  The hours are usually flexible, especially because on-campus employer is the best person to understand a student’s schedule. These positions are also a great way for students to gain invaluable office work experience, which, in most cases, will help them during the rest of their career. 


With an on-campus student assistant position also comes networking. Many college professors and staff members have connections with companies and can be valuable resources during a student’s post-college career search; connecting with them while working in their department offices can help lead a student to an internship or job.


4. Research assistant:
 Becoming a research assistant is one of the more prestigious opportunities available for student employment.  Students can often find many professors who will conduct research projects in their specific field and hire students to assist them.  Some universities even offer positions for students to assist with institutional research projects. Most of the time, these positions offer scholarships or stipends to accepted students and they are great resume and transcript boosters for virtually any student.


5. Paid intern:
  The debate surrounding whether interns should be paid is independent of the fact that some pay and some don’t.  Every student knows that the best internships are the ones that will pay students a little something while they gain a bulk of experience in their field and possibly land themselves a job within the same company.


The beauty of any of these job options is the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone.  Working while being a full-time student job and a half, but being able to combine working with gaining experience will help make college life just a little bit easier.
