More than 75% of Missouri State students are classified as student workers.


“When I really think about it, almost every single one of my friends has a job,” says MSU junior Gabby Avanzado. “It is just something that I have gotten used to.”


Of the 
, close to 80% have jobs either with the university or in the surrounding areas. And in a city like Springfield, Mo. that’s a huge number.










“A huge majority of our employees are students at either Missouri State or Ozarks Technical Community College,” says Amanda Withers, a manager at Big Whiskey’s Restaurant and Bar. “They provide a great connection to the community and are usually extremely hard working.”


Avanzado says that her role as a student employee is crucial, specific and unique.


“At the restaurant where I work, I usually tell my friends to come in a sit in my section,” Avanzado says. “It helps bring business to my company, while also getting to spend valuable time with my friends.”

But there is one small problem. College students tend to have impossible schedules.


“That’s one of the only issues we have with so many student employees,” says Withers. “Every student has an individually crazy schedule, and we have to work around each one. We don’t usually have a problem with it, and we try to keep their focus on graduating.”


“That’s one of the best parts about my job,” says Missouri State senior Taylor Vance. “I work on campus, so my boss and coworkers understand exactly what I’m going through.”


According to Clif Smart, president of Missouri State, 3,200 students work for the university. Of these students, he says that a large portion works in resident life, the John Q. Hammons area, the Hammons Student Center or the bookstore.


“It’s great to get a paycheck from a university that I write a lot of checks to,” says Vance. “Staying on campus and making some of my money back is the perfect way to work while at Missouri State.”


Junior Alissa Biermaier works for the student government association as the sergeant of arms.


“This is my second year on cabinet and I continue to do it because I love helping the students and I love bettering the university,” says Biermaier. “The fact that I get paid for this is really just a bonus.”


Other benefits — aside from an hourly paycheck — include discounts at the campus bookstore, discounted tuition and unique scholarship programs.


Each year Missouri State honors its student employees with National Student Employment Week. This year it will be in mid-April and will include an office-decorating contest, coupon giveaways for students and a “Student Employee of the Year” award.
