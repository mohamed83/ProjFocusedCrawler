Campus housing overflows force students to live in hotels

Tiffany Bautista is spending her first year of college at the University of South Florida-Saint Petersburg living in a nearby hotel.


“It’s different because I walk out into a hotel lobby every morning instead of a dorm,” Bautista says.


But that’s not to say she’s the only student residing at the Residence Hall Hilton, located in St. Petersburg, Fla.


“It still feels like college because our whole floor is occupied by college students,” Bautista says.

The Hilton hotel partnered with USFSP in 2011 to provide housing for students due to overflow and has 
. It is a three-minute drive and an eight-minute walk from the USFSP campus.


“I have to walk all the way to the dorms to do my laundry. It is so tedious having to carry all my laundry to another building”, says Bautista.


Students housed at RHH even have to park at USFSP, “ We can’t park in the Hilton parking lot so we have to park our cars in the USF garage which adds on to the walking.


RHH does come with some benefits such as weekly linen service, twice-a-week trash service, full size beds, a TV, mini-fridge, and an armchair.


Students are allowed to decorate the room but are not allowed to have typical student items such as a microwave, which can making cooking difficult according to Bautista.


The RHH is a 3 minute drive and an 8 minute walk away from the USFSP campus.


The cost of living at RHH is higher than the cost of a standard dorm room. The cost per semester in a standard dorm ranges from $3.174-$3,784  while the RHH is $4,984.


USFSP is not the only school that has housed students in hotels. Last year Boston University (BU) resorted to housing international and exchange students at the Brookline Holiday Inn.


Daphne Kook, a senior at BU, spent her junior year housed at the Brookline Holiday Inn. Kook said, “I [didn’t] really feel like I [was] a part of BU at all. I [was] just an international student taking classes and then going back to the Holiday Inn.”


The social aspect of college is a concern for most students housed in hotels.


“I think the affect it has on people’s social life depends on the person”, says Bautista, ” I feel like it hasn’t changed my social life, however, I think it could hurt certain people’s.”


The Brookline Holiday Inn is a 5-7 minute car ride and a 14-15 minute walk from Boston University’s Campus


Schools such as College of Charleston, Texas Southern, University of Vermont and Paine College have also used hotels as backup housing.


Although most colleges have resorted to hotel for a certain time period, USFSP and Boston had students residing in hotels for the entire school year.


Bautista keeps a good spirit about the issue and says she likes it, although she does wish she was closer to campus.
