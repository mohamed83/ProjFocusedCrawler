Amanda So — a rising senior at Stanford University — does not believe Facebook crossed the line when it manipulated users’ newsfeeds without their knowledge.


Facebook and two Cornell-affiliated researchers recently 
where the website altered the newsfeeds of its users to show content that was more happy or sad than normal. According to the study, happy posts use “positive” words and phrases, while sad posts contain language associated with “negative” emotions.


So says she believes Facebook was justified in conducting the experiment without notifying the nearly 700,000 members whose newsfeeds were manipulated


“Facebook already employs an algorithm to determine what shows up in your newsfeed and in what order,” she says. “This experiment simply altered that algorithm to display mainly things that are inherently positive or negative.”


So says it is “far-fetched” to call the experiment unethical. The goal of the experiment was to study to see social media websites have an effect on users’ moods.


“Social media is something in which a person
 
chooses to participate,” she says. “You sign an agreement, terms and conditions. If you don’t like them, don’t sign up. Social media platforms are businesses — they exist to make profits and they exist because they make profits.”


So adds that she uses the site on a “daily” basis and believes most other college students use the site frequently.


“Considering the prevalence of Facebook’s mobile app, I’d say almost all college students are on it at least once a day, if not multiple times a day,” she says. “There’s always just enough downtime to check the app.”


Michael Howell, a rising junior at the University of Arkansas, also says he believes Facebook’s experiment was reasonable.


“People should understand that when they join these social media websites like Facebook and Twitter, the companies can alter their sites and layouts however they please,” he says. “They talk about the ethical responsibilities of social media websites (but they) should also have personal responsibility for themselves.”


The 
 concludes that Facebook users’ moods are affected positively or negatively by the content they see in their newsfeeds. The website controls the order — and has the ability to control the types — of stories users view in their newsfeeds.


However, several organizations — such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center — believe Facebook unethically conducted the study. On July 3, 
against Facebook with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), claiming the website violated national privacy laws .


The complaint urges the FTC to investigate Facebook’s “unlawful manipulation” of user newsfeeds and publicize the algorithm that determines the order of newsfeed content.


Jack Stewart, a rising sophomore at Baylor University, says he thinks Facebook made an “ethical mistake.”


“Users should have been invited to decline or accept participation in the study and debriefed afterward,” he says. “This is standard experimental protocol.”


He adds that many Facebook users may be unaware that the social media website has the ability to manipulate its content.


“Facebook made a mistake by thinking users know
 
that the data they provide to Internet websites can be used to modify their experiences,” he says.


Like So, Stewart says the availability of a mobile app has increased his Facebook usage.


“Ever since it became mobile, I think I check it once an hour, assuming I have regular access to my phone,” he says. “I probably get into Facebook on the computer maybe once per day.”


Peter Carlson, a rising junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, also says he is “troubled” by the way Facebook conducted the study.


“These Facebook researchers conducting the study know that only a small percentage of users actually read (their) policies,” he says. “I find the way that they conducted the study rather troubling, especially since, as they admitted, the research benefits were not justified.”


He adds that Facebook should have foreseen the controversy that resulted from the experiment.


“These researchers should have had the foresight to realize that there would be backlash for manipulating almost 700,000 users and should have at least tried to show some remorse,” he says.


Though two of the study’s three authors — Jeffrey Hancock and Jamie Guillory — are affiliated with Cornell University, they did not receive approval from the university’s Institutional Review Board, which determines whether experiments are ethical.


“Because the research was conducted independently by Facebook and Professor Hancock had access only to results … Cornell University’s Institutional Review Board concluded that he was not directly engaged in human research and that no review by the Cornell Human Research Protection Program was required,” a university statement says.


Hancock is a communications professor at Cornell and Guillory is a former Cornell doctoral student.


The university has previously stated in a press release that the study had been partially funded by the U.S. Army Research Office. Since then, Cornell has edited the press release to clarify that it has not received any external funding.


“While Professor Hancock, like many researchers, has conducted work funded by the federal government during his career, at no time did Professor Hancock or his postdoctoral associate Jamie Guillory request or receive outside funding to support their work on this (paper),” Cornell spokesperson John Carberry says.
