Amid protests from students, the Ohio University Board of Trustees voted on Friday, Jan. 23, to raise tuition for all students. Incoming, in-state freshmen will pay 5.1% more than the current $10,536 tuition and fees. Students currently enrolled will pay 2% more than the current cost for tuition and fees — approximately $10,740.


“Ohio University should be held to a higher standard,” said Ryan Powers, a sophomore studying philosophy at Ohio University.


The day before the meeting, Ohio University students gathered to march and protest  — using the hashtag #RAISEHELLNOTTUITION — the guaranteed tuition hike. The protest began outside the first floor of Baker University Center and moved to Court Street and College Street, blocking traffic on both. The protest ended at the Civil War monument after police asked students to get off the street or be arrested.


“There is no way to escape the system,” said Taylor Baird, a sophomore studying psychology.


“The new rigidity of the system that the university is forcing upon will bury, but student power and love will prevail,” added Ryant Taylor, a senior studying creative writing and organizer of the #RAISEHELLNOTTUITION march. “It’s about the fact that we (students) care about each other and see through the university’s lies, that is what will bring change.”


“The Ohio University Board of Trustees is concerned about the increased burden of higher education costs being placed on students and their families. This is in large part a result of declining public funding of higher education,” said Peter C. Mather, Ph.D., Secretary to the Board of Trustees. “While tuition and fees were raised at the recent board meeting, this was accompanied by increases in scholarship money for our students demonstrating high levels of need,” Mather added.


by Ohio University Police for disturbing a lawful meeting.
