College students head to the Olympics with NBC

Bradley University alum Justine Harris, 25, spent a day carting American snowboarder Shaun White around London’s Olympic Park while interning with NBC at the 2012 Summer Olympics.


Nailing a double McTwist 1260 or a triple axel isn’t the only way for college students to score a spot in Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympics.


This year, NBC continues their tradition of recruiting college students to help with their Olympic coverage, both in the host city and back in the states.


NBC selected students from Bradley University, Ithaca College and Syracuse University to work as interns in Sochi and Stamford, Conn. — the site of an NBC broadcast and production facility — for the Winter Games. The schools have continuing partnerships with NBC where a competitive intern recruitment process begins about a year prior to when the Winter or Summer Games commence.


Students work as “runners” completing errands, “loggers” — watching, indexing and compiling highlight reels from the events — production assistants and general help throughout the course of the Games, according to Dr. Paul Gullifor, Bradley University Department of Communication chair. Students are compensated at the end of the internship with school credit.


Gullifor admitted to “pestering” NBC to consider Bradley students for two years before the network started recruiting his communication students, beginning with the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. For Sochi, NBC selected six Bradley students to work in Russia and 12 to work in Stamford.


Bradley alum Justine Harris, 25, interned with NBC in London during the 2012 Summer Olympics. She worked as both a runner completing errands for the production team and as part of the NBC Sports PR team.


Harris says her work with NBC was intense, yet enjoyable. The highlights: driving athletes such as American snowboarder Shaun White and Olympic champion Nastia Liukin around the London Olympic Park on a golf cart, attending events such as Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt’s races and filling in for Today show sportscaster Bob Costas before he arrived for a taping.

“They were waiting for him and trying to get the lighting right,” Harris says. “I’m apparently about his height and I have brown hair like he does, and I guess that was enough for them. He showed up and made some crack about being the same height as me.”


While Harris worked the 2012 Games from the field, Lindsey Smith, an Ithaca College television-radio senior, worked on the other side of the video feeds in New York City.


Smith’s job with NBC entailed watching certain events and pulling the best highlights into short, online videos. She produced a total of 76 videos throughout the Games, capturing more than 620,000 views.


Smith’s shifts, from 3 a.m. until noon the next day, accommodated the time change in London. But her office was used to late night productions — the “highlights factory,” as Smith called it, worked out of Studio 8H in 30 Rockefeller Plaza, where NBC tapes 
Saturday Night Live
. The space was transformed into a sea of computers and sound booths during the games.


“They wrapped 
Saturday Night Live
 for that season and the next day they set up the highlights factory,” Smith says. “We would actually do all our editing right on the stage where the band performed.”


Smith says working directly with NBC staff and playing a key role in orchestrating the games made up for the internship’s unpaid nature.


“It’s the Olympics, it’s the best opportunity you can ever have,” Smith says. “The best part about it is how willing the producers were to work with you. Yes, they were under so much stress … trying to get all these highlights out the door because it’s a 24-hour process, but they are so patient and willing to work with the students and teach you about the process.”


Virginia Mansfield-Richardson, associate dean of the Park School of Communications at Ithaca, says NBC has recruited Olympic interns from Ithaca College since the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy. Some interns have even become NBC employees after graduation.


Twenty-six Ithaca students traveled to Sochi and eight to Stamford. Though the students currently working for NBC are unavailable for interviews, Mansfield-Richardson says the Ithaca students arrived safely in Russia and “they’re feeling good about the security.”

Rachel Samples, 22, a Syracuse University senior studying television, radio and film, has friends working in Sochi with NBC. She also interned in London during the last Summer Olympics. Working as a runner, Samples says she sharpened her customer service skills and witnessed firsthand the global reach of the Olympics.


“Just watching the Olympics growing up, you just think it’s like a show, like a performance or the Grammys, you don’t think about all the logistics that go into it,” Samples says. “This is literally a world show … and it’s non-stop for those two weeks.”

NBC has selected Olympic interns from Syracuse since the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, according to Hub Brown, associate dean of the Newhouse School of Public Communications.


Twenty-three students traveled to Sochi and 10 to Stamford for the Games this month, a group Hub considers the “best and brightest” at Syracuse, which recruiters look for when selecting Olympic interns.


“I think what makes a student a candidate (for this internship) is a history of being willing to do more than the minimum required,” Brown says. “They really do need to show enterprise in their resumes … and show through their writing samples that they get it, that they really understand what goes on in a production of television, news and sports content.”


Harris says Bradley University helped prep students for their interviews with NBC and guided them through the recruitment process. Gullifor adds that the community has treated the Bradley students working with NBC like “rock stars,” asking them to speak at local events. He’s equally as proud to watch his students experience the Olympics.


“It’s really big for these kids and I tell them to enjoy the ride,” Gullifor says. “I sit down and watch the Olympics and I think, I got some students out there that are helping to bring those Games right into my living room. You watch it with a whole new level of appreciation and excitement.”
