Enrollment in community colleges has been steadily increasing, according to a study by the American Association of Community Colleges. With more affordable courses, partnerships with local business and industry and enrollment caps at four-year universities, it’s no wonder almost half of all undergraduate students in the United States today are served by 
.


If you are a student who wants to transfer to a four-year college, you’re not alone. A 2011 study by College Board found that four out of five students who attend community college hoped to move on to a four-year college or university.


From community college to a four-year institution


In many cases, community college students start earning credits with transfer in mind. Some colleges and universities have guaranteed transfer agreements with community colleges in the area, ensuring that most, if not all, of the credits students take at 
 will apply toward their higher degree. Whether that guarantee applies to your particular situation or not, keep these five tips in mind to make the transition from community college easier.




Find a good advisor.
 Getting through the transfer admissions process starts with a good advisor. Transfer counselors are there to help you choose the right courses, plan your next steps and get through the transition as smoothly as possible. Meet regularly with them to ensure that you are on the right track to complete your educational goals. Don’t wait until your final semester of community college to work with an advisor; your contact with transfer counselors should begin when your college career does.


Choose your courses wisely.
 Some states have articulation agreements that make it clear exactly what courses are needed, and what grades you must earn, in order to transfer those credits to a four-year college or university in your state. Ask your advisor if your state has such an agreement in place, and where you can access the information. Choose courses that you know will transfer, especially if those courses are for an intended major.


Complete your associate degree.
 Earning your associate degree can make your work easier when transfer admissions time rolls around. If you already hold an associate degree, you have likely completed all general education requirements and can enter a four-year university as a junior. In addition, those who have not earned their associate degree might have to show a higher grade point average in order to be accepted into a four-year institution.


Shop around.
 Even if your heart is set on a particular college or university, take the time to shop around with an open mind. Earning your degree through a community college might open doors to colleges you thought were closed to you. Many colleges offer transfer fairs on a regular basis; find out when they are and attend with a list of questions in hand. Making sure the right program is available at the school also matters. In some cases, you might be accepted to the college of your choice but not into the particular program you want to pursue. Make certain both the college and the program are suitable for you before you take the transfer leap.


Look for financial aid.
 Filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid is a must for any students planning to transfer their college credits. Start gathering any information you might need to complete this form long before the deadline looms. In addition, many colleges and universities set aside scholarship funds specifically for those students who transfer in from a community college. In order to determine exactly what you qualify for, the four-year school will likely need a 
 transcript from the community college. Get the ball rolling on this as soon as you can to ensure the information is in the proper hands before the deadline.




Be as prepared as possible for your transfer 


The importance of preparation for your transfer plans can’t be overstated. The College Board survey found that one of the biggest problems for students transferring from community college was the lack of appropriate transfer courses. Taking two years of courses only to find that several of them are not eligible for transfer can set your dreams back a year or more. Engaging an advisor and carefully planning your courses from the start might be the most important thing you can do to ensure a smooth and easy transition from community college to a four-year institution.
