When holiday break rolled around at The College of New Jersey, Karina Lopez headed to a friend’s couch rather than the comforts of her own home.


Lopez, like most former foster care youth, “aged out” of the system at the age of 18 and found herself homeless during school breaks and struggling to pay the costs of college all on her own.


“Moving into my dorm freshman year, I was alone. There were mothers folding their daughters’ clothing and nit-picking about where to place things. I remember vividly a daughter asking her mother to ‘leave already,’” says the 25-year-old TCNJ graduate. “I desperately wanted a parent to fold my clothes and nit-pick. I wanted what they were rejecting.”


Each year, 
 like Lopez transition out of the foster care system.  Estimates from Casey Family Programs suggest only about 
of all foster care children enroll in higher education programs. Of those, only 
 obtain a bachelor’s degree.


A 
 out of the University of the Pacific found that structured support is needed to get foster youth through college.


“(I) had many gaps in my education,” says Lopez. “While my peers had taken AP classes or courses at their local [community] college, I had an Abbott district education from approximately four high schools. I was competitive in my neighborhood, but quickly fell to the bottom of the totem pole at college.”


Lopez entered foster care at the age of 11 after being taken out of an abusive home. She retained her social worker until she turned 21, spent seven years getting her degree and joined the Army during her junior year. She depended on multiple college-based foster care programs to help her along the way.


One such program was the Summer Housing Internship Program (SHIP) at Rutgers University — a program that works with 40 students each summer. Through SHIP, Lopez received free room and board for the summer and was connected to an internship.

Although programs exist across the U.S., 20 states either lack campus-based foster-care programs at four-year institutions or there is no data available, according to 
. Only 11 out of 50 states have statewide support programs and less than half have tuition waiver programs.

A six-year program at Western Michigan University — Seita Scholars — has helped more than 250 Seita Scholars through their program since 2008. The group covers the cost of college for former foster-care youth and is considered one of the most comprehensive programs in the country.


Seita Scholars offers full-paid tuition and year-round housing to students placed in foster care on or after their 14th birthday. Each student is paired with a campus coach who teaches important life skills, such as budgeting for weekly expenses. Volunteers help each student create a financial plan, choose an academic major and develop a career path.

“Students could get a refund check during their first semester, and it could be more money than they’ve ever had at one time,” says Chris Harris, director of Seita Scholars. “We help them figure out how to utilize those funds.”


Financial limitations prevent every in-need student from being admitted to the program.


“We do have more students interested in being Seita Scholars, than we have allocations,” Harris says. “Limitations come in several forms, which include the financial dollars available to provide full tuition scholarships and the operational resources to support them.”


“There is so much entertainment attention being drawn to foster kids. There are several Disney movies and a show on ABC Family that use foster care kids to evoke emotion, but we aren’t doing anything about the issue,” says Lopez. “We all talk about it and it’s widely understood, but no one is angry.”
