For college students, being a 'good Samaritan' can be complicated

Emily Holland didn’t expect she would have to make a lifesaving phone call her second weekend at George Washington University, but when her friend got alcohol poisoning, she was faced with a difficult decision.


“There were concerns before we made the call about whether to make the call,” says Holland, now a senior. “Then there’s that idea where you don’t want to get you and your friends in trouble for something.”


Holland used the university’s 
 which exempts students from university disciplinary action if they call 911 for someone else in an alcohol related emergency. Some universities take an additional step by exempting the student in need of help from repercussions also — otherwise called 
. According to Students for Sensible Drug Policy, 
 schools have some form of a medical amnesty policy, but school policies do not pay for medical bills or provide legal protections.


While universities implement these policies to encourage students to call for help without fear of consequences during life-threatening emergencies, students like Holland can still be hesitant. Aaron Letzeiser, executive director of the Medical Amnesty Initiative, says concerns like Hollands’ are common among college students.


“In addition to your own well-being, you’re also going to be worried about if your friend is going to get mad you for calling,” says Letzeiser. “We really try to eliminate that fear of students calling.”


George Washington University does charge an “amnesty fee” to the person in need of help. University officials were unavailable to comment on the details of the fee but Letzeiser says it only creates another barrier for students. However, Betty Aldworth, executive director of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, says that any policy is better than no policy.


“If we have to choose between no amnesty policy and an amnesty policy with a fee, the choice would be an amnesty policy with a fee,” says Aldworth who also notes that a fee could still create obstacles for lower income students.


The person in need of help can only be granted amnesty once at George Washington University. The same is true at George Mason University, but GMU’s Associate Dean of Students Juliet Blank-Godlove says this limit exists so the first time can be an educational opportunity.


“Our hope is that students can learn from this and won’t find themselves in an emergency situation multiple times,” says Blank-Godlove


Blank-Godlove says a student who calls for another person must apply for amnesty and 
 to follow. The caller must request medical attention at the time of the incident, stay with the intoxicated individual and provide information to emergency personnel. A follow up meeting is then required for both students, but the final decision is determined by the Office of Student Conduct.


“We want the call to be made and, at the end of the day, this is about safety,” says Blank-Godlove. “We always want to air on the side of safety and caution.”


Some schools – like Pomona College in Claremont, Calif. — 
 where no action is taken against anyone who seeks or receives medical attention nor is there a limit on using the policy.


“(The policy is) applied broadly to encourage students to get help for themselves or for their friends,” says Christopher Waugh, associate dean of students at Pomona College.


Yet, Letzeiser says that policies shouldn’t be too vague where students could see them as being open for interpretation.


While GW, Pomona and GMU can exempt both the caller and the person who needs help, the University of Wisconsin-Madison grants amnesty only to the caller. According to Marc Lovicott, public information officer for the UW-Madison police department, the university’s 
  are on a case-by-case basis and there are no guarantees for amnesty,


“I believe the caller and the victim should be protected,” says Ryan Baumgartner, a UW Madison senior. “I think medical amnesty policies are a great way to encourage students to look out for their peers and to do the right thing.”


Parents are notified at UW-Madison if the underage individual is taken to the emergency room or detoxification, but not at the University of Virginia.


“I didn’t want to get (my friend) in trouble,” says Tomás Harmon, a 2013 U.Va. graduate who took a friend to the hospital after she became unresponsive due to drinking at a fraternity party. “But one of the (fraternity) brothers, who also happened to be an RA, told me the U.Va. Medical Center doesn’t report these types of things to the police or our parents.”


While Harmon thinks not notifying their parents will encourage students to go the ER, the hospital bills may still worry some students.


“I feel like most students will have to tell their parents if they don’t want to get reported to a collection agency,” says Harmon.


Alworth says amnesty policies are all about facing the realities of college life while allowing students to make safe decisions in difficult circumstances.


“The fact of the matter is this is what is happening on college campuses,” says Aldworth. “We will lose students and young people if we don’t adopt good policies to affect people in an emergency.”
