Millennial courtship (Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY)


The Atlantic 
ran an opinion piece Wednesday (July 2) entitled, “
.” While it’s normal for older generations to complain about younger generations, it is surprising to see these types of thoughts being expressed.


One of the most striking lines of the article reads, “Kids these days, they just don’t know how to fall in love.” What this sentiment, along with others expressed in the piece, fail to recognize is that we “kids” weren’t born specifically geared toward a hookup culture.


What I’m trying to say, is that our parents and family members need to take responsibility too and stop putting all the blame on us.


Erika Christakis, current lecturer at 
 and a former co-master at a Harvard residence hall, shared her thoughts on this topic with 
The Atlantic
. In regards to college students needing dating classes, they wrote, “Christakis thinks it’s because college students these days are too focused on resume-building and career preparation.”


This statement ignores the fairly obvious, which is surprising because it is coming from a person of such high-professional-esteem. Generally most college students attend college to find their way to a successful career. Therefore, this focus on resume-building is not only understandable, but necessary.


It’s become the American standard in our generation that jobs are hard (read: incredibly difficult) to get. Graduating college isn’t enough anymore. Graduates must prove that they’re better than the tons of other applicants competing with them. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to pay off college loans with love. If it did, I’d be the first person to focus on a relationship.


Christakis was joined by author and dating coach, Rachel Greenwald, who shared thoughts similar to her own. “[Greenwald] thinks it’s because most college ‘relationships’ now occur within the context of a brief sexual encounter, or ‘hookup’ as the youth say.”


Let’s stop and be fair for a moment. Hookup culture has existed in America for a long time now. It just operates differently and is talked about more openly. It’s not like the everyone from older generations was looking for their lifelong romantic partner in college, if you catch my drift.


All of that being said, I’m not ignorant enough to deny that we live in a hookup culture.


Apps like Tinder and Grindr make it fairly obvious that the modern-day college student is looking to meet people quickly, more often for shorter term engagements than longer ones. Despite moral oppositions to a hookup culture, there are benefits that come along with the risks. Studies that cite the 
 have recently began emerging in greater numbers.


It’s easy to place blame on college students for the movement from traditional romance, but it takes a true parent and adult to not only understand, but to also accept their part in the current relationship culture of young people. Articles and opinions like this only increase the rift between generations. We all affect one another and it’s up to all of us to help one another out.


For example, Millennials are big when it comes to introducing tech culture to older generations. Maybe instead of creating classes to try to deal with the problem older generations could similarly impart their knowledge and wisdom of relationships to young people. Anyone can judge and analyze a group that their not part of, but only the truly open-minded start dialogues and listen.

The Atlantic 
article, but what are your thoughts. Send your tweets to

), dating classes for college students, and/or the current status of romance between youth in our society.
