A North Carolina State University student died after falling from a nine-story building on Monday. According to a 
 from the university, an investigation is ongoing and there was no apparent foul play or threat to the campus.


The student —  
 
The Technician
 as sophomore engineering major Joseph Banks — fell from 
, which houses chemistry, statistics and physics classes.


Vice Chancellor and Dean Mike Mullen 
to the campus community on Tuesday, expressing his sorrows.


“During my time here at NC State I have repeatedly seen that when we experience the loss of a member of the Wolfpack, we come together and support each other. However, it is important that after time has passed and hearts and emotions begin to heal, we keep a piece of what we are feeling today as a reminder that we should always treat others with respect, dignity and care.”


On Monday night, NCSU students and faculty held a memorial vigil, which was attended by more than 450 students, according to Mullen. Students attended another vigil Tuesday night, hosted by NC State Student Government and the National Alliance on Mental Illness.


“We will be standing in solidarity and remembrance for our lost member of the Wolfpack,” NC State Student Government wrote on its 
 page.






The candlelight vigil is happening in 1 hour- Come out to Stafford Commons to be a part of the 
 community.

NC State student Ryan Gorman happened to be outside Dabney Hall on Monday afternoon when he witnessed the fall. As a result, he is lending himself as a resource for his grieving classmates.






Anyone who's ever feeling depressed or down about themselves please come talk to me. I never want to witness anything like I witnessed today

Mullen wrote to the NC State community that students should make an active effort to be inclusive to their classmates.


“Today I ask that we begin making special efforts to include those that may feel excluded,” he wrote. “Talk to someone in class you may not otherwise have talked to before today. Go out of your way to say hello and to get to know people that are different than you are. But don’t let that behavior stop after today. Take care of yourself and look to take care of each other everyday. It is our responsibility to continue to be supportive and inclusive of all members of the Pack.”
