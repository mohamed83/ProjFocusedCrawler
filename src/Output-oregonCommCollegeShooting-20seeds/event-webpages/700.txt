North Carolina has implemented some new voting laws that has caused voting complications for out-of-state students.




Voting is about to get more complicated for many North Carolina college students.


Cassandra Perkins is a University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill junior but a Maryland native, and if she wants to continue voting at college, she’s going to have to make a trip to the Division of Motor Vehicles and get a North Carolina-issued ID or reregister to vote before each election.


The state passed a sweeping voting legislation last week that will require voters to produce a government-issued photo ID card beginning in 2016, and lawmakers have specified that student college IDs will not count. Students can only use an out-of-state driver’s license if they have registered to vote within 90 days of the current election.


“I chose the state of North Carolina for college,” Perkins, 20, said. “It’s almost like a slap in the face after all the things I’ve done in this state to feel disenfranchised because I’m from out of state and because I’m younger.”


The legislation also bans same-day registration, shortens the allotted early-voting period by a week and bans pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds who will be 18 by the next election.


The bill, which Republican Gov. Pat McCrory has pledged to sign into law, will make North Carolina one of the first states to pass voting legislation following the recent Supreme Court decision that struck down key parts of the Voting Rights Act.


McCrory praised the bill at a media conference July 26, saying it would increase confidence in elections. But the governor admitted he had not seen all the clauses in the bill when asked a question by a reporter, causing speculation about how familiar he was with the legislation. McCrory signed 18 bills into law on Monday, but has yet to sign the voter ID legislation.

To obtain a North Carolina ID, out-of-state students or students without a North Carolina driver’s license will need to bring two forms of ID that prove their age and identity, proof of residency and proof of Social Security, according to the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles website.


“This bill is really just a smorgasbord of voter suppression measures,” said Adam Sotak, the organizing director at advocacy group Democracy North Carolina. “It’s going to be a hassle that students will have to be very motivated to overcome.”


In the past, students could use a college ID to register to vote and identification was not required at the polls, Sotak said. Universities could also send over a roster of their students to the state Board of Elections to help with student voter registration.


The bill’s supporters say the more stringent voter-ID regulation will prevent voter fraud. Statistics obtained by local TV station 
WNCN
 from the state’s Board of Elections show 121 voter fraud allegations were referred to the district attorney in 2012 out of almost 7 million votes.


The legislation does not make sense to many students, said Tyler Swanson, a junior at North Carolina A&T State University. Voter fraud is not prevalent and the state funds public colleges but student IDs are not considered to be state-issued in the bill, he said.


“It’s really going to mess up our voice in the political process, especially for those who live out of state,” said Swanson, 19.


Youth voting in North Carolina has been increasing in recent years. Almost 95,000 more North Carolina voters ages of 18 to 25 were registered to vote in 2012 than in 2008, according to a report from 
Democracy North Carolina
.


The decrease in available voting options has some students concerned about lower voter registration and turnout. Early voting has been shortened from 17 days to 10 days and voters can no longer register at the polls.


The majority of UNC voters use some form of early voting or same-day registration because it is faster and more convenient, Perkins said. Students from campus political groups stand outside campus early-voting locations and encourage students to register and vote all at once, she said.

Duke University senior Alina Wattenberg, co-president of Duke Political Union, said Duke also had an early-voting location on campus.


“We really did see a lot of kids voting using early voting,” said Wattenberg, 21, said. “That makes me a little nervous in terms of how that will affect the voting turnout next year.”


Still, if signed, the voter ID law wouldn’t go into effect for more than two years. Brett Pinnix, 19, a sophomore and student body vice president at UNC Wilmington, said although the law does complicate voting for students without IDs, the campus has time to prepare and inform students so they can still vote.


Swanson is planning a rally on his campus in the fall that will clearly outline the new voting regulations and encourage students to vote despite increased barriers. Swanson says he is glad he has until 2016.


“As long as we start now and work on this, I think we can turn this around,” he said.
