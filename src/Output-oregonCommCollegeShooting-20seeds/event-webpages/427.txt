Ferguson fallout: Back on campus, students tackle 'elephant in the room'

As the new academic year kicks off at colleges and universities nationwide, student journalists have begun to wrestle en masse and in depth with the reported facts and existential questions connected with the Michael Brown shooting and Ferguson protests.


A story in the 
Indiana Daily Student
 at Indiana University 
 “the elephant in the room” that demands impassioned debate. Separately, writing for the
 Iowa State Daily
, Iowa State University student Stephen Snyder 
 “a significant social experiment being played out for the entire country to watch on every news network.”


Texas State University student Xzaviar Allen says the main lesson being drawn from the experiment is simple, painful and rooted deeply in American history.


As Allen 
, “The death of Michael Brown proves that it is still unsafe for black men in America. Although his untimely death was a recent incident, it serves as a continuation of the constant harassment and abuse of the African American people, particularly the black male, at the hands of those appointed to protect and serve. … Although Darren Wilson is an officer of the law, he should face some sort of administrative punishment and finally prove that the life of a black man is not worthless by any means.”


“This is about Ezell Ford, John Crawford, Eric Garner, Renisha McBride, Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis, Jonathan Ferrell, Darius Simmons, Sean Bell, Amadou Diallo, Oscar Grant and the countless other black people who lost their lives due to systemic racism.” says Taylor Simien.

Louisiana State University junior Taylor Simien strongly agrees with Allen — and he is naming names.


As 
, LSU’s student newspaper, “What some people fail to realize is this situation has transformed into something much bigger than Mike Brown. This is about Ezell Ford, John Crawford, Eric Garner, Renisha McBride, Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis, Jonathan Ferrell, Darius Simmons, Sean Bell, Amadou Diallo, Oscar Grant and the countless other black people who lost their lives due to systemic racism. In the face of racism, black people need to stand united and fight for their rights.”




The bottom line, in Simien’s words, “Mike Brown was not the first black life racist America deemed dispensable, and it won’t be the last. It is evident that walking while black in America is a crime.”


By comparison, the staff of 
The Central Florida Future
 at the University of Central Florida cautions readers to avoid framing Ferguson as “a ‘cops vs. civilians’ problem” or “an ‘authority vs. citizens’ problem.”


As 
Future
 editors 
, “One questionable officer does not make all officers questionable. Just because one person uses poor judgment does not mean that every officer would respond the same way. … [T]here are officers who are just as outraged by the death of Brown as any other protester. … Something can be learned from events like Brown and Martin. But this situation, and others like it, shouldn’t create a distrust with the authorities. They’re there to keep citizens safe and most of them do a good job.”


Meanwhile, 
The Daily Athenaeum
 at West Virginia University argues that students’ first job in the face of a Ferguson-sized event is to learn all they can from trusted sources and “form their own decisions on the matter.”


As 
 in an editorial, “Don’t get swept up in the mob mentality of rumors and misinformation. … Just because Missouri is a few states away, doesn’t mean we should brush off this tragic story that could have occurred anywhere. With the hustle and bustle of the night life in Morgantown, who’s to say it couldn’t have happened here? … Student Body President Chris Nyden said he believes the place to change things is right here, on college campuses. After all, we are the future leaders of the country.”


Indiana University student Casey Farrington contends a solid understanding of Ferguson also must involve open discussion. Yet, as she points out in 
, at least one school district in Illinois has banned conversations about the shooting or protests during classes.


As Farrington writes in response to that district’s edict, “Silencing students doesn’t make these problems go away. If anything, ignorance of these issues, and their roots in the very foundation of our republic, make the problems worse. … Not talking about Ferguson won’t make the protests stop. It won’t improve relations between the citizenry and the police force. It won’t bring justice to Mike Brown or his family. But talking about these problems — frankly and respectfully — could prevent future tragedies from happening.”


Dan Reimold, Ph.D., is a college journalism scholar who has written and presented about the student press throughout the U.S. and in Southeast Asia. He is an assistant professor of journalism at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, where he also advises The Hawk student newspaper. He is the author of 
 (Routledge, 2013) and maintains the student journalism industry blog
