Watching the hit AMC television show 
 doesn’t at all compare with speaking to a 
 guidance counselor about college. But it never hurts to consider all angles when deciding where to attend college.


Here are a few lessons 
The Walking Dead
 teaches us (very indirectly) about choosing a college.


(By Gene Page, AMC)


Andrea (Laurie Holden) from 
“The Walking Dead.”


Definitely choose one


You may be thinking, “If the world is overrun by zombies, why even go to college?” Well, if — and maybe when — the zombie apocalypse occurs, you’re going to be glad you went to college.


While it’s unclear if any of the characters from 
The Walking Dead
 actually did go to college, it’s crystal clear they’re using some of the skills and knowledge a college degree may provide.


Take the scientist from the Centers for Disease Control or the governor’s right-hand man Milton, for example. Through scientific experiments one may learn in college, both have contributed new information about the zombie virus, which has led to some smart and life-saving decisions. And Glenn — the smart Asian — regularly displays problem-solving skills, which, who knows, he may have developed in school.


Another thing the show causes us to think about is children.


Who will 
 adolescent Carl and infant Judith as they get older? If you have a college degree or plenty of knowledge, you may be able to instruct the youth effectively and equip them to rebuild civilization after all the zombies die (or until we all turn into zombies).


Stick to closed-off campuses


As 
The Walking Dead
 has shown, when you sleep in an open area without some serious borders, you may as well say your goodbyes now.


Once the gang met up with Hershel and the family at the farm, they saw the most effective way to keep zombies out: borders. Now in the prison, with the gates and someone always on watch, they’re unstoppable — at least against the mindless undead.


You need a college like this.

No, not like a prison, but gated and secure from the outside world or perhaps even an 
. Some colleges are better secured than others. Find out if your desired school has a gate or someone who sits outside the entrance to let someone in. Does it have walls or just blend in with the rest of the city? Colleges in congested urban areas might not be the best place to be when the 
 begins, as we saw early on in the show with downtown Atlanta.


Think about these things now, along with more traditional factors for choosing a college, such as college rankings and campus culture.


Consider size and organization


The size of a college and how well prepared it is for disaster may make all the difference in your survival when zombie season hits.


Look at the “town” of Woodbury in the show. By zombie apocalypse standards, it’s a big city. They have a pretty decent-sized force, closed-off walls and a system for keeping out walkers (both human and zombie). People have roles in the community and lead a semi-normal life, except a handful of them, who lead purely evil lives.


Compare that with Rick’s group at the prison.


They’re a much smaller group of people but still relatively organized. While they have fewer people than Woodbury, they’re much more tight-knit and willing to discuss issues. Woodbury functions more like a dictatorship, where the governor essentially calls all the shots — the prison functions more like a democracy, where everyone has a say.


Apply those examples to choosing a college.


If you go too big, one of two things will happen after the zombie outbreak: There will be a lot more zombies to contend with or a larger army of people working together. A larger army of people could turn into a dictatorship or an unstoppable force when the zombies arrive. A smaller college could mean a Rick-like community open to feedback and less people to keep track of.


Not only does size and organization matter when the zombies inevitably arrive, but these factors are important to consider beforehand as well.


Some people prefer small colleges, with small classes and easy access to all their professors. Others prefer lecture halls and the opportunity to meet countless amounts of people.


Whether you prefer small and organized or large and free, be alert once you get to whichever college you choose.


Because some of us believe it’s only a matter of time until fictitious zombie TV shows turn into reality. Then you’ll definitely be glad you made the right 
decision.
