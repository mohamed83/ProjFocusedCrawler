U.S. college students today smoke weed at a higher rate than at any time in the past 35 years, surpassing daily cigarette smoking for the first time in 2014.


But students are into more than pot. The study also shows ecstasy and cocaine use are rising. They’re imbibing less, though: Consumption of alcohol, the quintessential party drink, is on the decline.


Those findings were revealed Tuesday in 
, an ongoing study from the Univ. of Michigan.


TRENDING: 


The national survey looked at the drug use of approximately 1,500 students enrolled full time at 2- and 4-year colleges. 
Here, we break it down for you:


Marijuana


The study shows that grass is big on campuses. “Daily or near-daily” marijuana use was reported by 5.9% of college students in 2014 — the highest rate since 1980, the first year that complete college data were available in the study.


That translates to one in every 17 college students who smoke marijuana at least 20 times each month. 


“Most of what people hear today is what the benefits are,” Lloyd Johnston, the principal investigator of the study, tells USA Today College. “Young adults are seeing marijuana as less dangerous.”


That view is shared by the general U.S. adult population, according to a 
 poll conducted in March. It notes that a majority of Americans (53%) support marijuana legalization, and that 
s
even in 10 believe alcohol poses more risk to personal health than does marijuana.

The Univ. of Michigan data also show that the percent using marijuana once or more in the prior 30 days in which the study was conducted rose from 17% in 2006 to 21% in 2014. Use in the prior 12 months rose from 30% in 2006 to 34% in 2014.


Ecstasy and cocaine


Ecstasy (MDMA, or Molly), had somewhat of a comeback in use among college students from 2007 through 2012, with past 12-month use more than doubling from 2.2%  in 2007 to 5.8% in 2012, before leveling, the study found. Previously, ecstasy had fallen from favor among college students.


Past-year use of cocaine showed a statistically significant increase from 2.7 % in 2013 to 4.4% in 2014.


Johnston says that this could be due in part to “generational forgetting” — or a younger generation not remembering, or not knowing about, any problematic issues associated with the drugs in the past.


Alcohol


The percentage is still significant, but in 2004 
63% of college students reported having an alcoholic drink within the past 30 days, down from 67% in 2000.


Binge drinking, defined as having five or more drinks in a row within the past two weeks, has also been on the decline. In 1980, 44% of students reported binge drinking. In 2014, that number was down to 35%. 


 


 is a research program conducted at the Univ. of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research. It comprises several ongoing series of annual surveys of nationally representative samples of 8th- and 10th-grade students (begun in 1991), 12th-grade students (begun in 1975), and high school graduates into adulthood (begun in 1976). The current monograph reports the results of the repeated cross-sectional surveys of high school graduates since 1976 as we follow them into their adult years.
