ROBINSON, Ill. (AP) — A southwestern Illinois community college will offer a petroleum drilling technology, or fracking, degree.


WTHI-TV reports (
 ) that Lincoln Trail College’s program will have its first students this fall. The state of Illinois signed off on long-await rules for high-volume oil and gas drilling, or fracking, last year.


Lincoln Trail College President Kathryn Harris says state officials approved the school’s petition for the degree. Harris says the program will help people get the skills needed to find a job in the fracking industry.


Those who complete the program will earn an Associate in Applied Science Degree.


Lincoln Trail College is in Robinson in Crawford County about 40 miles south of Terre Haute, Indiana.
