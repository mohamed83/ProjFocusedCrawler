Get savvy about student credit cards(Adam Gault/OJO Images, Getty Images)


Class is back in session, and it’s high time you got your finances in order. Just 58% of students from four-year colleges say they are prepared to manage their money, according to a recent 
. It’s your turn to buck the odds.


In between decorating your dorm room and catching up with friends, consider taking advantage of these five money management hacks to start your semester off right.


1. Get a bank account that serves your needs


Choose a bank or credit union that will fit your financial needs while you’re in school. 
 may offer benefits such as lower fees, free ATM access, no overdraft fees, mobile access and more. Look for financial institutions that are easily accessible or have ATMs nearby. But just because a local bank’s ATM is on campus doesn’t mean it will necessarily be right for you.


NEWS: 


“If you’re from out of state, you’ll want a bank that’s more regional or national as opposed to a local bank,” says Phil Schuman, director of financial literacy at Indiana University.


Once you have a bank account, track your balance. Twelve percent of respondents in the EverFi and Higher One study said they never check their bank balances because they’re too nervous. You won’t have anything to be afraid of if you make a budget and stick to it. Connect your bank account to a 
, such as Mint, to track your spending, set up low-balance alerts and make sure you never overdraw your account.


2. Get savvy about student credit cards


If you want to start building credit, a 
 can be the way to go, as long as you choose and use it wisely. The 
 charge no annual fees, have low balance transfer fees and have low annual percentage rates (APRs).


“If students do decide to get a credit card that’s not secured, we tell them focus on cards that don’t have high interest rates, focus on cards that don’t have annual fees,” Schuman says. “Don’t get caught up in the rewards game or the bells and whistles that go along with it. You want something that’s very bare bones. You want something that will encourage you to have good habits.”


It’s not as easy to get a 
 when you’re a student as you might think. Typical credit cards are “unsecured,” and their limits are based on your income level and credit history. If you don’t have a credit history, you’ll likely have to start with a secured card. With this type of card, you put down a cash deposit, which acts as your limit, and use it the same way as you would an unsecured credit card. The difference is, when you graduate to an unsecured card, you receive your cash deposit back.


TRENDING: 


To qualify for an unsecured card, you can get a cosigner or ask to be added to someone else’s credit card as an authorized user. With either of these options, another person will be legally responsible for your credit use. Be sure to set up mutual expectations with your cosigner or main cardholder and be a responsible user to preserve the relationship.


Your 
 is a great place to create good credit habits. Students are more likely to have outstanding balances on their credit cards and are less likely to pay credit card bills on time and in full, according to the EverFi and Higher One study. Both of these things affect your credit score in the long run and will make it difficult to do things like rent apartments and get car loans and mortgages.


3. Shop for back-to-school supplies more wisely


To 
 on back-to-school items, you have a few options. One of the best tools at your disposal? Your student ID card.


“Always ask for student discounts and you’ll be surprised,” says Louis DeNicola, writer for the deals site Cheapism.com. He suggests researching grocery stores, department stores, tech retailers and others to find out what kind of deals are available exclusively to students. For example, you can find tech deals on laptops, tablets and more on education-specific webpages such as 
, 
, 
 or 
.


You can also find discounts using couponing and sales phone apps such as RetailMeNot, Shopular or Coupon Sherpa. “College students don’t want to clip coupons or print them, but there are so many coupon apps for restaurants, department stores and grocery stores right on your phone,” says Andrea Woroch, a consumer savings expert.


4. Take only what you need in student loans


There’s no easy alternative when you need a 
. If you’ve exhausted all of your options — such as choosing a less expensive college, working and studying, and depending on your family — taking out student loans may still be a financial reality. However, you can minimize the amount of debt you’ll have.


First, exhaust your FAFSA options so you have to take out fewer private loans. Then, most importantly, take on only as much money as you will need for the year. If you’re offered a large loan, you don’t have to accept the full amount.


NEWS: 


“There’s a temptation to borrow what’s offered versus what you actually need, but you’ll have to pay that money back and it will cost you more in the long run,” Schuman says.


5. Compare your textbook rents


Long gone are the days of buying exorbitantly priced new textbook editions on the promise you can sell them back to the college bookstore for a fraction of what you paid. There are plenty of options available for rentals, e-books, used and new textbooks, such as campusbookrentals.com, Chegg, Amazon, Tun.com and others.


In fall 2014, only 8% of students opted to rent all of their course materials during that semester, according to a study by the 
. You might write off your school’s bookstore as having only pricey new versions or a limited selection of used, but according to the association, you can usually find the same alternative options that online retailers offer, including rentals and digital versions.


“College stores also offer a price-comparison tool that allows students to one-stop shop the different formats to can see how competitive the college store really is,” says Elizabeth Riddle, director of the National Association of College Stores’ research arm OnCampus Research. She adds that college stores may also work with faculty to offer custom course packs that can be printed on site, rather than purchasing entire books.


However, to reap the most savings, you may need to purchase or rent your books from multiple sources. Compare prices from online options and your college bookstore to see where you can find the best deals.
