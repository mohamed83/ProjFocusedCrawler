College life is filled with an unending stream of serious issues, lighthearted frustrations, significant events and viral trends. The College Problems Podcast wades into this stream with a regular series of spirited chats attempting to make sense of it all, while also offering story ideas to student journalists and advice for undergrads on staying safe and sane.


The podcast is hosted by a pair of younger educators and digital media geeks who view the collegiate sphere through the lenses of journalism and personal safety.

 a “silent crime on college campuses.”


Expanding upon that discussion, we tackle two new problems in our current podcast segment.


1) The ongoing debate about whether to ban or allow laptops in the classroom.


A bit more than a month ago, Tal Gross, an assistant professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University, made a New Year’s resolution to no longer allow students to use laptops during class. As he 
, “Since most students can type very quickly, laptops encourage them to copy down nearly everything said in the classroom. But when students stare at the screen of their laptops, something is lost. The students shift from being intellectuals, listening to one another, to being customer-service representatives, taking down orders. Class is supposed to be a 
conversation
, not an exercise in dictation.”


2) The mistakes students make with their digital devices that leave them vulnerable to hacking and theft.
