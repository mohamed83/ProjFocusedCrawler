Norman Shafto was in disbelief. After months of filling out numerous applications, a representative from Columbia University was calling to inform him that he been accepted. Shafto, unlike the 2,400 hundred freshman students entering Columbia this fall, spent two years at a community college before making the decision to transfer. 


With one in three students switching colleges during their undergraduate career, making an informed decision can be the difference between an easy transition and a poor fit. Shafto, who graduated Bergen Community College in Paramus, N.J. with a 3.8 GPA, had worries about the challenges of applying to a new school.


“Applying to top tier schools, despite your lack of faith in being accepted by them, can often bring unbelievable rewards. Once I had been rejected by schools like UPenn and Cornell, I never expected to receive a cheerful phone call from Columbia” says Shafto, 21. 


Although the rate can be low, acceptance appears to stem from a clear goal and preparation.

The process of applying as a transfer student differs from the process during high school. Once a student has accumulated two or more semesters worth of credits, most colleges do not place a large emphasis on high school grades and SAT scores.


When preparing the application, it is important to note that the process is multi-staged and can take weeks to complete. The following are some guidelines on how to make the process easier and increase your chances.


First and foremost, research thoroughly.
 You must have a major in mind. Doing research well in advance will save you time later on and will help narrow down your options, saving you numerous $75 application fees. 


Look for articulation agreements.
 Top schools such as Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown and NYU all have articulation agreements with local community colleges to accept credits and offer scholarships to certain niches, such as members of Phi Theta Kappa. 


Market yourself.
 Along with joining clubs, an easy way to enhance any application is to enroll in honors courses. This shows the college you are applying to that you enjoy a challenging course load and will also give you a taste of what to expect at a four year university. 


Choose the right classes.
 Check the universities you are interested in to see if there are required courses for transfer. Many colleges ask for a statistics course, a year of biology and a psychology course. By taking these ahead of time, you will automatically be a step ahead of those without prerequisites.


Get your associate’s degree.
 Students often look to transfer as soon as possible, but by staying in community college for the full two years you gain credits, often at a lower rate that a four year counterpart. 


Once you have a solid list of colleges to apply to, the final part are the applications themselves. Former NYU Steinhardt Transfer Director and current Director of Admissions at St. Thomas Aquinas College Bart Grachan discussed the review process during an interview with the Bergen Torch last December. 


“We’re looking at the complete application, with an eye towards who you are, what you’ve accomplished, and really where you’re headed. Students who are applying without a clear sense of why, or to what end, are at a disadvantage,” Grachan says.


On that note, the essay can be the most important part of a transfer application. You must know the reason you want to transfer, the program you wish to enter and campus life. The essay can be the difference between acceptance and rejection for a close applicant. A strong essay details your previous experience and how you will fit into the college they are applying to. Colleges want to be sure you want to be in their program and that you are applying for the right reasons.


The last note is to be proactive. While the application is online, you will need to obtain written recommendations from two professors, complete a college official’s report and mail out copies of your high school and college transcripts. To avoid a last minute rush, begin the application at least six weeks before deadline.
