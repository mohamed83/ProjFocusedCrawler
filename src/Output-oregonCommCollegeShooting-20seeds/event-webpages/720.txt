Dear high school graduates, it's not too late for college this fall

More decades ago than I wish to admit to, I left Paoli, Penn. for Durham, N.C. on a stiflingly hot summer day. Then, I was a student entering college. Now I am a college president.


Both of these opportunities began in the heat of the summer. Why not May 1, you may ask? Isn’t spring the season for college admissions? Why so late?


For me, the admissions season was the humid, hot summer of 1973. I was admitted to Duke University in August — and left for campus only one week later. That left me very few days to pack for the full-day drive to a campus I had never seen.


Why was I a late admit? It was not because I was a lousy student (I graduated third in my class) nor because I was from the wrong part of the country or the wrong high school (more than 20 of my high school peers went off to the same school I eventually attended). Might it have been because I was only the second in my family to attend college, and, as a first generation college goer, did not understand what was happening? Perhaps because I needed financial aid?  That I was rejected elsewhere, and didn’t want to attend my ‘safety school’?


RELATED: 


I refuse to consider that it might have been the fear and anxiety behind college applications or the procrastination that still features in my survival strategies in the face of difficult choices.


Looking back, I can imagine more reasons now than I could then for why it was August before I was admitted to what is now my alma mater. I know more, for example, about how colleges craft their entering classes and the realities of their decisions. But, still, I do not know why I was admitted to college in August to start in . . . August.


I do, though, know this: I was an August admit and there are others out there who will be as well, even now, decades later.  When they reach the time of their 40
th
 high school reunion, as I did a bit ago, I hope that like me, they look back thinking of late admission not as a regret but as an enormous victory.


RELATED: 


That August so long ago, I had no idea what doors would open to me because of the phone call inviting me to campus just a week later. They took a chance on me and I am the better for it. I now carry a responsibility to those students out there today, well after the so-called decision date of May 1, when all over the country some high school students were feted for the places they chose while others quietly worried about what they would do this coming fall.


Some will work. Some will head for 
 or similar programs. Some will take a gap year. Some, though, will go to one of the hundreds of colleges that offer — as mine does — “rolling admissions.”  There are no deadlines; we accept applications all year long for the next semester.


According to the National Association for College Admission Counseling’s 
, more than 350 U.S. colleges are still accepting students for Fall 2015.  So it’s not too late, procrastinators. Our doors are still open to you.


Susan Henking is the president of Shimer College in Chicago.
