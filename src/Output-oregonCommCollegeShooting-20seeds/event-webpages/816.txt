Two unnamed female students enrolled in 
 said they were forced to undergo “invasive 
 procedures” as part of a medical training program.


According to 
 in fall 2013 the Plaintiffs expressed concern to Barbara Ball, the chair of Valencia State’s medical diagnostics sonography program, about having to undergo the vaginal probes. The lawsuit states that students were uncomfortable with many things, one being that male students would probe the female Plaintiffs “on a regular basis.”


“In some cases, the student would have to sexually ‘stimulate’ Plaintiffs in order to facilitate inserting the probe into Plaintiffs’ vaginas,” the suit said. “Plaintiffs experienced discomfort and embarrassment each time they had to endure this forced probing of their sexual organs.”


“Defendant Ball told (the) Plaintiffs they could find another school if they did not wish to be probed,” the suit claims.


Linda Shaheen, the clinical and laboratory coordinator for the Medical Diagnostic Sonography Program, reportedly said the probes were voluntary, however, the students said that was not the case.


According to the report, the Plaintiffs said they were told if they didn’t submit to the probes, Ball and Shaheen threatened to lower the student’s grades, and it would “interfere with their future employment opportunities if (the students) did not submit to the classroom vaginal probes.”


During acceptance into the sonography program, the students had to review the program’s guidelines and requirements. The Plaintiffs said in the lawsuit that they attended an orientation where a second-year student, Jennifer Astor – also nicknamed the “TransVag Queen” – told the students that faculty believed the students should undergo the probes “in order to become better sonography technicians.”


Chris Dillingham, the women’s attorney, 
 that “although it was stated in orientation (the procedure) was voluntary, it became increasingly clear it was not. This is a very expensive program, these are young women. … I’m not a doctor, but they have suffered significant psychological damage.”


Carol Traynor, public relations director for Valencia College, says in an e-mailed statement that the school has not been served with a lawsuit, therefore, they are unable to comment on the allegations of the individuals who filed it.


Traynor says with regard to Valencia’s Diagnostic Medical Sonography program, the college released the following statement:


“The use of volunteers — including fellow students — for medical sonography training is a nationally accepted practice. Valencia’s sonography program has upheld the highest standards with respect to ultrasound scanning for educational purposes, including voluntary participation and professional supervision by faculty in a controlled laboratory setting. Nonetheless, we continue to review this practice and others to ensure that they are effective and appropriate for the learning environment.”


“We have no other statement at this time,” Traynor says.


The
 
 reports that both students resigned from the school’s sonography program.
