On Nov. 13, 
Inside Higher Ed
 
 that administrators at Pensacola State College told faculty that they are in violation of Florida state law by speaking with student journalists regarding faculty contract negotiations.


Negotiations at the school are currently at an impasse, 
Inside Higher Ed
 reported, and the administration’s memo to faculty appears to be in reaction to 
 in 
The Corsair
, Pensacola State’s student newspaper, which reported that 34 of 35 voters on the Pensacola State Faculty Association said they would vote “no confidence” in President Ed Meadows.


The situation at Pensacola State highlights a common struggle for student journalists: where exactly is the line between student and journalist?


Katherine Brown, a junior at the University of Florida who has written for 
The Alligator
 and is currently an editor at Her Campus UFL, says that being a student journalist can be both a help and a hindrance.


“Sometimes, it really helps to be a student because it means I know who to talk to about issues, what resources are available to me and it can help persuade a source to speak with me more freely,” Brown says. “At the same time, however, it can also really hurt my chances of talking to some people because it hurts my credibility as a journalist. People assume that because I’m a student, I either don’t know what I’m doing or I’ll somehow twist what they say, which couldn’t be more untrue.”


Shauna Mitchell, a senior at Fairfield University and editor-in-chief of 
The Fairfield Mirror
, agrees, saying the influence of her student status depends on the story and the interviewee.


“On the one hand, as a student I know exactly who all the important people are,” Mitchell says. “I know my dean of students personally, I know my public safety officers personally, so there’s a rapport there that you can’t always have established when you’re a professional journalist covering a one-time story on a college campus. But I’ve personally been involved in some highly sensitive stories where administrators refused to talk to me because I’m a student, and we couldn’t do a story because we had no on-the-record sources. It becomes a juggling act.”


Joe Vitale, a junior at Fordham University and managing editor of 
The Fordham Ram
, says that being a student is largely a disadvantage when reporting on campus issues.


“Largely it is a disadvantage for a number of reasons,” Vitale says. “One is that, as seen as in the case of (Pensacola State), students are often seen as threats to the authority on campus.  Because of their presence — and campus publications do hold a considerable amount of presence — administrators are likely to be wary of giving student journalists an opportunity to portray them as unfavorable actors in the school.”


Furthermore, Vitale says that student journalists naturally lean more favorably toward student viewpoints than those held by administrators.


“On top of this, most student journalists are typically on the side of other students,” Vitale says. “They are rarely independent actors in this. Because they can be benefited from covering some stories or covering it with a certain focus, student-journalists typically tend to do this. Whether this is up to par with journalistic ethics is not so simple. But there is little denying that it exists.”


Despite these concerns, Vitale says he finds comments from Pensacola State administrators “an insult to student journalists.”


“Admin should trust students to cover issues they find are appropriate,” Vitale said.


Mitchell agrees.


“It’s the responsibility of journalists, especially student journalists, to hold people accountable,” she says.


Mitchell also says that with perseverance, student journalists can prove their mettle.


“Don’t get discouraged when higher-ups and administration won’t talk to you,” Mitchell says. If they refuse to comment, put that in your story… that will definitely make them a little more eager to talk to you next time, and you can print it because it’s the truth.”


James Torrez, a junior at University of Florida and reporter for WUFT, says student status only impedes student journalist as much as they allow it to.


“I truly believe as long as you ask questions with conviction, be a great listener, and report the truth, you will be respected as a journalist, because that’s how you are presenting yourself,” Torrez says. “The title of a college student doesn’t prohibit you from anything.”
