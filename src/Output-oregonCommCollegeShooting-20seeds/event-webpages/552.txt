Some stress in college is inevitable.


Not all stress is bad, though, according to an April 2014 article in Psychology Today. There’s unhealthy stress, which could interfere with concentration and sleep, higher blood pressure and cause headaches. And there’s healthy stress, which is a managed-and-balanced stress that can motivate, lead to personal growth and can be achieved by learning how to cope.


To achieve that healthy stress, here are three of the best tips on managing stress as a college student.


1. Get organized


A lack of organization may lead to an overwhelming level of stress, according to Jacci Turner, a licensed counselor in Reno, Nevada. who has worked on college campuses for 30 years.


“The career office at your school will have people willing to help,” Turner said. “Or ask a very organized friend to help you. Write down your due dates and then break down the assignments into steps so you don’t get to finals week with three huge papers due.”


Turner also recommends using an online scheduler or calendar to get organized. A couple of options you may want to consider are Day Viewer (DayViewer.com) and Google Calendar. You may also benefit by using a spreadsheet to keep track of due dates and assignments, such as Microsoft Excel and Zoho Docs (Zoho.com).


Ditching the clutter, if nothing else, may at least diminish stress.


2. Live a healthy lifestyle


How you treat your body can contribute to your stress level, one way or another.


WebMD states, “Your body can fight stress better when it is fit.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises to manage stress by eating a healthy, well-balanced diet, exercising regularly and getting plenty of sleep. The University of Florida Counseling and Wellness Center states that many college students feel overwhelmed, eat poorly and don’t get enough sleep, which causes “a limited ability to cope with stressful events.”


“You can’t expect your car to run on watered down gas and you can’t keep overtaxing your body and expect to stay healthy,” said Turner, who tells college students that the best way to prevent stress is eating and sleeping well and exercising.


Another thing you may want to consider is breathing techniques. They’ve been known to relax people and reduce stress. Mayo Clinic has a list of different relaxation techniques you may want to try, such as thinking of a peaceful setting while undergoing focused breathing or by relaxing each muscle in your body one at a time. There are plenty of videos that can teach you relaxation techniques, such as this deep muscle relaxation technique posted by Youth Space on Vimeo.


The mind and body are closely connected, so be sure to not disregard the body when dealing with the stress of the mind.


3. Cut back and make time for fun


Sometimes, no matter how good you are at time management and no matter how organized and healthy you are, you’ll still deal with unhealthy stress. We’re only human. So if you can’t do it all, then don’t. Cut back, according to Turner.


“Too many students overbook their lives with no margin left for emergencies,” Turner said. “If you’re taking 21 units, 
 and trying to have a social life, and then your mom gets sick, how will you have any margin to help? Slow down and take a reasonable amount of credits.”


Now, don’t go out and drop all your classes or anything crazy like that. But if you’re overbooked, figure out what’s important and make some changes. You may even want to replace obligations with fun activities, like extracurricular sports or student clubs.


Don’t get behind on your graduation track for fun, necessarily, but recognizing where to add fun and where to subtract obligation is crucial. Because having fun can help you managing stress, according to the University Health Services office at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.


“Remember to allow space for both studies and fun,” said Turner, who reinforces the importance of extracurricular activities to students she’s counseling.


If you can’t manage stress on your own through organization, healthy practices, cutting back and making time for fun, then Turner recommends seeking professional help at your campus counseling office.


“You are not alone and there is help,” Turner said.
