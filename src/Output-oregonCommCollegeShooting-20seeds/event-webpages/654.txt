It’s that time of year again, when the leaves are turning, punch bowls are filling and college students nationwide are donning costumes they’ve been working on for weeks, if not months. We all know the famous line from Mean Girls: “Halloween is that one night a year when you can dress like a total sl*t and no one can say anything about it.” But who really wants to be another carbon copy wearing lingerie and mouse ears?


If you want to stand out from the crowd with your friends, read on for the best Halloween costume ideas of this year and get inspired!




1. Nicki Minaj 


Nicki Minaj’s songs have long been the soundtrack for nights at the club and joy rides with your pals. But can you impersonate her? She’s known for her wild fashion choices and hair colors that look they belong on one of those potbellied trolls from the 80’s, so why not give the Nicki Minaj look a try? There’s a good chance this is the last time you’ll ever be able to pull off neon blue hair and bright pink lipstick at the same time, not to mention a sequin two-piece and 4-inch heels. Now’s the time to pull out some fake nails, one-wash hair dye and plenty of jewelry.


2. Black Swan 


We all watched as Natalie Portman pliéed her way to greatness on the big screen last winter. She wowed us with her mad ballet skills, stunning beauty and fabulous costumes. If you’ve ever had dancing aspirations or if you just loved the feathers that sprung up on her arms as she spun around toward the end of the movie, consider giving the Black Swan look a try. You will probably have luck finding a tutu at Goodwill or another thrift store. Don’t be shy with the black eyeliner, either. Make Natalie proud.


3. Angry Birds 


This one will definitely require a few dedicated friends and plenty of preparation time. For addicts of this viral video game, though, it’ll be worth it. First, pick whether you’ll be the regular red, huge red, yellow, egg or green bird. Or maybe you’ll decide to be one of those weird green pigs with the mustache or the hardhat. If you’re feeling extra daring, you can pretend to launch yourself across the room and bump into your friends in true Angry Birds fashion. Angry Birds costumes can be found at Toys R’ Us and many popular costume shops, but it’d be more fun and original to make your own. Try raiding craft stores for fabric and whip out your basic sewing skills, or employ the skills of a crafty friend or family member.


4. Beyonce and her baby


Plenty of Beyonce-loving college students emulated the no-longer single lady last year with leotards, big hair and bling, but now the lovely triple-threat has gone domestic. This doesn’t mean you can’t imitate her fabulous style and diva standing. First step: go get the loveliest dress you can find on a college-student’s budget. I recommend Goodwill; they almost always have really elaborate evening gowns in stock, often for less than $10! Once you’ve got the dress, find sky-high heels and either work your long hair or add drugstore-brand extensions for an extra glam factor. Put on shiny chandelier earrings and maybe a gold bracelet or two. Keep the makeup simple but sexy, and once you have all of those basic elements, add the baby bump. This can be accomplished with a snug tank top and plenty of padding, using cotton or extra clothing. Wedding and engagement rings would be an added bonus. You’ll get plenty of laughs while representing one of hip-hop’s leading ladies.
