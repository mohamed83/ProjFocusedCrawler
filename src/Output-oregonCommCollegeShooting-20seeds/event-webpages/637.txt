Civic Stadium was built in 1938 and in October 2008 was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  Then disaster struck.  On June 29, 2015, Civic Stadium was destroyed by fire. 




But it will rise again.


















The Eugene Civic Alliance is planning on rebuilding with your help.  Join KEZI 9 News anchor Matt Templeman at “play on” Civic Day,  October 4th from 12p to 4p at the Civic Stadium site.  We are celebrating what was and what will be with food & drink, music, kids games & activies, firefighters and so much more.  Bring your Civic stories and memories to share at the Civic Story Booth & Road Show. 




 




The event is free.  
 to download tickets that can be used to enter giveaways at the event.
