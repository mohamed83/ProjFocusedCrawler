There’s a lot school has taught us. But there’s plenty more it hasn’t — namely, how to cook.


Unless you took a home economics class in high school, you were probably never taught a lot about cooking. You may have learned quite a bit about nutrition per the No Child Left Behind bill, but applying that knowledge to your life can be difficult and very problematic for college students. We’re frequently in a rush.


RELATED: 


I constantly find myself running between classes, out the door, and to or from work. Maybe you’ve even checked your watch and realized like me that it’s 2 in the afternoon and you’ve just had coffee all day. Then you’ll find yourself in line at some café on campus or a fast food joint somewhere around. The café sounds a bit nicer, but a lot of the baked goods carried will be high in sugar so there’s not much benefit from stopping in there either. So we students need another option. We need to learn to cook and learn to make time to cook.


For apartment residents, cooking is a bit easier as you will probably have more appliances and space to cook in than doom room dwellers. For the folks in a dormitory, you’re going to have to make do with whatever appliances are provided by your university. If you’re lucky, some universities have communal kitchens in their dorms to facilitate frugal use of student meal plans and promote healthier living.


RELATED: 


If not, you’re likely going to be working with a refrigerator, freezer, coffee maker, and microwave. The recipes and ideas I’m going to share with you will operate on the assumption that dorm students have only these four appliances and that apartment dwellers will also have counter space and a stove/oven combination.


FOR DORMS


1. Microwave Granola


Breakfast is a must. Running out to an early class without breakfast is tough on your body. You’ve been asleep for 6-8 hours and you burn a surprising number of calories as you sleep. This means that you’re going to be hungry, even if you don’t feel that way. Granola is a great way to get the nutrition you need to start the day off on a good foot. The great thing about granola is that you can do whatever you want to it.


Ingredients:




½ cup of butter


¾ cup of brown sugar


¼ cup honey (or substitute the brown sugar with honey and make it 1 cup)


¼ cup water


½ teaspoon of salt (for taste, if desired)


½ teaspoon cinnamon


3 cups oats (old fashioned oatmeal in the grocery store)


1 cup bran flakes


Nuts of your choice (cashews, peanuts, sunflower seeds, etc.)


Dried fruit of your choice (cranberries, raisins, blueberries, etc.)

Process: 
Combine butter, sugar, honey, salt, cinnamon, and water in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for four minutes, stir, and microwave for four more. Mix in all other ingredients except fruit. Microwave on high for two minutes, stir, and microwave for two more. Mix in fruit. Spread out on a sheet of aluminum foil with the edges rolled up to allow to cool. Store in bags.


2. Lettuce Wraps


A healthy lunch to make quickly and enjoy on the go.


Ingredients:




Iceberg or Romain Lettuce, a few large leaves


Tomatoes, diced


Red onion, sliced


Thousand Island dressing (or your choice)


Cucumbers, sliced


Black olives




Process:
 Lay out your large lettuce leaf or leaves (overlap if multiple). Spread out your veggies, add dressing, roll, and cover in saran wrap. Makes a perfect vegetarian lunch on the go.


3. Microwave Ratatouille


Some of you will inevitably see this dish and think of a certain Pixar movie. This French dish is perfect for summer when vegetables are abundant in the stores. It’s nutritious, delicious and easy.


Ingredients:




1 yellow onion


2 cloves of garlic


3 sundried tomatoes in oil (sub a little more oil and tomato if you can’t find this in the grocery store)


¼ cup olive oil


1 teaspoon of thyme


1 small eggplant


1 small zucchini


1 yellow squash


2 plum tomatoes


Salt & pepper to taste




Process:
 Place onion, thyme, garlic, salt, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and sundried tomatoes (leave out tomatoes if sundried are omitted) into a microwave safe dish, cover, and cook on high for seven to 10 minutes until onions are translucent. Meanwhile, toss tomatoes, zucchini, squash, and eggplant in a dish with the remaining oil, salt, thyme, and pepper.


Then, layer the cooked onions in a tray (you can improvise if needed) and cover with layers of alternating vegetables. Cook on high for nine to 14 minutes. For cooking time, on low watt (700ish) microwaves use the lower. For higher wattage, use the higher end.


4. Chocolate Coffee Mug Cake


(Thinkstock)


 
A great reward for a job well done.


Ingredients: 




¼ cup of flour


2 tablespoons of sugar


2 tablespoons of cocoa powder


¼ teaspoon of baking powder


5 tablespoons of milk


2 tablespoons of vegetable oil


1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Dash of salt


Nutella spread




Process:
 Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large coffee mug with a fork. Add the milk, oil, and vanilla in and stir until clumps have disappeared. Place in microwave on high with paper towel under mug and over mug. Microwave for approximately 60 seconds.


Watch this
 like a hawk! If it overflows or blows up, the mess will be tremendous. If you think it needs more time, stick a tooth pick in it. If it comes out with no goo sticking to it, it’s done. If not, add 10 seconds until complete. After 80 seconds you’ve probably dried out the cake. Add Nutella to the top and dig in.

FOR APARTMENTS


A bit more ambitious and a bit more involved, but a lot more rewarding.


1.
 
Quiche


This is a favorite dish of mine. It’s French in origin, but it’s now internationally known. Pronounced kee-sh, it’s an egg based dish similar to a pie.


Ingredients:




Pre-made pie crust (if you can, you can make your own)


Bacon


1 cup shredded Swiss cheese


1 cup ripped, raw spinach


1/3 cup minced onions


2 whole eggs


2 egg whites


2 cups cream


Pinch of salt


1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper




Process
: Place the pie crust in a lightly buttered pie plate (easy to find in the baking section of the grocery store). Fry bacon and chop. Combine the remainder of the ingredients and set aside. Bake the crust for two to four minutes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit to harden just slightly.


RELATED: 


Once it’s done, pour the remainder of the ingredients in the crust and bake for 15 minutes. Once the timer goes off, reduce heat to 300 degrees and continue to bake for 30 more minutes.


2. Hamburger Stroganoff


Growing up this was one of my favorite recipes to do. It’s simple, tasty, and good with broccoli.


Ingredients: 




1 can of cream of mushroom soup


Approximately equal volume of cream or milk


1-3 hamburger patties


½ – 1 onion, chopped


1-2 cups broccoli


Additional mushrooms if desired


1-3 cups of egg noodles




Process:
 Start out by frying up the hamburger patties. Add onions and fry until onions are clear. If using mushrooms, add at the end, but keep an eye on them because they burn quickly. Turn heat to low, add cream of mushroom soup, fill the empty can with milk/cream as desired, and add to pan. Simmer on low, stirring occasionally. Boil egg noodles as the sauce simmers. Broccoli may be added to noodles if desired or cooked separately. Combine as desired.


3. Texas Beef Skillet


Another family favorite, this one is especially good spicy, but spices may be excluded or added as desired for your own Southwest style.


Ingredients:




1 pound ground beef (or hamburger)


¼ cup of onion


One 16 oz can of diced tomatoes


One 15 ½ oz can of red kidney beans


½ cup rice


3 tablespoons green pepper, chopped


1 ½ teaspoons chili powder


½ teaspoon garlic powder


¾ cup shredded cheddar


Corn chips




Process: 
Cook ground beef with onions and peppers until meat is browned through. Drain off fat. Add the beans, tomatoes, rice, and water, and 
do not 
drain the fluid off the cans. Add chili powder and garlic powder and any other hot spices. Reduce heat and simmer until rice is fluffed. Serve with shredded cheddar and corn chips.

4. Potato Veggie Soup


The family recipe book strikes again. This one’s great for rainy days, making in large batches to use later in the week, and general comfort food.


Ingredients:




2-4 potatoes


1 minced yellow onion


2 cloves garlic


2 cups cream/milk


1 shallot (substitute ½ red onion if none available)


Optional, 1 large leek


¼ cup oil


Salt & pepper to taste




Process: 
Chop all vegetables. Combine all but the potatoes in one large pan and fry with oil. Remove from heat once onions are clear and vegetables seem cooked through. Boil potatoes until slightly soft. Drain most of the water away. Add the sautéed veggies and cream. If it’s too low, add water or cream until desired thickness. Add salt and pepper to taste. Simmer on low for at least an hour.
