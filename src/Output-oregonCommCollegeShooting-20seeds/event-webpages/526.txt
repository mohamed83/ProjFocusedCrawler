Yale University students are asking the school’s administration to change the name of Calhoun College, one of Yale’s 12 residential colleges, in the wake of the racially-motivated church shooting in Charleston, S.C.


The college is named after 
, a 1804 Yale graduate who later went on to become the seventh vice president of the United States. Calhoun was a strong supporter of slavery who publicly defended the institution throughout his life and called slavery a 


A group of Yale law students created an
 on June 29, 2015, according to Katherine Demby, a Yale law student and one of the drafters of the petition. The petition was circulated via email and social media. Thus far, the petition has more than 1,300 signatures from students, faculty and alumni.

“It is deeply upsetting that it has taken a tragedy such as the shooting in Charleston to initiate the removal of symbols of white supremacy from public spaces,” the petition reads. “The Confederate flag, however, is not the only symbol of white supremacy to confront. The monumental task of eliminating the vestiges of racism must include all monuments and symbols dedicated to people and institutions that fought to preserve slavery and white supremacy. We thus respectfully request that Yale University change the name of Calhoun College.”


Graham White, another Yale law student who helped create the petition, says the events in Charleston elevated a conversation about how institutions and governments recognize historical symbols of white supremacy.


“These symbols of white supremacy weren’t only being recognized in the South — we didn’t have to look very far to see that Yale had a college named after one of the most prolific white supremacists in American history,” White says. “The debate over this college has always been there, but until now there hasn’t been the momentum to make the change. So, we’re really going to try to make the change happen now.”


Matthew Goldenberg, a faculty member at the Yale Medical School and a Calhoun College alumnus, recalls the name of the college making students uncomfortable during his time there in the late ‘90s.


“I was certainly a bit bothered by it and I know I had classmates who were significantly bothered by the name,” he says.


Goldenberg believes that although there have been objections to the name of Calhoun College, it has not been changed since the college’s creation in the ‘30s as a way to engage with history.


“There’s this idea that having a name like that on a residential college helps preserve some history and has us talking about a painful racial past both in the university and the nation,” Goldenberg says. “I think there are other ways that we can engage with history other than to continue to have a building named for an ardent racist.”


Yale spokeswoman Karen Peart told the 
 that the school welcomes the discussions that have emerged.


“The tragedy in Charleston, on top of countless preceding tragedies in our country’s history, has elevated public opinion and discourse on difficult subjects that have too long been avoided,” Peart said.

Demby says she believes the university administration is open to the suggestions made in the petition. She cites the administration’s decision in the ‘90s to 
 in Calhoun College — which depicted a slave kneeling before Calhoun — after a student approached the college’s administration.


“There’s precedence for change,” Demby says.


White says it is difficult to tell what the overall consensus on campus is on the proposed name change since most students are currently away due to summer break. But he says he has mainly received support for the ideas posed in the petition. According to White, there are a few who think the change is too symbolic of an action and not substantive enough to address the larger issues.


“We recognize that this is definitely a symbolic measure, but it’s an important one because it would show that the university cares about the perspectives of minority students and hears our voices,” White says.
