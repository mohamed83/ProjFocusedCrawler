A shooter opened fire near campus housing at Texas Southern University Wednesday night, leaving two people injured. The male victim remains in critical condition and the female victim was treated and released from the hospital, 
.


An argument occurring outside TSU dorms escalated, causing the suspect to shoot a male victim in the head and another female in the leg, according to KHOU 11. A TSU police officer saw the incident unfold and shot at the suspect twice, but did not hit him.


Later identified as Darrius T. Nichols, 20, the suspect is facing charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and was taken to jail immediately, 
. Investigators were told that Nicohols and the female student were not TSU students — it is remains unclear whether the male victims are students at TSU.






My heart stopped a little bit when I heard someone was shot at TSU today.. Prayers go out to the family of the person who got shot..

Eva Pickens, associate vice president of communications at TSU, said that the university was never put on lockdown, because officials believe the shooting to be an isolated incident. According to Pickens, TSU is “secure and fully operational.”


In February of 2011, the university released a 
 that shows students and faculty what to do in the event of an active on-campus shooter.


“Most people will never be involved in an active shooter situation, but everyone needs to know what to do to protect his or her own life,” the video says.
