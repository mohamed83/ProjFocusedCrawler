College life is filled with an unending stream of serious issues, lighthearted frustrations, significant events and viral trends. The College Problems Podcast wades into this stream with a regular series of spirited chats attempting to make sense of it all, while also offering story ideas to student journalists and advice for undergrads on staying safe and sane.


The podcast is hosted by a pair of younger educators and digital media geeks who view the collegiate sphere through the lenses of journalism and personal safety.

, we addressed a pair of problems: helicopter parents who increasingly intrude into college students’ lives and date rape drugs which are making student partying and bar-hopping evermore dangerous.


Expanding upon that discussion, we tackle two new problems in our current podcast segment.


1. Professors who devote entire class sessions to movie screenings.


As University of Central Florida student Caroline Glenn 
 in the 
Central Florida Future
, “[W]
atching movies during class is a complete and utter waste of time. 
Most college students don’t have much time to spare, let alone gas to spare. So driving to campus and inevitably hunting for that elusive parking space just to get to class and find out you’ll be spending the next two hours watching a movie seems like a slap in the face — and the wallet. 
I’ll be honest. If I walk into a class and find out it’s ‘movie night,’ I walk right out because, in the infamous words of Sweet Brown, ‘ain’t nobody got time for that.'”


2. Open campuses which make it easy for outsiders to wander into academic buildings, student centers and even residence halls.
