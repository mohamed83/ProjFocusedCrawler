UNC grads provide college counseling to underserved communities

College was never a large part of the conversations at Emily Simpson’s high school in rural southwestern North Carolina.


She remembers that two counselors serving hundreds of students — meaning resources were spread thin and individual guidance was minimal.


Unlike many of her peers, however, she benefitted from having parents who had gone to college and expected that she do the same. And she did, graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May 2014.

Now, Simpson is now working as a college counselor in another rural North Carolina community much like the one where she grew up.


She does so as part of the 
, a network of 42 recent college graduates advising low-income, first-generation and underrepresented students as they navigate the college admissions process. Many of the advisors come from circumstances similar to the students they serve.


The Corps is part of a national organization — the College Advising Corps — that works with 23 university partners across the country, and has over 450 advisors serving in 500 schools. 


“I realize that big changes in terms of fostering a college-going culture take time,” Simpson says. “But all students have options, and it’s my goal to help them realize that.”


She laughs that on a day-to-day basis, she “wears a hundred hats” — reading applications, helping with SAT/ACT preparation and providing information on financial aid. She also hosts information sessions for freshmen and sophomores, emphasizing that it’s never to early for students to consider the possibility of college.


“There’s always more to do, more students to check on,” she says. “My job is my life right now, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.”


The dedication Simpson and advisers like her have shown has produced results, as college enrollment rates in the program’s partner schools are 10-11% higher than in comparison schools, according to Ashley Memory, UNC’s senior assistant director of admissions.


Memory says the Corps’ goal is to increase opportunities for students by increasing college-going rates. She notes that estimates indicate that 59% of North Carolina jobs will require college degrees by 2018.

“We recognize that when a student goes to college, it doesn’t just improve his circumstances, it also improves his family and his community,” Memory says. “Our success is linked to the prosperity of our state.”


She says students are encouraged to explore the wide range of college options — from two-year and four-year to in and out-of-state — and laughs that the advisers aren’t just recruiting for UNC.


“We’ve had students go as far as NYU. We really do want everyone to find their best fit, the place where they can most succeed,” Memory says.


The program, which is based in UNC’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions, has expanded in recent years, going from 31 advisers in 55 high schools in the 2013-2014 academic year to the current 42 advisers in 59 high schools.


And Memory says the Corps is looking to broaden its reach.


“We’re strategically looking at places where we can go next, but we’re limited by funds,” Memory says. “It’s a big goal, but we’d really love to be in every high school where students need us.”
