On August 10th, Hillary Clinton unveiled her $350 billion plan to make college more affordable. Her plan — titled the 
 — aims to help students pay to attend public universities without taking out loans for tuition.

“Is this something she’s really prioritizing? I’m not really that sure,” says Moujaes, “I think it’s a political move to separate herself from Bernie Sanders and get more young votes back.”


Brad Streicher, another student from the University of Southern California, thinks Clinton has good intentions about decreasing student loan debt, but may be going about it the wrong way.


“Rather than trying to go about the problem by raising taxes, I think a better focus might be to attack the institutional problem,” says Streicher, “College education is just way too high in general. Try to focus on lowering the price of tuition, even lowering the prices of books, where students are paying anywhere from $300 to $500 per semester.”
