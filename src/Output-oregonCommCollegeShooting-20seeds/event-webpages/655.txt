Looking for a way to add instant pizazz to your otherwise boring cubicle of a dorm? Here are 10 items that can much more than you think. Add them to your wish list, and they’ll spice up your space and get you through even the toughest days!


1. 


Don’t even think about sleeping through that 8 a.m. class with this tricky clock! The Runaway Alarm will roll around and play your favorite tunes until you catch it. It’s guaranteed to wake you up in time for class, gets you a bonus few minutes of exercise, and plays your favorite music. Need a little push from mom or dad to get you moving? You can also record a custom message for the alarm to play instead.


Where to get it: Sharper Image, $69.99


2. 


Early mornings can be killer without caffeine in some shape or form. For you latte-loving ladies, check out the Handpresso Wild, a portable gadget that lets you make yummy fresh coffee drinks wherever you might be! As an added bonus, the Handpresso is a lot cheaper than traditional espresso machines that require counter space and an electrical outlet to operate.


Where to get it: Amazon, $99.95


3. 


A huge backpack or tote bag is a terrible place for a flimsy plastic ID card. Consider investing in an ID holder with spaces for your ID and everything you need to easily locate throughout the day like keys, your cell phone, or money. Zip cases from designers like Vera Bradley come in a variety of patterns that are adorable, but super affordable too. These wristlets come in a variety of patterns and have room for all the essentials.


Where to get it: Vera Bradley, $12.00


4. Echo Smartpen Starter Kit


Even the most basic school supplies have undergone savvy techonological changes! The Echo Smartpen takes sitting in a lecture jotting down notes to a whole new level. The pen has a microphone inside that allows you to record lectures, then transfers notes and audio directly to your laptop!

Where to get it: Livescribe, $99.95
