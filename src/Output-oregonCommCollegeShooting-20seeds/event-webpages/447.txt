What comes to mind when you hear the term “field trip”? If you’re like most college students, you might cast your memory back to elementary, middle and high school excursions to exciting places like art museums, aquariums and zoos. Field trips involved learning, true, but they were also a day away from the classroom – and a fun one, at that.


But field trips in college? Aren’t you a bit too old for that? As it turns out, no! If you love to travel, going on field trips to destinations both local and exotic can be a great way to further your college education.


Check out the following four field trips for college students, as well as their academic benefits:


1. Farms


Some farms grow flowers, others cultivate crops and still others raise animals. But one thing is certain: farming – in any form – requires a great deal of work. Many farms, both domestic and international, eagerly welcome volunteers as a result. In fact, certain farms are even willing to provide you with free or subsidized room and board in exchange for your labor.


One very popular farm volunteer program is World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, better known as WWOOF. WWOOF volunteers live and work in the country of their choosing, and they receive room and board in exchange for roughly four to six hours of farm work per day. Volunteer opportunities with WWOOF (and other similar organizations) can take you virtually anywhere in the world, from a local farm in your home state to one in the rural countryside of a nation thousands of miles away.

Volunteering on a farm can provide you with more than just experience as a farmhand. Depending on the type of farm you volunteer at, you can learn more about sustainability and the environment, science, technology, math, agriculture and botany. If there are animals on the farm, you may also be able to learn about animal care.


2. Schools


Much like farms, schools often love volunteers. From tutoring a small group of students to actually 
building
 a school, you can choose from a variety of volunteer opportunities at educational facilities across the nation and abroad.


Even if you’re not interested in pursuing a teaching career, volunteering at a school can provide you with great educational benefits (in addition to helping other students). Look for volunteer opportunities in a field that interests you. For instance, if you’re passionate about a foreign language, you might decide to teach it to American students – or, conversely, teach English to students who speak that language. Though you may not wish to become a teacher, doing so is a great way to practice your foreign language and English skills.


3. Art museums


If you enjoy art, consider a local or overseas field trip to an art museum. If you choose to volunteer, you may even be able to work in a variety of roles, from greeter to docent to workshop assistant.

For an art history, fine arts, or more specialized art major, volunteer experience at an art museum can provide many educational benefits. You’ll learn about works of art and artists, as well as art movements and other aspects of art history. This can equip you with the knowledge and context you need to excel in your college art studies and professional career as an artist. Volunteering at an art museum is also a great way to find inspiration!


4. Professional conferences


Taking a field trip to a professional conference is another excellent way to further your education while also enjoying yourself. Professional conferences are offered year-round in virtually all professional fields. Look online for upcoming conferences in your major, and then narrow your search by date, location, and primary topic.


Besides learning more about a specific topic in a field that interests you, professional conferences can also help you establish valuable career connections. Be sure to bring a notebook, a pen, and several copies of your resume. Who knows – while at a conference, you may just meet your future employer!
