President Obama was visibly angry and frustrated Thursday night as he delivered a brief televised statement from the White House after the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College. Such shootings had become so routine, the president said, that “we’ve become numb to this.” His full remarks are

It was not the first time during his administration that the president has spoken out after gun violence. Here are a selection of his

A law enforcement official has identified the gunman as Chris Harper Mercer, 26, and said he had three weapons, handguns and at least one long gun. 


It was not clear whether he fired them all. Law enforcement officials said that he lived in the Roseburg area, and that one witness said he asked about people’s religions before he began firing. 


“He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,” one law enforcement official said.

Now that federal investigators have said they are 
 on 4chan to see if comments there might be linked to the gunman in Roseburg, speculation about the online message board has been spreading.

 shooter allegedly posted warning students 
?? 


— Daily Mirror (@DailyMirror) 


But messages found on 4chan have a history of being false, misleading and intentionally wrong. 


Unlike other well-known community sites like Reddit, 4chan users are not required to identify themselves, even with a user name. That makes the site a haven for the kind of people who are interested in declaring things anonymously on the Internet. 4chan message threads often disappear after a few days, granting what is said on the site a feeling of impermanence.


Generally, 4chan is a sprawling group of web forums, and much of its community is populated by users with attitudes that run counter to the mainstream. Members tend to be anti-feminist and offensive in the extreme in other ways, slurs may well be as common as greetings there, and claims of responsibility for all manner of mayhem are not uncommon.

John Hanlin, the Douglas County sheriff who appeared at two news conferences to provide updates on the victims and police investigation, was one of hundreds of sheriffs in 2013 who argued against new gun laws, 
.  


“Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” he wrote in the letter to Vice President Joseph R. Biden, dated January 15, 2013. 


He said he agreed with the sheriff of Linn County, Ore., Tim Mueller, and included a quotation from him: “In the wake of recent criminal events, politicians are attempting to exploit the deaths of innocent victims by advocating for laws that would prevent honest, law abiding Americans from possessing certain firearms and ammunition magazines. We are Americans. We must not allow, nor shall we tolerate, the actions of criminals, no matter how heinous the crimes, to prompt politicians to enact laws that will infringe upon the liberties of responsible citizens who have broken no laws.”

The shooting took place in classroom 15 in a building called Snyder, where English and writing classes are held, a student, Cassandra Welding, said.


Ms. Welding, 20, was in classroom 16 — next to the shooting — when the violence began.


She was working on a short class paper when she heard several loud bursts, like balloons popping. There were about 20 people in the classroom.  A woman seated behind her rose to shut the classroom door, she said, and was struck in the stomach by several bullets.


“He was just out there, hanging outside the door,” Ms. Welding said of the gunman, “and she slumped over, and I knew something wasn’t right. And they’re like, ‘She got shot, she got shot.’ And everyone is panicking.”


A friend of the injured woman dragged the woman into the room and began administering CPR, Ms. Welding said. Someone clicked the door shut. Someone shut off the lights, and the students huddled in the corner, blocking themselves with desks and backpacks. “I heard more shooting,” she said. “It was horrific.”


“My whole body was shaking, a chill was going down my spine. We called 911,” said Ms. Welding. “I was on the phone with my mom pretty much the entire time. I knew this could have been the last time I talked to her.”

Sheriff John Hanlin of Douglas County said that the gunman killed 10 people and wounded seven, adjusting initial reports from law enforcement officials, which counted 13 dead and 20 injured.


He said that investigators were not ready to release any information about the gunman and that the names of the victims would be released in 24 to 48 hours. 


“It is very early in this event and we are still trying to confirm a great amount of information that is floating around and great amount of information that we need to confirm,” Sheriff Hanlin said. He added: “Our victims and the families of our victims are our priority. Everything that we do from here on will be for them.”

Some of the firefighters who were at the scene of the shooting here in Roseburg have gathered at the Winchester Fire Station roughly a mile away as reporters wait for the Douglas County sheriff to hold a news conference. 


The firefighters were some of the first people on the scene. They said they had drilled for incidents like these, which helped the rapid response. Still, they were shaken. 


“You’ve heard the whole stereotype, ‘It’s not going to happen here,'” Chuck Caylor, a fire department engineer, said. “It can happen anywhere.” 


“We’re all affected by it,” he said. “It’s just sad.”

Federal law enforcement officials said they were examining a conversation on 4chan, the anonymous online message board, as well as other social media to try to determine whether any of it was linked to the gunman. 


In 
, one poster writes: “Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest.”


These kinds of threats may not be credible in any way; 4chan is a sprawling, anonymous group of web forums, and 4chan users are not required to identify themselves, even with a user name. That makes the site a haven for the kind of people who are interested in declaring things anonymously on the Internet. Also, 4chan message threads often disappear after a few days, granting what’s said on the site a feeling of impermanence.

Joe Olson, who retired as president of Umpqua Community College at the end of June, said that within the past several months the college had discussed hiring an armed security guard but ultimately decided against it.


“We talked about that over the last year because we were concerned about safety on campus,” he said. “The campus was split 50-50. We thought we were a very safe campus, and having armed security officers on campus might change the culture.”


Dr. Olson, a former deputy sheriff in Massachusetts, said there had not been a specific incident that had prompted the idea of hiring armed security, but there was a generalized fear. He said he did not believe a security guard could prevent a gunman determined to kill.


“If you want to come on the campus and you want to shoot five people, you are going to do that before our security would arrive,” he said.


Dr. Olson said the typical student on the Umpqua campus was older than the average college student, and many were taking courses in nursing, automobile mechanics and welding to learn new skills. Many had lost jobs in the timber industry, he said.

President Obama, as visibly angry and frustrated as he has ever appeared in a public setting, said that mass shootings have become so routine that “we’ve become numb to this.”


But he also sought to break through that numbness by asking news organizations to tally the number of Americans killed by terrorist attacks in the past 10 years and compare that to the number of those killed in domestic gun violence. He implicitly compared the trillions of dollars spent and multiple agencies devoted to prevent the relatively few terrorist deaths with the minimal effort and money spent to prevent the far greater tragedy of gun deaths.


And then he challenged voters to make gun safety a priority.


“If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views,” Mr. Obama said. He promised to continue hammering away at this issue for the rest of his presidency.


“And each time this happens, I’m going to bring this up,” he said. “Each time this happens, I’m going to say that we can actually do something about it.”

Rita Cavin, the interim president of Umpqua Community College, issued a brief statement Thursday. “We are still sorting through, trying to reunify students with their families,” she said. “Tomorrow the college will be closed. This weekend the college will be closed for all student activities.”


The college will reopen Monday, she said. “Right now it is a crime scene.”


Ms. Cavin said she had spent time at the fairground where those without injuries were taken. “We have families waiting for the last bus to arrive with students on it, and we have grief counselors for parents who have no children coming off that bus,” she said.

Each time this happens I’m going to bring this up. Each time this happens I am going to say we can actually do something about it. But we’re going to have to change our laws… I hope and pray I don’t have to come out again during my time as president to offer my condolences.

Presidential candidates have started extending their sympathies over the tragedy and have so far resisted using it as a reason to debate gun control.


On Twitter, Jeb Bush said that he was “Praying for Umpqua Community College, the victims, and families impacted by this senseless tragedy.”


Gov. John Kasich echoed those sentiments, writing: “The thoughts and prayers of Ohioans go out to the families & victims of the tragic shooting in Oregon today.”


Senator Bernie Sanders wrote on Twitter that his heart went out to the families of the victims.


Another senseless tragedy with more innocent people killed. Our hearts go out to the families. -B


— Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) 


And Martin O’Malley said: “My heart is with those who lost so much today in Oregon.”


Donald J. Trump, who tends to be very opinionated on social media, did not weigh in on the shooting there. But in an interview with The Washington Post, he called it a “terrible tragedy” and said it is hard to talk about something so sad. Bewildered by the increasing frequency of such events, he said, “we really have to get to the bottom of it.”

Tom Ryan, the council president of the City of Roseburg, said he was in contact with the mayor and city manager, who had gone to Umpqua Community College where the students were giving statements.


“I still don’t know how many are dead,” he said. “We are in the process of finding out. I can tell you that right now the community is in shock. It is a tragedy.”


He said most of the students at the community college live in or around Roseburg, which has a population of 22,000 inside the city limits, rising to 50,000 in the surrounding area.

So glad to be safe, but I’m still a little shell-shocked. Those of us who were on campus know less than everyone else — they weren’t telling us anything as they put us on buses and drove us offsite. BIG THANKS to local authorities who were on site within minutes.


— Amy L. Fair, of Roseburg, Ore., 
 on Thursday.
