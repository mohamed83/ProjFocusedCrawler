When you arrive to school as a freshman, the seemingly endless list of campus activities can be overwhelming. Amid the student governments, club sports and a cappella groups, it can be easy to only stick with what you know or what your friends sign up for.


But as college seniors nationwide graduate this month and universities prepare to welcome their new class of rising freshmen, it can be useful to consider what makes one campus activity — the student newspaper — so special.


Here are four reasons to work for your campus newspaper:


1. Training for the real world


In a way unlike most other campus activities, working for a campus newspaper prepares college students for journalistic careers after graduation. For students who want to go into journalism, the connection is clear: Reporting on campus gives you a body of work to show to your future employer before you’ve even had an internship or job.


For those who aren’t interested in journalism, working for your campus newspaper in any capacity still prepares you to remain calm under pressure, meet deadlines, deal with criticism of your work and take ownership of stories or projects you’ve developed.


“You learn leadership, you learn how to interact with a lot of different people — as a journalist, you have to be able to talk to people from all different backgrounds and personalities,” says Casey McDermott, former editor-in-chief for 
The Daily Collegian
 at Pennsylvania State University. “Beyond that, being a journalist gives you an opportunity to really improve your communication skills, and that’s something that can serve you well in any field.”

 if forced to choose just one, I’d say learning to adequately work on deadline is a valuable skill regardless of career path — RealTimothyWyatt (@timtacious) 


Most student newspapers function through collaboration between a team of editors, and your campus newspaper also provides experience working with your peers. You might be a senior and have a boss who is a sophomore, but juggling those dynamics will prepare you to deal with a host of complicated workplace situations — and ensure that future employers know you can do so.


2. Taking advantage of the best your campus has to offer


When you work for your campus newspaper — even if you’re not a reporter — you tend to know what’s going on around campus. By always being in-the-know, you’ll never miss the best campus events, speakers or other opportunities.


Benefits usually are doubled if you are a reporter for the paper. That speech everyone got up at 4 a.m. to wait in line for? You’ve got a press pass — and you get to interview the speaker afterwards.

3. Connections with professionals


Many successful journalists today were once student journalists, therefore creating opportunities for students to connect with professionals abound. The Society of Professional Journalists has nearly 250 chapters across the country — 145 of which are student chapters — and the groups often partner on events and other opportunities.


Additionally, reporters for student newspapers often end up covering stories alongside local reporters or even national media. At Penn State, McDermott helped lead the 
Collegian
‘s coverage of the Jerry Sandusky scandal as it escalated nationwide. On a more regular basis, she also covered local police and crime.


“As a young journalist I was covering the same things other local reporters were covering, and it was cool to be side by side with professionals and being able to experience that kind of real-world work,” McDermott says.


There are also many organizations devoted to student media that can connect students with working journalists or draw attention to their work. 
, a weekly roundup of long-form journalism, includes one story from a college journalist every week among its picks from publications like the 
New Yorker 
and 
Vanity Fair 
.


Additionally, the non-profit Student Press Law Center works to educate student journalists about their First Amendment rights and help student publications deal with challenges within and outside their universities.


4. Friendship


At most schools, no one at the college paper is getting paid. Each reporter, editor, photographer, sales representative and design assistant is there because he or she wants to be there. This commonality (plus sharing late and long hours, high-pressure situations and many learning experiences) creates some of the closest friendships of student journalists’ college careers.

Experience, laughter, learning, friendship, problem solving = working for a college paper. Cheers,
