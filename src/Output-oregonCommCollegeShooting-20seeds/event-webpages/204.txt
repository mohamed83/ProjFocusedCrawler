 Tyler Ryan Blansit, a 22-year-old biology student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, confessed to killing his mother following an argument about his grades.


Mentone Police Chief Brad Gregg told 
 that Blansit called 911 Friday afternoon. When authorities arrived, they found scratches on Tyler. His mother — 45-year-old Sherry Ann Blansit — was found dead in the backyard — the victim of blunt force trauma to the head.


According to the 
Times-Journal
, Tyler allegedly told authorities that he and his mother had been attacked in the backyard of their home. However, after an extensive investigation, Tyler  confessed to striking his mother with a baseball bat and killing her.


He was arrested and charged for murder Saturday morning.


“Usually we’ll have calls where a parent has whipped a child because of grades, a child has run away because of bad grades, but we’ve never had anything like this happen,” Sheriff Jimmy Harris told 
.


Blansit’s father, Stacey Blansit, was not at the scene. He told 
 that his son had been home for several weeks and they were waiting for his grades.


Harris is still asking the public to come forward with any information which may help investigators, despite Tyler’s confession.


“It’s just one of those things you can’t explain; we’ll never be able to explain what went through his mind, why he snapped and did this,” Harris told 


Tyler is currently being held at DeKalb County Jail. His bond has been set at $500,000.
