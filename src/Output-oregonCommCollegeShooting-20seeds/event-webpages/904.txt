Finding an apartment is a difficult task, but these resources can help make the process a little more painless.


As a freshman in college, you are usually required to live on campus with a meal plan, so you typically don’t have any worries when it comes to finding a place to live and budgeting food costs.


However, when you reach your sophomore year, you are faced with a tough decision. For many students around the country, deciding to live off-campus is a big step. Fortunately, there are many resources that allow users to research their future homes and narrow down choices before actually moving in.

• 

The housing section on Craigslist might make your parents a bit worried, but you shouldn’t completely rule out this idea. While there are many places listed on this website that are not worth it, you could find the perfect college apartment.


In order to search apartments on this website, click the links that lead you to your geographical location and then look for the “housing” section. For example, prospective residents in Columbus, Ohio, have the option to look at either apartments, real estate for sale, parking/storage and much more.


• Your university’s website

Is your college’s website very up-to-date and used often? It might offer an off-campus housing search feature. For example, Ohio State University has an off-campus housing search that students can easily find apartments from multiple agencies. This option varies depending on the college that you are attending, but it is worth searching “off campus” in your school website’s search bar before you exhaust all of your options.


• 

At College Rentals, students can search for apartments in their area while narrowing down the search criteria with factors such as whether or not the apartment allows pets, whether the apartment is furnished, the price of the apartment and the apartment’s distance from campus. They also offer a blog so when you eventually do find the perfect apartment, you can find tips and tricks for off-campus living.


• 

Rent.com has a simple search option and offers many choices regarding apartments with different locations available. The only downside is that the search only allows you to locate apartments in a city, not around a college. While this may not make a difference in smaller places, residents in places such as Columbus may have trouble finding an apartment to fit their needs.


• 

On the housing section of Uloop, students can easily search apartments listed in their university’s area. Uloop offers a search bar so students can choose from over 1,500 college towns. Uloop is a great option because it works closely with students from many different colleges and the staff is helpful and friendly.


Deciding on an apartment can be both stressful and tedious, but the Internet can help this process move more painlessly. There are many factors that can affect a person’s decision, but with many options, it should be easy to find the perfect place to call your future home.
