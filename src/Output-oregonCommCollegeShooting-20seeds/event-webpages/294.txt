When it comes to getting involved on campus, commuter students have an extra challenge: proximity.


It isn’t nearly as easy for commuter students to 
 as it is for someone who lives on campus in dorms or apartments. Those students can walk three minutes to a meeting, go to last-minute poster-making sessions and comfortably involve themselves in four different activities that meet at random times of the day because they literally live in the epicenter of student involvement.


Commuter students, do not feel hopeless — here are four ways you can remain involved on campus without being held back by your off-campus status.


Take on telecommuter/remote roles


Is the student union assembly planning an event that requires volunteers to make flyers? What about publicity on social media? These online tasks are easily done no matter where you are, so commuter students should snap up any opportunity to become involved on campus doing remote work. This is an easy way to stay connected and easily contribute to an organization that needs extra work done on the web.


TRENDING: 


Ask some groups with which you’d like to work if they have any vacant roles that are compatible with your commuter lifestyle. Maybe a fundraiser planning committee ordered a bunch of doughnuts at one store and flowers at another store that happen to be located between your house and your campus — you could easily pick them up and be reimbursed for the gas, without doing too much extra driving!


There are roles out there for commuter students if you search hard enough.


Find an activity that meets before or after your classes


Got a class from 12 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays? See if there’s a organization or club that regularly meets at 11 a.m. or 2 p.m. on these days. As a commuter student, you are probably used to trying to group up everything you need to do on campus in a single time block to avoid making five trips to campus each day.


Conversely, if you have some level of flexibility with class scheduling, try to take classes that meet before or after an activity you are really interested in doing on campus. This is not only an incentive to get you to stick with the activity, but it’s something to look forward to before or after class.


Make a habit of staying on campus most of your school days


If you’re the type that likes to get everything done in one place, you might benefit from getting to campus in the morning and leaving in the evening. This way, you’re on campus most of the day, and it’s almost as though you actually do live on campus.


You’ll feel more tied to the community, and you will have many more options open to you as far as involvement opportunities. Plus, it’s much harder to be late for classes and activities when you’re already on campus (say goodbye to the traffic jam excuse!)


WATCH: 


In off-times when nothing is going on, you’ll have libraries nearby in which to complete schoolwork (which kind of forces you to be productive!).


When you leave for home in the evening, you’ll feel satisfied and proud of all you got done on campus each day–both academically and socially. And hopefully, if you were able to complete all your studying on campus, you’ll be able to unwind at home with a huge bowl of popcorn, 
America’s Got Talent
 auditions on your DVR, and a fuzzy cat on your lap (take that, on-campus students! Commuter students have pets as roommates).


Another perk of being a commuter student? No mandatory pants-wearing in your downtime. Who needs those, anyway?


Challenge yourself


Since the commuter lifestyle is so different from on-campus living, you’ll have to put more effort into making and keeping close friends. 
 as often as you can, and talk to students in your classes, club meetings, nighttime events, and anywhere you can — even at the little food mart you stop at twice a day for emergency chocolate bars.


Friends will not be around you 24/7 like they would be in a residence hall on campus, so it’s up to you to create a support circle elsewhere. You might even meet other commuter students like yourself, and if they happen to live close to you and are involved in the same activities you are, you’ll be much more excited to go to organization meetings with a friend who understands 
.


Yes, college looks a lot different for a commuter student than the traditional college experience — but being a commuter student is 
.


Factoring commute times into your schedule is an added task to your coursework and extracurriculars, but you will learn to strategize quickly. Your level of involvement on campus is proportional to your motivation and effort to attend meetings and events — more power rests with you to soak up as much of the college essence as you can, so find out what you like to do, and make time to do it!


Stay strong, commuter student. This lifestyle will look pretty snazzy financially, and that’ll hopefully be worth the extra hassle of leaving your house and getting onto campus for all the cool activities you’ve come to love.
