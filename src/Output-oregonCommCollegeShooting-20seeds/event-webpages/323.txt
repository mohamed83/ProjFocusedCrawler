(By Rachel Sederberg)


Unless you are extremely lucky, being on a college budget means that you have to be thrifty when making purchases. You can watch for sales, explore couponing, just wait to ask for certain items for Christmas, or you can use the little plastic card that buys your meals at school to get some great discounts!


Your student ID can be a very powerful tool when it comes to retail shopping. Think about all of the things you have bought in college. Was one of them a computer? How about clothes? Have you gone to see a movie lately? All of these things, and many more, become more affordable by simply presenting your student ID when you get to the register.


Apple is a company bursting into the lives of college students everywhere through its numerous electronic devices. When you go to buy a computer – and some other items as well – Apple will take money off the bill if you just 
. They even make it so that you can shop with your student discount right on their website; all you have to do is find your school in their database. Other computer retailers, such as Dell, offer similar discounts and promotions to students.


Clothing retailers really want you, as a college student, to wear their clothes and advertise their brand around your campus. To get you to do this, many retailers such as Vineyard Vines and J.Crew will offer a discount to you in any of their retail stores for presenting your student ID at checkout. Some outlet stores will do this as well. J.Crew, for example, offers the discount at both their regular and outlet locations. Other retailers who offer discounts include Eastern Mountain Sports, Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, and Rugby Ralph Lauren.


Amazon also offers a student promotion. You can sign up for their 
 program with your .edu email address and get Amazon Prime free for six months. This means you will always have free shipping, no matter what the order. This perk is especially useful if you want to use Amazon to buy bigger things for your dorm room or apartment, which would ordinarily cost exorbitant amounts to ship.


You can even use your student ID to help defray the costs of owning a car. General Motors is offering a 
 who are in college or recently graduated when they buy a GM car. If you already have a car, and you are paying for your car insurance, you can use a college discount to help with that as well. Many insurance companies will offer a good student discount, where all you have to do is prove that you are in good standing with your college or university. You can usually do this by having your school send over a transcript to the company.


College discounts aren’t just be for material goods and you can use your college ID to help bring down the cost of entertainment as well. If you are in New York City, you can go to a Broadway box office and see if they have Student Rush tickets available for a given show. Often this will cut the cost significantly, and make a Broadway show quite affordable.


You can also try your local movie theater to see if they offer a student discount. Often times, the bigger chain cinemas will have a program to save you a couple dollars when you go see a movie. Museums will typically cut you a break as well. You can often find reduced admission to museums, and you can also check to see if your school has a membership with them, as this can allow you to even get in for free. If you are somewhere that has snow in the winter, even ski resorts will have discounted lift tickets for students.


Being a college student doesn’t have to mean that you can’t afford to buy or do nice things. It simply means that you need to shop smart. Always ask if there is a student rate available, the worst that can happen is they say no.


Go out and see what is offered in your area, it may surprise you how much you can save. Keep asking around, and always have that ID with you, you never know when it may come in handy!
