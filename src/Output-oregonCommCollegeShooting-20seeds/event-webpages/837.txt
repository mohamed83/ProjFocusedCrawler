Ridwan Hassen knows the power of hard work.


The son of African refugees, Rhodes Scholar Hassen is a first-generation college student. Both of his parents lived through war –  his father in Ethiopia,  his mother in Somalia . During these times, children were often not allowed to attend school.


“My dad was denied an education,” Hassen says. “They always say education is the most important thing.”


Determined to make his parents proud and set an example for his younger siblings, Hassen strived for excellence. He developed a passion for science and a desire to help others.


“I wanted to be a role model for my siblings and show them that they too can do well despite the circumstances,” says Hassen, a senior at Dartmouth College.


Hassen says he also wants to emphasize the importance of embracing new experiences. He studied for two years at Emory University before transferring to Dartmouth. And while he originally majored in computer science modified with neuroscience, he plans to study public policy at Oxford.


“If I did science at Oxford I’d be in the lab again and get the same experience,” Hassen says. “Studying policy is a way to challenge myself in a new environment.”


This mindset has served him well in the classroom. Dartmouth professor Maral Yessayan says Hassen always went above and beyond to challenge himself on assignments.


“Ridwan made his mark as a leader in the classroom from the very first day,” Yessayan says, recounting Hassen’s eagerness to help set up the class Facebook account and initiative in volunteering to be the first to present a project to the class. “He was always ready to venture into unknown territories.”


Hassen put those qualities to use through the 
 a charity he founded in 2013 to help bolster economies of developing nations. He noticed that some organizations don’t always enable the people of the countries they help, but instead only focus on building economies.


“We believe influential capital already exists in these developing communities, and we want to tap into that and help them build their own infrastructure,” Hassen says.


GDP also strives to instill a sense of empowerment in the countries’ youth.


“Children can see that they too can repair and build society,” Hassen says. “It empowers kids and future generations.”


Hassen also works to empower the youth in his own community. He has served as a chemistry mentor, refugee tutor, youth counselor for the Boys & Girls Club and regularly visits his high school, South Cobb High in Austell, Ga., to speak with students.


“He’s always trying to help people,” says Victor Burrell, a statistics teacher at South Cobb and longtime mentor to Hassen.


Despite his array of accomplishments,  Burrell says Hassen stays humble.


“He’s been the same person—humble, hardworking, nice, respectful,” says Burrell, who has known Hassen for almost eight years. “He’s been like this since the day I met him.”


Hassen credits mentors like Burrell and his family for motivating him to pursue  the Rhodes Scholarship. He heard about it from his sister, who, along with family, friends and mentors, persuaded him to apply despite his own doubts.


“I’m glad I did it because the end result was something I couldn’t picture,” he says.


Next stop, Oxford. After that, Hassen sees possibilities in several areas, but his ultimate goal remains the same.


“All I know is I want to continue what I’m doing, working with GDP and influencing my community,” Hassen says. “If that takes me into policy or being a scientist I’m not sure, but Oxford will help me figure out what my true calling is.”
