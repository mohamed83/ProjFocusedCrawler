PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — At least 10 people were killed and 7 others injured in a shooting at Umpqua Community College, Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said Thursday night.


Multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation identified the gunman as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer according to WCVB via CNN. 


President Barack Obama spoke during the aftermath of the shooting, saying that the US is becoming numb to mass shootings and that perpetrators have sickness in their minds.


Kortney Moore, a student at Umpqua Community College, said the gunman shot her teacher and asked others in her classroom about their religion before spraying more bullets.


Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said there was one male shooter and that when officers arrived on scene he fired at them and they engaged in gunfire. He was then neutralized. It is unknown if he is a student.




The first call about the shooting came into the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office at 10:37 a.m.


Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin says authorities responded and exchanged gunfire with the man. He says the shooter died at the scene, but he didn’t say whether the man killed himself or was shot by police.


During a press conference following the incident, Governor Kate Brown said the shooter was a 20-year-old man. She said she was leaving to go to Roseburg to be briefed on the situation.


It is unknown if the gunman was a student at the school. CNN reports 3 pistols and one long-rifle were recovered at the scene.


A student at the college says the gunman shot her teacher and asked others in her classroom about their religion before spraying more bullets.


Eighteen-year-old Kortney Moore of Rogue River tells the Roseburg News-Review newspaper that she was in a writing class at Umpqua Community College when a shot came through a window.


The gunman entered her classroom and told people to get on the ground.


Moore says the man started asking people to stand up and state their religion and then opened fire.

The Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg said they had received 9 patients from the shooting.


PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at Riverbend in Eugene confirmed they received 3 patients via Life Flight medical helicopter. Two of the patients were females. All three had gunshot wounds.


The campus was on lock down after the reports came in. The shooting reportedly started in Snyder Hall.


Senator Jeff Kruse spoke to KOIN 6 about the shooting, saying many facts are unconfirmed and that he had gotten conflicting reports about the shooter’s identity. He said one of the main issues officials faced was that the campus is very rural and the buildings have great distances between each other, so clearing out the buildings was difficult.


He praised the work of the first responders.


Former Umpqua Community College president Joe Olson, who retired in June, says the school has only one security officer on duty at a time, and that person isn’t armed.


Counselors are available at the Douglas County Fair Grounds where students are gathering. About 3,000 students attend the college, where classes began earlier this week after a summer break.


President Barack Obama has been briefed on the situation. At his request, he’ll continue to receive updates throughout the day.


KOIN 6 will have more information when it becomes available.
