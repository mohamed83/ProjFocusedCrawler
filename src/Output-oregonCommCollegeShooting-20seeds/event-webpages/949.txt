Dig deeper into College Factual’s men’s lacrosse rankings with this interactive tool










































Lacrosse is one of the oldest team sports in North America. When originally played by Native Americans, the game was major holiday that could last several days with players competing from dawn to dusk. Goals could be up to six miles apart with hundreds of players involved. Medicine men would perform rituals to bless the teams.


European explorers grew to love the game and by the mid-1800s it was Canada’s national sport and eventually the size of the field, length of game and other rules were standardized. An indoor version of the game was developed in the 1930s. Both indoor and outdoor lacrosse have professional leagues, although the pay is not career quality.


Lacrosse is a popular and exhilarating college sport than can give you a chance to go to a great school.


College Factual’s 
 takes into account the athletic success of the team, as well as the quality of the school and the academic progress of the student-athletes.
