As I reflect on my undergraduate years at the University of Pennsylvania, I often remember my years as a student government representative.


There were some great times where we completed meaningful projects. But if I can now be honest, it was poorly-executed production of 
House of Cards
.


RELATED: 


Egos ran amuck, and ambition was misdirected with insecurity. Eventually, I would respectfully resign by my junior year to chase my real dreams. If only more students understood why they should really consider running for student government as opposed to seeking a resume and confidence booster, perhaps real issues affecting student life would be addressed.


So here are four real reason why you should consider running for student government.


Run for issues directly affecting campus, not your own political agenda.


Often we can get caught up in the national news issues that we forget about the current ones directly affecting student life. Sure, endangered wildlife is a worthy cause, but that’s not why the students on your campus elected you. Use your position to fight for their concerns, not just your personal ones. Democracy wouldn’t work if we all wanted to have things our way, all day long.


Run for positions in which you can actually make meaningful, tangible change


It’s frustrating to watch the same people run up the power ladder every year during campus elections. The vice-president becomes the president, his or her board secretary attempts to replace the vice president — and the cycle continues.


Stop the madness.


Don’t using one leadership position solely to climb to another that, in your eyes, is better. Too many students on campus have the passion and rigor to be a great parliamentarian or vice president rather than you just hold on it to wait for the next big move. Be fair and pass it on to someone more invested than you.


Run as a student, not as a politician


This is not the 2016 president election. You are just simply filling a campus position, one that will be filled with another student after you and so on.


At the end of the day, the fate of the world doesn’t fall in your hands. So don’t feel like it does. You will still get into law school, land a decent job and be successful if you don’t win.


So please, for the love of your peers voting, stop spamming their inboxes and harassing them on campus. They are your friends, not a target demographic. Treat them with kindness and reach out in a sincere way as opposed to running a mock campaign filled with propaganda and promises you’ll never keep even if you wanted to.


Run with genuine intentions, not with catchy slogans or stunts


If I see another cheesy rap video aimed at trying to get college students to vote for them, I will call YouTube personally and ask them to remove the video.


Seriously, student campaigns have gone from wearing full three-piece suits to birthday suits. When you rely on corny appeals and visuals to get students to vote for you, your lack of seriousness distracts them from your merits that make you worthy of the position.


And to say that students are relying on “stunts” is an understatement.


Find a reason why you really care enough to run for student government. Get people to focus on that – not your awful singing abilities or over-the-top campaign posters. No one is saying you can’t have fun, but don’t mock the ability to make a difference on campus in the process.


Overall, let these four reasons stick with you for the next student government election on your campus. Be more, expect more, and do more for the next year of campus life! And yes, you may borrow my now corny campaign slogan.
