In this day and age, where technology changes at lighting speed, young developers and entrepreneurs seem to be everywhere.


According to a 
 done by U.S. Department of Labor, the employment of computer and information research scientists is likely to increase by 15% by 2022.


Students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) have discovered their own means for practical experience outside of the classroom in the form on an they created app based on their experiences in college.


Krishna Mittal, a freshman at UIUC, is currently developing an app called Shaked, which enables users to exchange contact information in a simpler, more convenient way. Mittal was inspired to create the app after repeatedly finding  networking with others to be cumbersome.


Neil Nijhawan, a junior at UIUC, co-founded an app called Shortnotice, which uses face-to-face reactions as a driver for making plans.

Aisha Davis, technical account manager at Microsoft, says her computer science journey started in high school when she attended 
, a Microsoft YouthSpark program designed to assist high school girls who are interested in the field. Davis says she was able to learn HTML and incorporate the WeatherBug app on a website she created. Not only did she learn technological skills, but she also met her mentor, Lindsay Lindstrom, who has continually helped her.


When she attended college at Johnson C. Smith University in North Carolina, Davis she took part in 
, a global competition for young technologists held by Microsoft. She  developed a mobile weight loss application and made it to the first round.


Davis says she mentors classmates at her university just like Lindstrom mentored her.


Reflecting on her many experiences, Davis says her involvement in application development was merely one of several factors that helped her obtain a job at Microsoft — and that her passion for computer science really helped pave the path to her success.


“I wasn’t a 4.0 student, I just had a dream, I had a passion and I had a mentor,” Davis says. “People say dreams don’t come true. Microsoft was my dream company and I was your average Joe and I’m here now and I’m living my dream everyday.”


When recruiting individuals to work for Microsoft, Mike Scott, Senior Program Manager of Microsoft Academy of College Hires, says that the evaluation process consists of looking at the person as a whole, which includes their college degree, passion for technology, involvement in internships, engagement outside of the classroom and the obstacles they overcame.


Although app development can add value to an applicant’s resume and differentiate you from other individuals, Scott says they really look for the underlying competencies associated when creating the app, which include innovation, problem solving, customer focus, efficiency of code and passion for technology.


“We look for individuals who are committed to being lifetime learners and agile enough to look for new ways of doing things and keeping up with the changes in the industry,” says Scott.


Additionally, Scott says networking, finding internships, joining organizations, utilizing your career center and working on projects on the side are several ways students can get a leg up in their career to get noticed by large corporations like Microsoft.


While most students may have gone the typical route of schooling, there are the occasional students who take a more unorthodox path. Some of the most famous developers and entrepreneurs in the computer industry —  Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates among them — dropped out of school to work on their ideas.


Ari Weinstein, creator of Workflow and DeskConnect, dropped out of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) his freshman year to take part in the 
, which 20 fellows are granted $100,000 focus more on their work and research.


During his time at MIT, Weinstein says he was very conflicted because although he learned a lot from his classes, he was spending a lot of time working on his apps. He says he loves the idea of creating an app that helps people get things done more efficiently and so the fellowship granted him the opportunity to further develop his software and start his own company.


In January 2014, Weinstein attended a Hackathon event at the University of Michigan and won first place for his idea of the 
 app, which serves as a personal automation tool that gives users the option to create their own workflows and apps. The app was launched in December.






We're thrilled and honored to be chosen as Editors' Choice this week by the 
 team!

“Certainly in my experience…the skillsets are more important than the degree. I was lucky enough to be offered jobs having never gone to college or only done a year in college,” Weinstein says. “I believe that companies do take college student developers seriously.”
