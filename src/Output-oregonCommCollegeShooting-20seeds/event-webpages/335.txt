 shows that 1 in 5 college students abuses prescription stimulants, such as Adderall, Ritalin and Vyvanse, once in their lifetime.


The survey, released to young adults between the ages of 18 to 25 around the country, showed that half of the participants reported using  stimulants to improve academic or work performance.


Of the 1,621 participants, 60% reported abusing Adderall with Ritalin and Vyvanse following closely behind.


“When they feel everyone is doing it, I think they can underestimate some of the dangers,” says Josh Hersh, staff psychiatrist at Miami University.


According to the 
 taking medications when not properly prescribed can lead to addiction and risks of overdose.


“Universities nationwide face the public health problem of stimulant misuse and I think that universities nationwide are trying, in association with different groups, to target this public health problem of stimulant misuse on campuses,” Hersh says.


To remedy the issue, Miami University hosts numerous outreach and educational campaigns, as well as offers students a 
 to provide information to students who are concerned about a friend, according to Hersh.


Despite the gradual increase of prescription stimulant abuse among students over the years, the numbers are beginning to stabilize, according to Sean Clarkin, director of programs for the Partnership for Drug- Free Kids.


“It’s very much a socially-driven behavior. People are getting Adderall and other stimulants from their friends,” Clarkin said.


According to the survey, 56% of students said that the prescription stimulants are easily obtained through social networks where students can connect with friends that have the drug.


Virginia Tech student Julia Cockrill has witnessed this firsthand as someone who has been prescribed the drug.


“I’ve heard a lot more people talking about it. If they know I have it, they’ll try to buy it from me,” Cockrill says.


Cockrill does not sell the drug, but is instead bothered by the comments.


“They’re not really realizing what it’s for, it’s actually an illness. It makes me upset that that’s what it’s become,” Cockrill says.


Virginia Tech student Lilly O’Dea also takes Adderall and has similar feelings.


“Since I’ve gotten my prescription, I’ve seen people actively seek out people to get it from… As a whole, I think all of us are overworked and some people will take it as leg up. People that actually have prescriptions don’t use it and abuse it like that,” O’Dea says.


While neither Cockrill nor O’Dea sell or share the drug, 28% of those who have been legally prescribed the stimulants reported sharing the drug with friends.


The availability of the stimulants is one of many factors facilitating the use of the drug among students, according to Hersh.


“There’s an increased availability of substances with any public health problem. As you have an increased availability, you’ll see more people struggle with this problem,” Hersh says.


During a panel discussion held at New York University over the weekend, Hersh suggested addressing time management skills.


“Other studies suggest that one of the most common reasons students are abusing stimulants is cramming and deadline-oriented studying. That’s where I do believe time management strategies can help prevent this public health problem,” Hersh says.


His suggestion is an important one as universities try to prevent dependency on the drug.


“When medicines get woven into everyday life, in terms of managing life, it’ll be harder to grow out of it,” Clarkin says.
