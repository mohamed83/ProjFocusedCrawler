Your phone is filled with distractions. It can be used for e-mails, taking notes, scheduling group projects and more. But it could also make you safer on a college campus.


Or at least that’s the premise behind the a newly-formed partnership between Marquette University and BlueLight, an app hoping to take over campuses nationwide. The premise of BlueLight is simple: Since students are attached to their phones, there should be an app to contact them with emergency contacts and first responders when needed.


BlueLight has two main functions, both of which revolve around smart phones’ GPS capabilities.


It can call and send your location to campus public safety or 911 with the tap of a button, using your location to contact the appropriate resource and let them know exactly where to find you. If you are on campus, your call automatically gets routed to campus public safety or the campus police. But when you go off campus, BlueLight directs your call to 911.

BlueLight’s other function is called On My Way, which enables you to alert friends of your travels and arrival in real time, so they can make sure you safely reach your destination. This feature is especially useful when walking home at night, as it allows others to track your progress.


While BlueLight isn’t the only safety-related app on the market, it courts college students as its target demographic with its simple pitch.


“When researching apps and their usage on college campuses, very few universities were deploying applications as safety measures,” said Karlie Ruane, a senior at Marquette who researched what other schools are doing to improve campus safety.

The idea to bring BlueLight to Marquette stemmed from a focus group in late September, where students shared their safety-related ideas with administrators. Adam Pulte, a Marquette senior, was part of the focus group and the first to propose the idea of an app to connect the Department of Public Safety with students.


“This (focus group) comforted me as a student and made me realize that the concerns we had as students were being heard and taken with the utmost sincerity,” Pulte said.


Pulte realized that students could be active participants in campus safety by giving students, via their cell phones, quick access to the DPS. Following the focus group, Tim Cigelske, director of social media at Marquette University, reached out to Preet Anand, the CEO and founder of BlueLight.


Tim soon had a demo phone with a test version of BlueLight for himself and select Marquette students to try out, which later expanded to include a pilot group of students and staff members that tested a not-yet-released version. Marquette spent the fall semester testing BlueLight and working to ensure that it would be well-received by the community, which included multiple trips to the Milwaukee campus by Anand.


The latest edition of the app is currently available to both iPhone or Android users. Along with its growing number of student users, BlueLight is also gaining the support of authorities.


“I’ve been in law enforcement and protective services for over 22 years and I can say unequivocally, BlueLight will save someone’s life,” wrote one Android user of the app in a review.


BlueLight places safety into the hands of students. It works intuitively with campuses to ensure that students feel secure in any location.
