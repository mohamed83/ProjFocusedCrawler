SACRAMENTO, Calif.  — Police say three people have been shot and one of them has died in a parking lot next to a baseball field on the campus of Sacramento City College.


Police say the campus is on lockdown Thursday night while they search for a suspect with no shirt wearing cargo shorts.


Sacramento police say the three victims were all men. One has been confirmed dead, and the other two are being taken to hospitals.


Classrooms and offices are on lockdown while police create a perimeter.


The parking lot is at the edge of campus, and it wasn’t immediately clear whether the gunman or the victims have any connection to the college.


Classes were in session at the college with a student body of about 25,000. The fall semester began Aug. 22.
