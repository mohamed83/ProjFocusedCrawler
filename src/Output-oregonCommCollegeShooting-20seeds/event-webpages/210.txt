The University of Georgia (UGA) community was left shocked and confused Friday morning as word spread of the 
 of 21-year-old student and resident assistant Mikal Ghirmazghi, who was found unconscious in her dorm room Thursday night.


University police said in a statement that they were called to 
 — a freshman dorm of nearly 1,000 students — at around 6 p.m. Thursday for medical assistance. Both officers and EMS began first aid efforts when they arrived on the scene, but the coroner later 
 Ghirmazghi was dead upon arrival.

According to 
, Athens-Clarke County Coroner Sonny Wilson said an autopsy is scheduled for Saturday morning, after which the incident will most likely be ruled a “medical death” due to a possible preexisting medical condition.


As police could not discern any clear cause of death or evidence of foul play upon preliminary investigation, UGA students and staff alike were taken aback and saddened by Ghirmazghi’s death, which police first alerted the public to in an 8:25 p.m. e-mail.

“When I opened [the police statement], I saw the name and I was like ‘No, this can’t be,’” says James Oloya, an assistant professor who taught Ghirmazghi in an epidemiology class last semester. “She was very close to me. I got to know her in the class. There are just special students who always pass by and spend some time with you. She was more like a friend, though I didn’t know her that much.”


Oloya says although his class had more than 100 students in it, he still remembers Ghirmazghi for the “strong connection” she had with both him and her classmates.


“There was something about her,” he says. “She was just generally warm — you could see from her face, she just lightens up when she sees you.”


Outside of her classes, Ghirmazghi — a Decatur, Ga., native who was 
 to her friends as “Miki” — was involved in the Caribbean Student Association with Amanda Watson, a senior majoring in Romance languages.


“She was always ready to help, volunteer and support everyone with what they were trying to accomplish,” she says. “We weren’t super close but that was the beautiful thing about her — she touched everyone she came into contact with. She just was there to offer a smile and lend a hand whenever needed.”






Miki, you were more than just our RA, you were our friend. We love and miss you so much, thanks for everything ❤️ rest in peace 👼

Matt Simpson, a RA in Creswell Hall and a junior majoring in civil engineering, says he didn’t know Ghirmazghi personally, but that it still came as a shock to hear about a coworker who abruptly died so close to where he lives.


“It’s hard to hear any student being lost from the campus. It’s another to have it hit a little closer to home,” he says. “It’s right across the street from where I am, so it was a little hard to settle in once I saw the news trucks outside and everything.”

Marisa ValeCruz, a freshman and resident in Russell Hall, was walking to dinner Thursday night when she saw police cars and a coroner’s truck parked outside her dorm. She later learned about Ghirmazghi’s death on the anonymous social media app Yik Yak.


“I had seen some stuff like that before, but never that many emergency responders,” she says. “As soon as it happened, Yik Yak was blowing up about it.”


And not all of it was informatory.


According to the 
 of UGA student Tifara Brown, a racist Yik Yak post condemning minority students was created Thursday at around 2 a.m., after Ghirmazghi’s death.

“Most of the dead students were minorities. Good riddance. You don’t belong at UGA, even God agrees,” the post reads.


The post was quickly downvoted on Yik Yak, but Brown and others will address the act of racism — as well as honor the memory of Ghirmazghi — Friday night during an 
 addressing diversity and inclusivity on UGA’s campus.


Ghirmazghi, who would have 
d this semester, is the 
 UGA student to die in 2015. Kelsey Fayer, a freshman and a representative on the Russell Community Council, says while some of the other incidents were 
-related, Ghirmazghi’s death seems more mysterious.


“This one just kind of seemed very random. She wasn’t — as far as we know — in (a place) that you would necessarily consider dangerous,” she says. “We just normally associate where you sleep as somewhere that you’re safe. You don’t really necessarily associate that with some place that you could die.”


Moving forward, Fayer says there are two things the UGA community must do — honor Ghirmazghi’s life and grow closer as a student body.


“There have been multiple student deaths this semester and it’s drawn us closer together,” she says. “There’s been a larger sense of community and support and just coming to the realization that life is short.
