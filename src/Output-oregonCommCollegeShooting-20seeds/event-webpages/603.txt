Mother’s Day is this Sunday — May 10
th
 — and if you haven’t already planned accordingly for how to spend the day, maybe the ideas below will help! With final exams and preparing for the summer, some of us college students may forget the value our moms have in our lives.


College students from various universities across the nation were surveyed via an informal survey on social media — created by USA TODAY collegiate correspondent Casey Budd — on how they will appreciate Mom on this special day.


Whether miles apart or back at home, students plan to do everything from giving her a call to surprising mom with her favorite chocolate. However, most students felt the best gift to give is simply spending quality time together.
