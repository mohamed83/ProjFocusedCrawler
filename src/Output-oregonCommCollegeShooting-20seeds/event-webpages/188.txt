Mintz was celebrating his son's sixth birthday on Thursday. He posted on Facebook about it just hours before the shooting.

His aunt, Wanda Mintz, 
that Chris Mintz had talked to his father in North Carolina as he was walking into class. 

"My brother talked to Chris on the phone while Chris was walking into school to tell him to remind his grandson that grandpa said, ‘Happy Birthday,’" Wanda Mintz told the news station.
