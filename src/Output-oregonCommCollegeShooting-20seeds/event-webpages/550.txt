When Adan Gonzalez first arrived at Georgetown University, he had $10 in his pocket. His clothes were in trash bags.


He’s now the founder and CEO of his own non-profit organization and trying to decide which law school to attend.


But to understand Gonzalez and his story, you’d have to know Oak Cliff, Texas. Gonzalez describes it as “the heart of Dallas,” “the ‘hood” and “a neighborhood of low expectations and limited resources.” To complete his college applications for example, he remembers turning to public Wi-Fi and a school computer.


Leaving Oak Cliff for Georgetown University marked the start of Gonzalez’ journey of leading a double life, he says.


“I was living a dream [at Georgetown],” he says. “But beyond that, it was two different worlds: One of a lot of awesome opportunities, and then there’s the real world at home where there are people who are just working really hard to survive.”


As a Georgetown student, Gonzalez says he got the opportunity to meet President Obama and even interned at the White House.


Then he would go back to a home no electricity.


At times, the stark differences between his two lives left Gonzalez feeling torn between his home life and school life.


“Going to a school that is made up of elite students, it was tough… I brought in a different perspective and a different lifestyle,” Gonzalez says. “That was difficult because you entered a room and you feel invisible because you don’t feel like you can relate.”

Gonzalez also juggled a heavy load outside of his schoolwork — working two to three jobs, volunteering to maintain his scholarship eligibility and competing 
.


That’s not to say Gonzalez’s fights were limited to the ring. His Oak Cliff upbringing taught him to not only fight for his dreams, but for the dreams of others.


“I always describe myself as a fighter,” he says. “I always understood that I had to fight for what I love and what I need to survive because that’s the only way of life that I understood before my higher education.”


And Gonzalez says he now understands the importance of entering a fight with a strategy.


Higher education, he says, “helps organize what you already know,” which is why it’s so important to him that his community receives equal access to education.


“My community is so talented and skilled,” he says. “If they’re able to organize their talent, it’s amazing what we’ll be able to contribute not only to this country but to those kids back home in Oak Cliff.”


Through his work with his empowerment group, the Si Se Puede (“Yes We Can”) Network, Gonzalez is trying to make sure that happens.


Since the organization’s launch three years ago, Gonzalez says the Si Se Puede Network has engaged with more than 100,000 parents and students. In addition to encouraging kids to believe in their aspirations and create a plan to execute them, the Si Se Puede Network also provides them with mentors, community service opportunities and events like the 
, which Gonzalez says provided 200 students with luggage sets just last month.


“What I’ve done doesn’t make me different from the kids around me,” Gonzalez says. “They have the same dreams to aspire to great things but don’t even know where to begin.”


The network’s most recent initiative is its Athletic Academy, which has a boxing and soccer program for kids age five to 13.

“Right now, 35 kids show up to my backyard for boxing lessons,” says Gonzalez, whose professional boxing debut is next year.








































But instead of just giving boxing lessons, Gonzalez is implementing an academic curriculum to accompany the program.


“I don’t charge them a dime,” he says. “But their ticket to come in the backyard is an assignment that I give each of the kids.”


Gonzalez says his motivation for helping students stems from the love and appreciation he has for his mom and dad.


He describes his parents — who are both immigrants from Mexico — as his “heroes,” saying, “Everything I do is a reflection of their hard work and sacrifice. They’ve done everything for my family.”


Their selfless nature inspired Gonzalez to look for ways to pay it forward.


“All these opportunities are great for me, but how am I going to replicate these for everyone else who are still struggling at home?” he says. “I’m a Mexican-American kid from the ‘hood with one dream: to finish my parents’ American dream. But now I want to help the same kids who look like me who feel like they’re not valued.”


His work is also necessary, he explains, due to the dearth of people helping his community and the questionable intentions of the few that do.


“It’s very limited to see people who are doing good for others and not just for themselves and it’s time for us to change that,” he says. “There’s a lot of non-profits all over the place who are just interested in being relevant, and in my opinion, the most relevant you are is when you help the most people.”

So, what’s next for Gonzalez’s double life?


After deferring for a year due to personal issues, Gonzalez is now deciding on graduate and law schools with the dream of one day earning a PhD in leadership and education and working as an immigration lawyer.


As for the Si Se Puede Network, his dream is to serve all 186,000 students in Dallas by hosting a network center with resources and engagement opportunities in every school.


“I think if we’re able to teach our community to be civically engaged, they’re going to love who they are, they’re going to love where they’re from,” he says. “And once you create a pride in their roots, there’s not going to be anyone who can tell them they don’t have value, that they’re not important. And to me, that is key for the progression of our community, and that’s what the Puede Network is going to strive to do.”
