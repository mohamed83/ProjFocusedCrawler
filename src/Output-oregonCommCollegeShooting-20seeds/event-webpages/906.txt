At Western Michigan University, it’s all about the pizza.


Have a love for quirkiness? Not into joining your run-of-the-mill school paper or homecoming committee?


There are plenty of 
 and our pals at Her Campus have surfaced a few you might not know about — from a murder mystery club to a pizza-crust-appreciation club, check out these wacky options.


Western Washington University – 


Murder mysteries are no longer just for the detectives in books and movies — now you can become a sleuth too at Western Washington University! The Foulplay club lets you act out your Sherlock fantasies by giving you the chance to play elaborate murder-mystery games. At a game, you’re given a character book and have a few hours to figure out who the murderer is while cautiously interacting with your fellow friends — who may be your enemies! According to the 
, “It’s to DIE for!”


Florida State University – 


There are only two collegiate circuses in America, and FSU has one of them. Students make the costumes, put up the tent, produce the shows and perform in all the acts. According to its website, the Flying High Circus was created to help integrate men and women when the school became coed, which means it’s been empowering awesome collegiettes for years.


Kutztown University – The Medieval Renaissance Club


Sick and tired of the same-old same-old college lifestyle? Wishing you could just go back to a time when things were simpler and people fought with swords? Then you should head on over to Kutztown University, where the Medieval Renaissance Club hosts a Dinner Theater in the fall and a Renaissance Faire in the spring. Its website also says you’re encouraged to learn skills from the time period “such as carpentry, weaving and chain mail.” Forget Facebook — stage combat sounds much more fun.


Tufts University – 


Sometimes you feel best about yourself when you’re telling other people what you like about them. That’s what the Tufts Free Compliments Club is all about — just letting people know what’s great about them to brighten up their day!


Members stand outside a building on campus with signs that say “Free compliments” and shout niceties at anyone who walks by. One of the members said that they “compliment everyone that walks past, regardless of age, gender, race, whether they have headphones on, whether they are on the phone, whether they are walking and talking with a group, etc.” 
 while also making someone else’s!


Western Michigan University – 


The Dignified Educated United Crust Eaters Society, or DEUCES, was created at Western Michigan University to “bring a stop to the discrimination of crust,” according to its website.


Born from a friendly argument over the best part of a slice of pizza, the group is a social club devoted to eating crust and making sure it “gets the appreciation it deserves.” Sounds laidback and delicious.


Occidental College – 


This is a brand new club starting at Occidental College (it just had 
) that deals with the attitude toward sex on campus. Kristin, one of the founders of the club at Oxy, says the club “is trying to open up a conversation about sex on our college campus. We want to positively influence the hookup culture on our campus as to make talking about what makes our experiences great instead of keeping them taboo.”


The club’s future includes speakers and meetings focused on different sex topics.
