When Pope Francis celebrates Mass on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia on Sept. 27, he’ll be speaking to more than 1 million people gathered to witness history.


But for a group of young people from Indianapolis, it will feel like he’ll be speaking directly to them.


Ninety students from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and Butler University are going on a pilgrimage to the City of Brotherly Love, the pope’s last stop on his three-city U.S. tour, which also includes visits to Washington, D.C. and New York City.


The students are traveling on buses with 
, the Downtown church that has become home to a growing number of young Catholics in Indianapolis.


The Rev. Rick Nagel, pastor of St. John’s and chaplain at IUPUI, is leading the group of young people, who have reinvigorated the city’s oldest Catholic church.


In five years, St. John’s membership has grown from 250 to about 1,700, and 65% of those people are under the age of 35, Nagel said.


“The Holy Spirit is really working in our young people’s lives,” he said.


The church has been intentional about reaching out to young adults in the city, particularly as the Downtown population has boomed.

JC Aguilar, an IUPUI junior from Warsaw, Ind., is among those who will make the 11-hour road trip. He’s still processing the idea that he will be in the presence of the pope — even if he doesn’t get close to the man himself.


“I’m excited to experience it, but it will be even more meaningful because I’ll be in a community of people, of believers. I don’t think the pope wants it to be all about him. It’s all about getting closer to God.”


Nagel agrees, saying he expects it to be “life-changing” for those in attendance, particularly young people.


He remembers how his first papal visit changed him. Nagel was a young man in his 20s living a secular life, as he describes it, in the early 1990s. “I treated people well, but I was really out for me,” he recalls.


Raised in a strong Catholic family in Rensselaer, he said he fell away from the church as a young adult. He graduated from Purdue University and worked in sales and education for several years. Then providence intervened.


He was asked to chaperone a group of high-schoolers attending World Youth Day in Denver in 1993. It was there that he first heard Pope John Paul II in person.


“John Paul II changed my life,” he said. “It was profound, and I knew I was called back to a better life.”


It didn’t happen overnight. It took several years before he answered the call to enter seminary. Now 50, he has watched the pendulum shift, as many fell away from the church in the wake of the sex abuse scandal. But the resurgence of young people leaves him hopeful.


“They are seeking something more in their life,” Nagel said. “Our young people seek authentic relationships; they really desire that. Maybe it’s a reaction to social media and those surface relationships. They want to dive deeper, get to know people, to love and be loved.”


Gaby Figueroa: “I have to be there; it’s the pope.” (Maureen Gilmer/The star)


Gaby Figueroa, 22, is ready for that awakening. The IUPUI senior grew up in St. Anthony’s parish on the Westside and acknowledges it’s difficult to be a Catholic today.


“The Catholic Church is not afraid to say what it believes in and explain why,” she said. “It’s really easy in today’s world for people to be easily persuaded or not really stand firm in what they believe.”


Pope Francis, elected to succeed Pope Benedict on March 13, 2013, has gained legions of fans with his humble style, his compassion and his recent statements on abortion, annulment, divorce, immigration and climate change.


“How beautiful is that,” Figueroa said. “He’s keeping us on our toes, but there’s a reason for that. He really lives out the faith in a very beautiful way.”


But make no mistake, Nagel says. “He’s very orthodox. He’s relatable, authentic and direct, but he sometimes packages messages in a way that make them more palatable. He connects with young people, but I think he’s made the biggest impact with fall-away Catholics.”


In a move to bring healing to a church that has been buffeted by controversy, Francis, 78, has declared 2016 a 
 and has said there is no sin that can’t be forgiven.


“What’s amazing about Francis is he resonates with people of all faiths,” said Greg Otolski, director of communications for the 
. “He has a down-to-earth style that is easy for people to identify with.


“For people who believe in God’s mercy and forgiveness, it’s always greater than anything bad we’ve ever done.”


In Philadelphia, the pope will speak during the Festival of Families at Independence Hall on Sept. 26. The next day, he will celebrate a public Mass in the same area.


Actor Mark Wahlberg will host the Festival of Families, which will include performances by Aretha Franklin, musical groups The Fray and Sister Sledge, comedian Jim Gaffigan and singers Jackie Evancho and Matt Maher.


Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin is traveling with other archdiocesan staff to Washington for papal meetings and will be in Philadelphia as well. Joining them for the 
will be 50 parishioners from the 39-county archdiocese, who competed in an essay contest to win a spot on the trip.

The St. John’s contingent will be staying at a retreat outside of Philadelphia and will be hiking 4 miles into the city center for Sunday’s Mass. Their tickets and transportation were prearranged, but 10,000 free tickets to the Mass were snatched up in 30 seconds, according to a CNN report.


Laura Hollowell, an IUPUI senior, understands the fervor associated with the pope’s first visit to the United States.


“We see him on TV, we read his encyclicals and listen to his homilies, but to actually see him and be in his presence will be exciting,” she said. “I just love him; he is adorable.”


Aguilar appreciates the pope’s message of mercy and compassion for others.


“We live in this world that tells us what makes us happy, but that’s not true at all, because when I followed that path, I wasn’t happy. My faith has helped me to love to serve others. I get joy from that. It makes me smile, and that feeling is awesome.”
