When Amanda Greenfield graduated from Notre Dame High School in San Jose, Calif. at the beginning of June 2012, she wanted to move away from home and attend a four-year university right away.


Unfortunately, because of financial reasons, this was not a reality for Greenfield. She ended up attending West Valley College, a two-year community college in Saratoga, Calif. instead of her first choice,  the University of California, Santa Cruz.


“I was super pouty about having to go to West Valley out of high school because the reasons I could not attend UCSC were all money-related,” she says with a laugh when recalling those days. “I had a horrible attitude and I was super grumpy about it.”


Two years later, Greenfield, who recently graduated in May with an associate’s degree in liberal studies with an emphasis in arts and humanities, will transfer to University of California, Santa Barbara as a psychology major in the fall.


Greenfield is among the approximately 
 students who make the switch from community colleges to UC schools each  year.


The 
 consists of 10 separate schools, five medical centers, and about 233,000 students. There are 112 community colleges in California filled with students who often choose to transfer into the UC system after two years.


However, statistics show a disparity among community colleges when it comes to the number of students who end up enrolling in UC schools. Santa Monica College sent 
 students while Feather River College in Quincy, Calif. sent just one.


The following chart shows the 10 California community colleges that transferred the largest numbers of students into the University of California system for the 2012-13 school year.


In other words, about half of all the transfer students come from less than 
 of California’s community colleges, many of which are located in more wealthy regions such as Cupertino and San Diego.


According to the 
, this concentration on richer areas is one reason the transfer system reduces ethnic diversity within the UC system. An article notes that African-Americans and Hispanics make up nearly half of the community-college student population, but only account for approximately a quarter of students who transferred into the UC.


Miles Nool, who just finished three years at Mission College in Santa Clara, Calif. and is transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles as an art history major in the fall, says she has experienced this discrepancy among community college transfers personally.


“I haven’t met anyone else from Mission College who’s going to transfer to a UC,” she says.


At 77th place, Mission College transferred 44 students to the UC system last school year.


Cassandra Reynoso, who recently finished two years at De Anza College in Cupertino, Calif. and will be a media studies major at University of California, Berkeley next school year, attributes the disparity to the fact that the UC system may not be for everybody.


“A college in the California State University system is just as good,” Reynoso adds. “UCs are more theoretical and are more research based. CSUs, on the other hand, are more practical and hands on. It’s all a matter of preference because the UC system isn’t for everyone.”


The CSU system features 23 campuses, making it the largest four-year university system in the nation. CSU schools are also a bit cheaper at $5,472 per academic year for those taking over six units as opposed to UC schools, which are about 
 
.


Wilson Tsai, a business administration major who just finished his first year at University of California, Berkeley after two years at De Anza College, agrees with Reynoso, noting that every community college student has his or her own set of goals.


“In terms of generating a good workforce and making society and the state a better place for young people, I wouldn’t say solely emphasizing UC transfers is the best idea,” Tsai says.


As a result of the statistics, a comprehensive 
, spearheaded by the 
 UC President Janet Napolitano,assembled in December 2013 gives key recommendations for reducing the imbalance that was presented at a UC Board of Regents meeting on May 14.


The 
 had five main strategies: amplifying the UC’s message to potential transfer students and informing them they can afford a UC; increasing the UC’s presence at all community colleges; simplifying the transfer process; creating “Transfer Success Kits” that include a collection of campus transfer services; and committing the UC system to working with the CCC and CSUs to engage in the state’s transfer pathway.


The proposed “Transfer Success Kits,” include services such as guaranteed on-campus housing, transfer resource centers, peer mentoring, summer programs, and a transfer credit evaluation.


Reynoso agreed that peer advising is a good tactic to use because getting advice from people who have actually experienced the transfer process is more beneficial.


“I personally feel like we do have a lot of good resources for transferring at De Anza,” she says, “But I feel like nothing can beat personal, one-on-one teachings.”


One of her peer mentors was Tsai, who graduated from the same high school one year before she did. Tsai also supports the idea of implementing more peer assistance. He believes this method is more effective than seeking guidance from adult counselors and advisors.


Although Tsai did not seek or receive support from counselors at De Anza, both Greenfield and Nool attribute portions of their successes to faculty members who assisted them. Greenfield, who played volleyball during her time at West Valley, relied on the guidance of one of her sports counselors while transferring.


Greenfield also credited Jennifer Zier, an admissions representative from Santa Barbara, who came to West Valley to give a presentation on UCSB and answer the questions students had about the school.


“I felt like there should have been two of her,” Greenfield adds. “She came with a presentation and talked to us about what we wanted to do. I’m not sure if all the other UCs are doing that, but they definitely should.”


Nool made an appointment with her art history professor, whom she had taken class with for two years. Her professor helped paint a realistic vision of prospective job opportunities and made her more aware of her true passion for art history. However, she notes that the UCs could have made it more apparent to all community college students that it is indeed possible to afford transferring.


Nool had her UC application fees, as well as the costs to travel to Los Angeles and attend orientation, waived because of her academic qualifications. But she wouldn’t have known about these cost reductions if she hadn’t asked.


If the UC abides by the suggestions of the UC officials, it would give a special focus to the 30 community colleges that typically transfer the least amount of students into the UC system.


Reynoso says it is smarter to look at the situation on a case-by-case basis, rather than trying to change the entire transfer system. She suggests that before they decide to invest in their ideas, UC officials should take surveys on each campus with the students and figure out what the students want.


“Money, especially in higher education, is scarce and it wouldn’t be a good idea to just throw it anywhere,” she adds. “Each school should really study its student population to figure out what they need.”


Nancy Shulock, executive director of the Institute for Higher Education Leadership and Policy at Sacramento State University, tells the 
 that it is important to remember that no single method will equally benefit all community colleges.


“Don’t assume every community college has the same needs and strengths,” she says.


Nool agrees it is wise to look at each school separately before spending money, although she supports the idea of sending more resources to community colleges since she experienced firsthand how challenging it can be to be aware of transfer information.The report predicts that full implementation of these connected activities will take anywhere between 12 to 42 months.


Ultimately for Tsai, the best method for solving the transfer discrepancy is not by providing increased counseling services, but more about getting quality professors and making sure there are enough open class sections for students at each community college.


“It’s not about counseling, but about emphasizing academics within a CC,” Tsai says. “That’s where it all starts.”
