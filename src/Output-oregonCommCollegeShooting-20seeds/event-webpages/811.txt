Ohio’s Oberlin College is one of the liberal arts schools participating in Experimental College. (March 5, 2013)


College students can now take a class in Pokémon for credit. At least, that’s the idea behind Experimental College (ExCo) programs at select liberal arts schools around the nation.


Students present a class syllabus to a board of their peers, and it is evaluated based on its merit for a full semester’s worth of material. If it is approved, it becomes another class offered at that institution.


Oberlin College freshman Ryan Yates said that ExCo “doesn’t interfere with the normal education because there’s a limit on how much credit you can (receive), so it’s not like it pulls people away from other things — it just presents more opportunities.”


Many, if not most, of the classes offered to students are not available through the typical curriculum. Naomi Pomerantz, another Oberlin student, teaches “Body Positivity and Fat Acceptance.” It is her third semester teaching the class.


“My co-teacher … and I developed this class so we could help people learn about this issue and learn to feel better about themselves,” said Pomerantz. “Our class is discussion-based, so it really is a conversation between the students.”

Her favorite aspect of teaching is “hearing the feedback from students who often use the tools and knowledge we teach them to educate their friends and family.”


This feeling of satisfaction is common amongst teachers. Nicholas Loh has taught classes that have been extensions of pre-existing student-run clubs.


“The ExCos have provided me with invaluable teaching experience, an opportunity to scout out potential future members for these clubs and an opportunity to get to know a diverse population of students who I wouldn’t normally socialize with,” said Loh.


“What I find unique about the Oberlin ExCo experience is a chance to develop a different type of relationship with your peers: You are teaching them information and learning from their reactions how to communicate your ideas. It’s a process and skill that extends well beyond what actually occurs in my classes.”


While small schools can use this type of learning, it is not necessarily the best option for large institutions, Yates said.


“There would be a lot of people trying to make small courses for 15-30 people that would all need to be approved by the program,” he said.


“At that point, it loses some of the ‘by the students, for the students’ feel we get from it here.”


However, University of California – Davis is one of the exceptions, as one of the only schools with a population of over 30,000 students that employs the experimental college. Although those classes do not count for credit, they are offered to both students and community members.


Experimental College fosters exploration, helping students discover what they love and how to incorporate it into their lives. The program, regardless of the opportunities to obtain, gives students the chance to learn new skills and subjects to which they normally would not be exposed.


During Stanford’s 2005 commencement speech, Steve Jobs credited a calligraphy class that helped him develop the trademark of the Macintosh computer.


Jobs put it best: “The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking.”
