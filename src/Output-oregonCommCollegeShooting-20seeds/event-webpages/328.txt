Directly following a deadly shooting spree and subsequent car chase in Moscow, Idaho earlier this month, University of Idaho (UI) students received no emergency alerts from campus authorities.


“We reviewed the incident and we feel that maybe we should have sent out an alert that said there had been a shooting but the shooter was in custody and that there’s no danger to the campus community,” said Ron Smith, UI vice president of finance and administration. “We are going to add that to our procedures.”


Three people were killed during the incident and while police responded at a location just three minutes away from the UI campus, the college did not utilize its emergency notification system to contact the student population until nearly eight hours later.

REPORT: 


Detective Bill Shields of the Moscow Police Department released an 
 of probable cause for the issuance of an arrest warrant for John Lee, 29, on three counts of murder in the first degree and one count of attempted murder in the first degree.


According to the affidavit, Moscow police were dispatched to an office of Northwest Mutual at 2:31 p.m. where they found David M. Trail, 76, who had sustained multiple gunshot wounds. Trail was transported to Pullman Regional Hospital and pronounced dead. Police also found Michael M.M. Chin, 39, who had  sustained several gunshot wounds and who originally called in the shooting. He was taken to a hospital and was in serious condition.


Police received a second call at 2:39 p.m. from an Arby’s restaurant on Peterson Drive and found Belinda G. Niebuhr, 47, in the parking lot with multiple gunshot wounds. Niebuhr was transported to Gritman Hospital where she was pronounced dead.


Around 3:15 p.m., the UI executive director of public safety contacted the Moscow police department and found that Lee had fled to a neighboring county and was about to be in custody, Smith said. By the time the information was formally conveyed, news of the shooting had spread via police scanners and social media, said David Duke, Moscow Chief of Police.


Police in the neighboring town of Pullman, Wash. pursued Lee in a high-speed chase. Lee lost control of the car and police took him into custody, according to the affidavit. Officers later found Lee’s mother, identified as Terri L. Grzebielski, dead with multiple gunshot wounds in her Moscow home.


At 3:44 p.m., the emergency notification system at Washington State University in the neighboring town of Pullman, Wash. sent out an alert to students via text message. The alert included the following:


“A shooting was recently reported in Moscow, Idaho. The suspects fled North past Colfax. There does not appear to be a threat to WSU Pullman at this time. Exercise appropriate caution. See alert.wsu.edu for more information.”


The University of Idaho released its first official statement to its students via email 11 p.m. that evening.


“When there was no danger, we wanted to make sure we had all the facts and knew exactly what the situation was until we sent out an alert. We finally felt that we should send something out to alert students that the danger had passed,” Smith said.


WSU Emergency Management Coordinator Elizabeth King said the school’s emergency notification system has proved effective in the past. The WSU Office of Emergency Management answers to the campus police, and police Chief Bill Gardner contacted the office by phone during the shooting and requested that they send out an alert, King said.


King said that the criteria for sending out an alert to WSU students changes depending on the situation, but in the past, situations that pose a threat to the general student population result in a notification.


Johnathan Paul, a University of Idaho senior, said he found out about the shooting on Facebook. He said he feels the university should have released a statement sooner.


“I feel it would have been appropriate to hear about,” Paul said, adding that he felt the eventual statement released by UI was not very detailed.


In the past, UI has used its Vandal Alert system for a variety of circumstances, including weather alerts, a power plant fire, a mumps outbreak and a loose moose on campus, Smith said.


“If there’s an issue involving campus health, we try to use it. But we don’t want to overuse it,” Smith said.


He said in a meeting following the shooting, campus administrators agreed that they could have send out a message at 3:15 indicating that a suspect was in custody and there was no danger to the campus.


“We probably will write that into our protocol,” Smith said.
