The Rhodes Scholarship, which provides funding for two or three years of study at the University of Oxford in England, announced its 2015 winners yesterday. The list is annually announced the Saturday before Thanksgiving – the 32 winners are chosen from nearly 1,600 applicants, who must first be endorsed by their college or university and then are placed into one of 16 districts. The strongest candidates in each district are invited to interviews.
