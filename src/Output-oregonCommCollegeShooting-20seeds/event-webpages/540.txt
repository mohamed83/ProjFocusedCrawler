Vermont college searching campus for missing boa constrictor

A college in Vermont is searching for its missing 4-foot-long Brazilian rainbow boa constrictor.


Castleton State college sent out a campus-wide email asking students and staff to keep an eye out for the snake, which was discovered missing from its cage Tuesday at the college’s zoology lab.


The school said the snake was not dangerous and was trained to eat only frozen, dead mice.


The Rutland Herald
 reports college officials think the orange-tinged tropical snake was stolen, because its cage had a weighted lid and the door to the room was locked.


The snake was last seen Friday; the rooms are locked over the weekend, and they remained so Monday when the campus was shut down for a snow day.
