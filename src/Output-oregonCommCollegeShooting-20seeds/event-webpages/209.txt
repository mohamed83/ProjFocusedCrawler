A student at the University of Georgia was 
 with felony murder this week after allegedly perpetrating a drug deal that led to the fatal shooting of another student.

Police say Lucas Amsler Raposo, 20, and victim Min Seok Cho went to distribute marijuana to two Athens, Georgia, men on Jan. 13. At the meeting, Cho was shot in the head during an altercation and died in a nearby hospital later that night.


Although police say it’s unclear who pulled the trigger, the two buyers involved in the dispute — Cormaine Xavier Goss, 21, and Andre Ruff, 18 — were arrested on murder charges the next day. But Raposo’s arrest came only after police learned of what happened in the hours following the shooting.


According to 
, Raposo drove Cho to Athens Regional Medical Center after he was shot and left his body lying on the ground in an ambulance bay. He then allegedly threw the gun that Cho brought to the deal into the Oconee River and went back to his apartment to dispose of his bloody clothes and clean out his car.


Cho — a 21-year-old senior at UGA — died at the hospital after Raposo dropped him off.


According to an arrest warrant, “Min Cho was still breathing when Lucas Raposo drove away from the hospital.”


Police say Raposo, a junior at UGA, was additionally charged with felony tampering with evidence and possession with intent to distribute marijuana.


All three men involved in the homicide were denied bail on Thursday.


Under Georgia state law, authorities can charge Raposo with murder for “getting Min Cho to ride with him to a drug deal that he set up and also by having Min Cho bring his pistol,” according to an arrest warrant.
