In today’s digital age, it’s becoming almost habit for many to post pictures displaying claims of happiness and personal success. But as 
 chronicled, for some college students, that’s merely a façade — a mask for inner emotions.


Now, with the prevalence of social media, college students are under immense pressure to appear “perfect” to their fellow classmates. The pressure for perfection can include high grades, a booming social life, involvement in various organizations and taking steps for a successful career. And with that pressure can come feelings of inadequacy, anxiety and stress: emotions that many hide in their deepest reservoirs.

The story is well-known; 
, a popular University of Pennsylvania freshman jumped to her death from the top of a parking garage in mid-January of 2014. Holleran was a runner for the university and had posted what appeared to be cheerful Instagram posts just days before her suicide.


Jacqueline Garcia, a senior at Sam Houston State University, says she knows the pressure all too well.


“I feel like I have to be perfect for every little thing since I went to university,” she says. “All I hear about is competition. I work long hours and, when things aren’t perfect, I get mad.”


Garcia says that social pressures cause her to worry about her ability to land a job out of college and even cause her physical distress.


“It’s overwhelming,” she says. “I have a lot of anxiety about it.”


But the pressure to achieve perfection can manifest in different ways, as observed by Andrea Ochoa, a junior at Oklahoma Christian University, and Julie McCullough, a junior at Syracuse University.


For McCullough, striving for perfection is incredibly difficult because she identifies as an introvert.


“Everything about the university structure — at least at Syracuse — caters toward students who are extroverts,” she says. “You’re supposed to meet everybody, you’re thrown into a room with strangers and, if you want a social life, you have to balance it with good grades. It all doesn’t leave time for relaxing alone and recuperating.”


McCullough says it can often be hard to admit she’s overwhelmed because people may take such an admission as a sign of weakness. Still, she says that it’s necessary and can help balance out any pressures one may feel.


Ochoa, on the other hand, struggles with striving for perfection at a Christian university. She says that in an effort not to sin — as Christians believe one should try best not to do — perfection is highly sought-after. Having alternative viewpoints has also made her struggle to achieve her version of college perfection while maintaining happiness.


But these three agree that perfection can’t be met and that students shouldn’t be ashamed of that. Each of them had their own bit of advice to share with freshmen, hoping that as they enter college they find solace in their flaws and don’t succumb to outside pressures.

Garcia’s advice was simple: Take a deep breath, know you won’t be perfect in every little thing, be proud of yourself and know that you’ll find a job out of school anyway. Even more importantly, she says, don’t let pressure hurt your health.


“If you want something to be perfect, it’s not going to be that way and you can get sick seeking perfection,” she says.


McCullough advises students to get to know themselves. She says that no matter what, it’s equally as important to be mentally healthy as it is to go to the gym or eat well.


Finally, Ochoa asks that students never fake their emotions.


“Just do your best,” she says.


Most colleges have a counseling center of some sort, where students can meet with and talk to professionals about feelings of stress, depression or anxiety.


All three students encourage others to reach out for help if they need it and to never let stigma or external pressures make them feel ashamed.
