As college advising rolls around, students may find themselves sitting with advisors trying to determine what path is the most appropriate and debating which major to pursue. Sifting through class lists, options of majors and internship opportunities can be stressful. But some Michigan students will be able to focus on something a little less stressful — beer.




Central Michigan University (CMU) 
 focusing on craft beer last fall, the Certificate in Fermentation Science.


Grand Rapids Community College (GRCC), located in Beer City USA, will provide students with the option to obtain 
 in 2016 due to a $2.9 million grant from the Michigan Economic Development Corp, according to the
 Grand Rapids Business Journal
. The program will reside under The Secchia Institute for Culinary Education.


Nate Hock, University of Michigan graduate and first year dental candidate, thinks a certificate program for craft beer is a great idea.


“Brewing is a huge industry in the U.S. and more microbreweries keep popping up, so I think having a formal education on the science behind making alcohol is a great idea,” Hock says. “I would have loved to take electives about brewing for my undergraduate degree.”


Both programs parallel with the state’s strong beer culture and offer students unique experiences in job training and interning to “meet the industry’s growing hiring needs” 
.

Currently, there are brewing education programs at Oregon State University and Central Washington University, among others.


Cordell DeMattei, director of fermentation studies at Central Michigan University, is leading CMU’s inaugural class, which is set to begin this fall.


“Students will learn the biochemistry and microbiology of the entire brewing process from malting to packaging, perform analytic and quality control labs, and design and brew beer,” says DeMattei.


DeMattei notes that the Michigan craft beer industry has experienced “explosive growth” since the ‘90s and the educational opportunities available to aspiring brewers have yet to match that growing industry. But, that is soon to change.


RELATED: 


Hock says that the beer scene on Michigan campuses is continuously growing and many social, academic and philanthropic events are often held at bars and breweries. According to Hock, many students also brew off campuses in their homes and look for new ways to test out the beer culture.


“Drinking beer straight from the tap that you can’t get anywhere else is a very unique experience that a lot of college students find exciting,” Hock says.


The GRCC website states that it is currently working with local brewers to establish a formal curriculum and hopes to have the courses developed by this June.


, intended to be completed in a year and open to both degree seeking and non-degree seeking students. Currently, the Mountain Town Brewing Co. and Hunter’s Ale House are partners with the university’s program.


“Students will have the opportunity to get hands-on experience brewing in professional facilities,” DeMattei says about the CMU program. “As the final part of earning the fermentation science certificate students will be required to do an internship at a brewery or related business.”


Both programs have received positive feedback from the community and students because it addresses the growing, popular industry.


“It is clear that some do not understand the amount of science and technology involved in producing a pint,” DeMattei says. However, these programs seek to change that.
