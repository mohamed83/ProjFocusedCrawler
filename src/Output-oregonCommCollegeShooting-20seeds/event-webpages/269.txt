WILMINGTON, Del. — A Delaware State University 
 at one of the college’s residential complexes in Dover, officials said.


The male student was taken to Bayhealth Kent General in Dover, DSU spokesman Carlos Holmes said. “His injuries were not life-threatening,” Holmes said.


He declined to release any details about the injuries or personal information about the student beyond his gender.


He was shot at the Living and Learning Commons, a university residential facility along Du Pont Highway (U.S. 13), which is north of the main campus and previously was the Dover Sheraton hotel, Holmes said.


The shooting occurred shortly after 4 p.m. ET, Holmes said.


The campus was placed under lockdown as soon as the shooting was reported to campus police, he said.


“It continued to about 7:50 p.m., at which time police determined the threat no longer existed,” he said.


“Whoever did the shooting fled immediately,” Holmes said, noting university officials do not yet know if one or more shooters were involved.


No suspect or vehicle descriptions were available Monday night, said Cpl. Mark Hoffman of the Dover Police Department, assisting DSU police in the investigation of the shooting. Hoffman said it took place about three-quarters of a mile north of the main campus.


No information was available about the circumstances of the shooting, Holmes said.


The DSU Living and Learning Commons opened in August 2013 with student housing and classroom space to accommodate the university’s growing enrollment, according to DSU’s website.


The residential facility has about 300 beds in double-occupancy rooms open to upperclassmen international students, honors students and transfer students, the website says.
