A protestor of the TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline is handcuffed by police in front of the White House.


Alexandra Barlowe woke up on Sunday March 2 with intentions to get arrested.


Barlowe, a freshman at Yale University, was one of more than 1,000 young people who rallied in front of the White House to protest TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline. 


“It didn’t matter if you’ve been protesting for five months or five years,” Barlowe says. “Everyone in that moment was on the same level.” 


TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline has been a political flash point for the past five years. If constructed, the pipeline would carry roughly 830,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta, Canada, to the Texas Gulf Coast. 


Because the pipeline crosses an international border, the route’s approval lies in the hands of President Obama.


Barlowe was one of several young people to attach herself to the fence with plastic zip ties on Pennsylvania Avenue. Once everything was said and done, nearly 400 people were arrested. 


Many of the protestors, including Barlowe, march because they believe this is one of the few ways to put political pressure on Obama. If the pipeline is approved, Barlowe says, it would make it even more difficult to fight climate change. 


Given the relative youth, many of the protestors will live to see the effects of climate change in much more detail than Obama or TransCanada’s CEO.


“Most of the rhetoric was about national, if not global climate change,” Barlowe says.

This wasn’t Barlowe’s first protest, but this one was different.  When she saw snipers patrolling the White House’s roof, she says she had a sudden moment of clarity where she fully understood why she was taking a stand.


“This isn’t about us individually,” Barlowe says. “It’s about something much larger than yourself.”


On environmental issues, young people are becoming the backbone of the protest movement. The group XL Dissent is a grass-roots organization made up of college students. Students from nearly 50 colleges are listed as aiding the cause on the group’s website, yet organizers say more than 100 different colleges and universities were represented at the protest.


Michael Greenberg, a sophomore at Columbia University, helped organize the rally in Washington. He had the idea for a large act of youth civil disobedience last summer, and he was looking for a way to use the “tremendous amount of passion,” he’s been seeing.


The students met at Georgetown University and marched to the White House. Greenberg says the crowd reached across the width of the street for nearly two city blocks.


“We believe this was the largest act of civil disobedience our generation has organized,” Greenberg says. “It was very much a collaborative effort.”


XL Dissent held another rally in San Francisco on March 3, which was organized by Haley Broder, an environmental justice and gender equalities major at the University of California Berkeley. 


Students from UC Berkeley, UC Davis and several area high schools joined Broder in a march to San Francisco’s State Department building, but Broder said police were prepared and put the building under lockdown after a few protesters walked in.

“We hoped for more arrests,” she says. The nine people who entered the building ended up getting jailed and released.


For Barlowe, Broder and many others who oppose the pipeline, Obama’s decision is seen as a chance to make a stand against climate change. Thoughts on the pipeline depend largely on political affiliation and geography.


For those living along the northern leg, the issue is about eminent domain and water security. Outside of the Plains, the pending decision is seen as Obama’s defining environmental moment.


On Tuesday, TransCanada’s CEO Russ Girling says he predicts the northern leg of the pipeline would be built.


Broder — who campaigned for Obama in 2012 — says approval of the pipeline would make her feel betrayed. She says she feels the decision will define Obama’s legacy as a “climate justice champion or pipeline president.”


For the student protesters, the rallies were a chance to show the spirit of protest is still alive in young people.


“A lot of times people call us apathetic,” Broder says. “Students are prepared to stand up and do what is right.”
