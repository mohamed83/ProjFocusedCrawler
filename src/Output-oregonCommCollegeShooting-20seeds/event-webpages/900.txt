Proposed changes in student loan interest rates could raise cost of college

Following a federal takeover of direct lending from the private sector in 2009, Congress sets the interest rate annually on the subsidized Stafford student loan, which would double to 6.8% from 3.4%.




The subsidized student loan interest rate is set to double on July 1, which would increase the cost of the trillion-dollar student loan debt, unless lawmakers intervene.


Following a federal takeover of direct lending from the private sector in 2009, Congress sets the interest rate annually on the subsidized Stafford student loan, which would double to 6.8% from 3.4%.


Attempts by some legislators to abandon fixed interest rates in favor of tying rates to the market have caused concern among debt-ridden students.


Earlier this month, Republicans in the House voted to advance legislation that would tie subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loan rates to the Treasury bond markets, a move that could make interest rates go above or below the current fixed rate depending on market conditions.


Bailey Warren, a recent graduate of American University with almost $80,000 in student loans, said a floating rate would be too much risk. Any spike in the market rate would have a great impact on students with debt, she said.


Warren, 22, said she chose to take out mostly government loans because of the stable interest rate they offered. She looked into Sallie Mae, a private student loan company, but did not like the uncertainty.


“They (said their) rates right now are 6% but they could go as high as 17% or 20%,” she said. “How am I supposed to know when my interest rates are going to change?”


The Republican plan in the House, which is similar to a proposal from President Obama, also includes an 8.5% interest rate cap. Student loan proposals that are being developed in the Senate advocate for a lower fixed rate.


Because student loans last for decades, the market rate could change a lot throughout the time period, said Brian Lindeman, director of financial aid at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minn.


About 55% to 60% of each graduating class leaves with a Stafford loan, he said. The average student at Macalester will have student loans for 14 to 20 years.


Right now, a student loan tied to the current Treasury rates would be below the fixed rate of 3.4%. Still, Lindeman said a floating rate could easily go above it while the student is still holding the loan.


“A fixed rate gives some safeguards that those interest rates aren’t going to a place that is unreasonable,” he said.


The non-partisan Congressional Research Service estimates that under the GOP proposal, the average student borrowing the maximum amount of subsidized and unsubsidized loans would pay $14,430 in projected interest over five years. The average student would pay $12,598 in interest over the same period if rates were to double on July 1 and $7,965 if the current rates remain.


Julie Steigerwald, 22, who just graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said she favors a fixed-rate proposal because she would not want more than a 4% interest rate on her Stafford loans.


With $35,000 in federal loans and $90,000 in private loans, she is rethinking her plan to go to graduate school to get a Ph.D. in archaeology.


“It might even stop me from going on to the career I want,” Steigerwald said. “I don’t know if I can take out any more loans at this point.”


Student loans are one of the largest categories of household debt, second only to mortgages, according to a May 2013 report by the New York Federal Reserve Bank.


Higher interest rates make it more likely for students to get behind on loan payments, Warren said. She hopes to eventually open a café with her friends in San Diego yet she is the only one with a good credit score — the others have missed payments.


“It takes relatively little to kill your credit score,” she said. “It takes years to build it back up.”
