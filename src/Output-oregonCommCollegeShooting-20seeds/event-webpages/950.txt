The top athletes in women’s tennis make a very healthy living, but it takes lots of hard work, plus a healthy dose of talent to get there.


Fighting to the top in pro tennis requires expensive travel, training and equipment. A professional tennis player is the manager of her own business with herself as the central product. Managing time, money and distractions can be the difference between success and failure.


If tennis is your gateway to college, make the most of it. Exit school prepared for the business of life and sport. You’ll need it, even if you never go pro.


Use this opportunity as a launchpad into coaching, marketing, merchandising or networking. Tennis, like golf, is a popular sport among the movers and shakers in the business world.
