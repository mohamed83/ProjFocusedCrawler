A recent study from Georgetown University shows that pharmacology has a 100% employment rate.


So you’ve made it to graduation day and you’re about to proudly cross the stage as your parents take far too many flash photos and cry tears of joy. With any luck and a few all-nighters, you’ve met your goals and are ready to join the working world, but, based on your major, how likely are you to land a job once you graduate college? Check out our list of the 10 most employable majors below, and see if yours made the cut!


• Computer engineering


For those of you who can set up a new computer in just a few minutes or find yourself fielding desperate calls from friends about their technology woes, you’re in luck. It turns out that your tech-savvy ways can be put to use even in today’s touchy economic climate. A 
Forbes
 magazine study revealed that the average salary for a computer engineer with five or fewer years of experience is $60,500.


If you’re interested in technology and can solve problems quickly on your own or with the help of a team, computer engineering might be the major for you. In a technology-driven world, there’s always a need for someone who can make sense of a motherboard or help create the latest software program.


A computer engineering major may sound a bit obscure, but there are 313 colleges in the U.S. that offer a four-year undergraduate program.


• Pharmacology


So you want to be a pharmacist? This will take more than a bachelor’s degree, but all of that hard work will pay off. A recent study from Georgetown University shows that pharmacology has a 100% employment rate. The good news is, you can start your fast-paced pharmacy career sooner than collegiettes in other fields.


After only two years of undergraduate work, you can take the pharmacy college admission test (PCAT) and once you pass, you can start earning your pharmacy doctorate. Don’t worry about job security or stability as a pharmacist. You may have to take a slightly different route than the average graduate, but if you have a passion for the medical field, strong math and science skills and a dream to wear that white coat, pharmacy has a job for you.


• Economics


Here at Her Campus, we like to tell it to you straight. Therefore, here’s the truth — economics is a difficult major. Don’t let that scare you off, though. With the U.S. economy deeply in debt and stories about the next economic crisis splashed across the headlines, there’s rarely been a more important or exciting time to study economics.


Business economics is among the highest-earning majors for women, with an average $64,000 salary. Not only that, but agricultural economics has a 100% employment rate. If you want to learn more about economics, there is a discipline for you — and a good chance at finding a successful job in the future.


• School student counseling 


Ever since you landed your first babysitting job during high school, you’ve loved working with kids. Not only do you enjoy building couch forts and reading bedtime stories, you also pride yourself on being a role model and may have helped a younger brother or sister tackle a tricky homework assignment or sort out which college would work best for them. Despite a troubled economy, school student counselors can proudly report a 100% employment rate.


So how do you become a school student counselor? Like pharmacology, becoming a licensed school student counselor will take more than the typical four-year program. Start with a psychology degree and go from there, but while you’re studying, be sure to take advantage of programs like tutoring and Big Brothers Big Sisters.


• Mechanical engineering


With only 10% of mechanical engineers being female, collegiettes in this challenging field may stand out, but they can rest knowing that the average earnings for this career is $80,000 a year. Science and math must be your close friends, and thermodynamics should not be Greek to you by the time you graduate. An admirable 95% of mechanical engineering majors can boast employment.
