Vector crowdfunding concept in flat style


College students and graduates faced with tuition costs and mounting debt are turning to crowdfunding websites to pay for their education.


It worked for Thomas Septa, a sophomore at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York. According to his
, Septa’s parents kicked him out of their house last summer because of his sexuality, and he was left facing a $7,500 student bill. To raise money to return to school, he created an Indiegogo campaign that raised more than $8,000 from 191 people in less than a month.


An entire generation is being pushed into education-related debt. Approximately 69% of students graduating from four-year colleges in 2013 did so with student debt, and they owed an average of around $28,400,
 from the Institute for College Access and Success.


Crowdfunding is an attractive prospect for those who want to pay down loans. However, those who ask for help with tuition upfront may actually experience more success, says Leonard Lee, spokesman for YouCaring.com, a free online fundraising and crowdfunding website.


 is a 19-year-old with spinal muscular atrophy who has a campaign on YouCaring.com. Despite the limitations her degenerative disease creates, MacDougall graduated from St. John’s College in Annapolis, Maryland, and now wants to pursue a master’s in theology, imagination and the arts at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. So far, MacDougall has raised $61,621 of her $75,000 goal.

“People who are at the earlier stages of their postsecondary or graduate education tend to be viewed as more aspirational and inspiring,” Lee says. “They tend to talk about why their education is so important to them, what a difference it will make for themselves, their families and the difference they hope to make in society.”


If you’re thinking about crowdfunding your tuition or student debt, consider these strategies as you plan your campaign:


Find a free or inexpensive platform


Platforms that have produced success with campaigns related to educational expenses include YouCaring.com, Indiegogo Life, GoFundMe, DreamFund, PigIt, Zerobound and Plumfund.


If you’re asking for money, you want to avoid high fees as much as you can. Find a site that offers membership or free campaigning. Some, such as DreamFund, offer premium memberships that have an annual fee but charge lower fees on donations.


RELATED: 


Most sites charge a fee of 5% of donations once the campaign’s goal is reached. Some sites, including PigIt and Zerobound, charge 8% of the total donations if the goal is not reached. You’ll also be charged a third-party processing fee for credit card donations, typically around 3% per donation.


Money raised through personal fundraising is in most cases considered a gift from the donor to the recipient and is not taxable income, according to several sites. However, you should speak with a tax professional regarding the funds you raise during a campaign.


Create a campaign that works


Crowdfunding is not the time to be shy. You need to provide as much information and color about yourself to entice your supporters to donate. Your campaign should include:


Your personal story: 
The storytelling aspect is what really hooks people, says Breanna DiGiammarino, co-head of Indiegogo Life. “Start off your fundraiser by sharing why you’re here, why you’re so dedicated to it and how it will change your life before moving into the specific project or purpose of the cost,” she says.


Your goal amount: 
Create a manageable goal amount. Don’t expect your entire annual tuition or tens of thousands of dollars in debt to be funded. Create a goal that is moderate and practical.


What you’ll do with donations: 
Donors want to know where their money is going. Indicate whether you’re funding tuition costs, living costs or loan repayment. Or, if you’re trying to pay for books, supplies or other necessities, talk about what they are and why you need them.


“We have a girl who is graduating and asked for donations toward a flute,” says Sara Margulis, founder of Plumfund, a platform that links campaigns with gift-giving occasions. “Generally those campaigns that ask for something specific tend to do better.”


Visuals: 
A video and photos are key to a good crowdfunding campaign. “The more photos you have to tell the story, the more people can understand who the person behind the story is,” Lee says.


Take advantage of your social network


Your campaign is only as strong as your social network, experts say. “It’s your close communities that rally behind you first — about one-third of funds in the first 48 hours of going live are from people you already know,” DiGiammarino says.


Be proactive and consistent with your message to increase your chances of success. To maximize your exposure, DiGiammarino suggests encouraging your supporters to reach out to their own networks to spread the message of your campaign.


Provide updates and show your gratitude


“Frequent updates help keep people engaged and encourages them to spread the word about your campaign,” Lee says. Your updates shouldn’t just be about funding amounts, either. Talk about how donations are helping with your educational journey and any challenges you’re facing. No matter what, Lee says, show a positive attitude. “You want to be as uplifting and inspiring to others as possible.”


When your campaign is complete, provide a final update. And standard gift etiquette applies: Remember to say thank you.
