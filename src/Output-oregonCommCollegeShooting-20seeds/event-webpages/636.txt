Join your Northwest Toyota Dealers and Drive for Education in support  of Eugene and Bethel Education Foundations! Each month, the Northwest  Toyota Dealers Association will be distributing significant dollars to  both Bethel and Eugene Education Foundations.




 




In addition to these funds going to the Education Foundations,  individual schools will also have the ability to earn much needed  dollars on their own through booster clubs and Parent Teacher  Organization’s.


















 
We invite everyone to join the Northwest Toyota Dealers as we all DRIVE FOR EDUCATION!
