Sacramento police said shots were fired just before 4 p.m. in a parking lot next to the baseball field on campus -- along Freeport Boulevard near 9th Avenue. Witnesses said they heard four or five shots and then saw students screaming and running from the area.
"I heard something, 'pow, pow, pow,' like that," eyewitness Jackie Flores said. "And, I saw one of them down on the ground."
Flores said she also saw students run across Sutterville Road to get away.
"People were screaming. Some kids came over here," she said. "They got scared and came over here, like for protection."
After the shooting, bystanders began CPR on one of the victims who was laying on the ground unresponsive. Arriving campus police then took over life saving efforts. But, it was too late for the man.
The man killed in the shooting was a student at the college, a family member said. Family said he was going to school and trying to get his life together. The man had two children.
The college was placed on lock down as investigators got to the shooting scene. Students and faculty were later let out of classrooms and allowed to leave the campus. Sacramento Police Chief Sam 
. the campus was cleared.
Campus is clear...investigation is underway.  We are partnering with campus police (Los Rios PD)but are handling the homicide investigation.

"They locked us in a room and turned out the lights and we been in there for like an hour and a half," student Marketa Moore said. "We were watching the news in class and seeing that somebody died. Yeah, that's scary."
"They shut the lights off and said we were on lockdown and my heart did race a little bit," student Jacklyn Andrade said. "But we're out here and we're good."
Sacramento City College spokesperson Rick Brewer said classes on the main campus were cancelled for the rest of the day. Brewer also said it took the college 40 minutes to send texts and phone messages warning students about the shooting. All text and phone messages were sent by the same system, he said.
Sacramento police are partnering with campus police, the Los Rios Police Department, to investigate the shooting on campus. Sacramento police are handling the homicide investigation.
 "an all-clear has been issued," and Friday classes are expected to continue as scheduled.
