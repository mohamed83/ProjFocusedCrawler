President Obama made a pitch for a free, two-year community college education for any American who wants it, telling an audience in Tennessee Friday that a college education should be “as free and universal as high school is today.”


“America thrived in the 20th century in large part because we made a high school education the norm, and then we sent a generation to college on the GI Bill,” Obama said at Pellissippi State Community College in Knoxville, Tenn.


“But eventually, the world caught on. The world caught up. And that’s why we need to lead the world in education again,” he said.


Obama proposed a state and federal partnership to provide an associate’s degree — or two years toward a bachelor’s degree, or job training — at all of America’s 1,100 community colleges. He said the proposal would be one of the most important elements in his State of the Union Address on Jan. 20.


Obama said students, colleges and states would all have to do their part. “There are no free rides in America. You would have to earn it. Students would have to earn it by keeping their grades up,” he said. “This is not a blank check. It’s not a free lunch.”

Community colleges are the natural place to focus on higher education, he said. “They’re local, They’re flexible. They work for people who work full time,” he said. “That’s what community colleges are all about — that no one with drive and ambition should be left out.”

Details of the plan remain sketchy, but the White House did put a price tag on the proposal Friday: $60 billion over 10 years. That’s the federal share; under a 3-to-1 matching funds arrangements, states would pick up another $20 billion of the cost. About 9 million students would be eligible, and the average student would save $3,800 a year on tuition.


White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said the purpose of Friday’s speech wasn’t to put forward a specific legislative proposal, which will come when the president proposes his budget on Feb. 2. “We are starting a national conversation today,” he said, “about how we can expand college access for all Americans.”


House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, called the plan “incomplete.”


“The speaker is for making college opportunities more available, but the White House needs to fill in the blanks, starting with the cost to taxpayers,” said Boehner spokesman Cory Fritz.


But a similar plan in Tennessee garnered widespread Republican support. Obama’s plan is modeled after the Tennessee Promise — a state-level free-college plan starting this fall, paid for with Tennessee Lottery proceeds.


Obama was joined by Republican lawmakers from Tennessee on Air Force One as he traveled to Knoxville Friday: Sen. Bob Corker, Rep. John Duncan and — perhaps most significantly — Sen. Lamar Alexander.

Alexander, the new chairman of the Senate’s education committee, said he supports expanding community college opportunities but not Obama’s approach.


“The right way to expand Tennessee Promise nationally is for other states to do for themselves what Tennessee has done,” he said. The federal government can help by simplifying the financial aid application and expanding the Pell Grant program, he said.


Alexander and Obama spoke about the financial aid form aboard Air Force One Friday. “Simplifying that form, that;s something that we should be able to agree on,” Obama said. “Let’s get that done this year.”


Corker also questioned the federal role was necessary, saying, “You’re always better off letting states mimic each other,” he said.


Obama seemed to address those concerns, saying, “This work is not easy. Sometimes’ it’s controversial. It’s not going to be the same in every state.”


Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, also a Republican, joined Obama for the speech, saying he was honored by the visit.


“We think the Tennessee Promise is a game-changer when it comes to the history of our state,” he said.
