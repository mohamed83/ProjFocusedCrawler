Transfer students at your university might have benefits not given to traditional students.




The immense sense of relief potential transfer students might feel once they are accepted to their new school is often short lived. It’s quickly replaced with feelings of panic about how they will adjust to a new life, whether they will make new friends and uncertainty over if they made the right decision. What they don’t realize, however, is that there are tons of exclusive perks garnered by the status of “transfer student” that other older students don’t enjoy.


Here are just a few perks that come with being an upperclassman transfer student:


• Less pressure



Students are usually encouraged to declare a major or concentration as early as possible, usually sophomore year. Luckily for transfer students, schools often spend their first semester easing them into a new environment. They sometimes allow them to have a lighter-than-usual class schedule to finish any school-specific graduation requirements. Less pressure to declare a major right away, combined with a lighter schedule, means ample time for transfers to integrate themselves socially into their new school through clubs, sports and work.


• Say “I’m a transfer”



People are friendlier than you may realize. Establishing friendships takes time, but saying, “I’m a transfer, can you tell me where ___ building is?” or “I’m a transfer, where do people usually go to eat after football games?” is a great way to introduce yourself and ask people to show you the ins and outs of your new environment.


• Ready groups



It is easy to feel alone and friendless as a transfer student, but there are hundreds — if not thousands — of other students in the exact same position. For instance, new student programs such as 
 at the University of Michigan, provide student mentorship and host social events for transfers to help them meet people right from the beginning. They also provide contacts to answer any questions transfer students have.


• Automatic diversity



When you’re a transfer student, suddenly everybody wants you. It’s like the title of “transfer student” produces an aura of diversity that many work or social organizations are eager to add to their ranks. For example, it is socially acceptable to crash any Greek mixer because “I’m thinking of pledging” is still relevant, unlike for other unaffiliated upperclassmen. Also, when applying for a campus job or club leadership position, mentioning you’re a transfer student shows you’re taking initiative to be involved instead of keeping to yourself like other transfers might be tempted to do.

There are more advantages to being a transfer student than many people realize. Even though I knew I was transferring into my dream school, I was terrified I would spend my first semester feeling isolated and unhappy.


Actively trying to get involved through a job and student groups, however, introduced me to new people and helped me learn more about how my school works, and my relatively light schedule enabled me to start off with a strong GPA.


Transferring has been great, and no one should be afraid to make the move.
