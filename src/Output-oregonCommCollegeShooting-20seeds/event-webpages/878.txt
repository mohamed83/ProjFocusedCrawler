A university student stabbed his sleeping roommate in the throat, slashed his forehead and chased him to continue the attack when the victim broke free in their Santa Clara University dormitory, prosecutors say.


Dillion Sang Kim, 19, then apparently cut himself before he was arrested; his mug shot showed a knife wound wrapping around his neck with stitches. His 19-year-old roommate remains hospitalized and is expected to recover.


Kim has been charged with attempted murder but did not enter a plea Thursday in court,

. He is being held without bail.


Attorney Emma Bradford, who is representing Kim, was not immediately available for comment Friday.


Authorities have not released a motive but say the attack was unprovoked. The victim, whose name was not released, is lucky to be alive but is doing well, Deputy District Attorney Kalila Spain said.


The victim awoke early Tuesday to find Kim standing over him holding a knife, Spain said.


He stabbed the teen multiple times and cut his forehead and shoulder before the victim could run toward a bathroom that connects to an adjoining room with two suitemates, the prosecutor said.


Kim chased after him and stabbed him in the back when the victim fell down, Spain said.


The roommate made it to the adjoining room, where another student called 911, authorities said. Kim was arrested outside the dorm.


University spokeswoman Deepa Arora said Thursday that Kim has been suspended.
