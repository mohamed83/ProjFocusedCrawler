FSU students, staff head back to class after shooting

TALLAHASSEE — Florida State students, faculty and staff head back to class Friday and try to resume their normal lives after one of the most horrific days in the university’s history.


Burdened by personal crises and paranoia of the government, police say, Myron Deshawn May, a 31-year-old attorney and FSU graduate, opened fire and shot three people, including two students, at 12:25 a.m. ET Thursday at the entrance of Strozier Library.


As of late Thursday, one victim was in critical condition at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare. The second victim was in good condition at the hospital. A third, who was grazed by a bullet, was treated at the scene and released.


One of the victims, Nathan Scott, who worked at the library, issued a statement through the hospital saying he was shot in the leg and was recovering with his family by his side. The family of the other hospitalized man declined to provide his name or give a statement.


Up to 500 panic-stricken students were in the university’s main library when the chaotic scene unfolded. Many barricaded themselves inside, stacking tables and chairs, while others made a mad dash out a back exit, leaving behind laptops, books and even their shoes.


Allison Kope, a freshman from Cocoa Beach, Fla., was about 25 feet from the front door when the melee began.


“I ran for my life,” she said. “I ran right out the back door.”


Two minutes after May began firing, he was shot down on the wheelchair ramp of the library’s outside exit, where his body lay uncovered for more than four hours in the frigid pre-dawn darkness.


The university canceled classes, opened its counseling services to students and had a series of news conferences throughout the day to keep the public apprised of the investigation, which drew coverage from media outlets nationwide.


FSU President John Thrasher flew back to Tallahassee from New York after he was awakened by the news early Thursday. By 11 a.m., he was on campus with Gov. Rick Scott, praising the fast action of law enforcement and assuring the university community it was safe.


Despite the tragedy, Thrasher said FSU would quickly rebound.


“We’re going to get back to normal tomorrow,” he said before a crowded room of reporters at the Florida State University Police Department headquarters.


“Our university is going to open. Our classes are going to be held, and the Strozier Library is going to be open early in the morning,” Thrasher continued. “We’re moving ahead, we’re continuing to pray for the victims and pray for Florida State University, but we’re going to get through this with the great family we have.”


Details are chilling.


Police said May parked his car two blocks away, then proceeded to the library, where he shot two students outside the doors. A library employee was hit just inside the entrance. May also reportedly shot at another woman affiliated with the university, but she was not hurt. Another student said he was shot at, but the bullet was stopped by books in his backpack.


May reloaded his .380 semi-automatic handgun, police said, but never made it past the lobby’s security area. He went outside, where he was confronted by officers from FSU and the Tallahassee Police Department.


TPD Chief Michael DeLeo said May “refused to surrender,” causing officers to fire. Officers and May fired more than 30 rounds of ammunition combined. Police found additional rounds in May’s pocket.


Initial statements from police at 6 a.m. said May shot at officers first, prompting them to fire back. But at an afternoon news conference, DeLeo said investigators were still trying to determine who shot at whom and when. Five FSU PD officers and one TPD officer were placed on administrative leave, as is customary in officer-involved shootings.


“It will take hours and days to put all the pieces together,” DeLeo said. “Everyone wants to know why, and that’s the hard question we are going to continue to investigate and try to find those answers.”


DeLeo said May kept a written journal and made videos in which he expressed fears of being targeted by the government — problems he wanted to expose.


“It’s clear that Mr. May’s sense of being and place in our community was not what most people would refer to as a normal status, and that he was in a sense of crisis, and he was searching for something,” DeLeo said. “We have no information saying that anyone was targeted for a specific reason.”


May, who went to high school in Wewahitchka, graduated from FSU in 2005. He earned a law degree from

Texas Tech in 2009. He practiced law in Texas and New Mexico before returning to the small Gulf County town about a month ago.


Friends said he was paranoid and had financial troubles, but they were shocked to learn that he was the shooter.


TPD and the Leon County Sheriff’s Office never previously encountered May. He had two minor interactions with law enforcement when he was a student at FSU, including a 2002 incident in which officers were called to his dorm room to investigate the odor of marijuana. In the only other campus case, he reported being the victim of a car burglary.


DeLeo and FSU PD Chief David Perry said their officers — more than 50 of whom were on the scene — responded just as they were trained to do. Two weeks ago, FSU police conducted active-shooter training.


The university’s emergency-alert system also worked as it should, they said.


“More than 55,000 people received information about today’s incident within five minutes,” Perry said. “It was an appropriate response. Anytime a call comes in for something of this magnitude it demands a prompt response.”


The shooting elicited an outpouring of emotion and support from FSU, the Tallahassee community and beyond. Hundreds of students turned out on Landis Green hours after the incident for an impromptu vigil in honor of the victims. The tributes continued all day, culminating in a massive candlelight gathering at the Integration Statue on campus.


“It’s one thing to read about these incidents in the newspaper or on the national news. It’s another thing to experience it right here in your own community,” said Andrew Gillum, who will be sworn in as Tallahassee mayor this evening. “If there is any positive news we can take from this occurrence, it is that the victim count was not higher.”
