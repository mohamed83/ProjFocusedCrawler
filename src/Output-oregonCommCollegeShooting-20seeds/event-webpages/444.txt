Survey finds students are spending less on course materials

A 
by the National Association of College Stores released today found that college students spent an average of $563 on course materials during the 2014-2015 academic year, a drop from the average of $638 the year before.


According to Elizabeth Riddle, the director of the National Association of College Stores’ research team, more than 9,000 undergraduates from 23 campuses nationwide participated in the survey. A mixture of private and public schools as well as two-year and four-year campuses were selected for the survey, says Riddle. The chosen institutions represented different geographic locations and with varying enrollment numbers.

Riddle credits decreased student spending on course material to the increasing prevalence of textbook rentals, second-hand book sales and digital alternatives.


“Students are just becoming much savvier in terms of their shopping experience,” says Riddle.


Although sites such as Amazon and Chegg are popular alternatives to traditional textbook buying, the study found most students still turn to their campus bookstores when it comes to buying or renting course materials.

Although they’re spending less on course materials, the report found that students still want them. The amount of course materials purchased, according to the report, remained constant between the 2013-2014 school year and the 2014-2015 school year.


“Students are still finding their course materials valuable and much of that is connected to their instructor’s use of the course materials,” says Riddle. “When instructors assign course materials and effectively integrate them, student use [of the materials] more than doubles.”

However, a study the Book Industry Study Group shared with 
 found students increasingly consider materials listed on their syllabi as “recommendations rather than requirements.”


The survey has not been published yet, but according to Nadine Vassallo, a project manager for the Book Industry Study Group, the biannual study was most recently conducted in February 2015 and included a sample of 1,600 students attending U.S.-based institutions. The students who were polled represented two-year and four-year colleges as well as public and private colleges, says Vassallo.


And Vassallo agrees. She said professors play a large part in making students see the value in their course materials.


RELATED: 


“In order to ensure students continue to acquire and use required course materials, professors need to communicate their value — especially in terms of their relevance to results in the course,” Vassallo told USA TODAY College in an email. “If the professor doesn’t actually use the materials, or if students believe using them won’t improve their grade, they might hesitate to make a purchase.”


Publishers also need to ensure their products are worthwhile investments for students by making the learning process more efficient and more effective, Vassallo says.


Christine Cao, a student New York University, says she does not buy all the books on her syllabi even when they are noted as being mandatory.


“Professors either teach what’s in the book,” says Cao. “So why buy them, or completely deviate from them, making them useless?”
