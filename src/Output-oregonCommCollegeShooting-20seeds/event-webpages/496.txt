Study: Public colleges more exclusive, less responsive to low-income, local students

With college costs 
, lack of affordability has forced some students to pursue non-traditional or less ideal higher education avenues and others to sacrifice college altogether.


Low-income and in-state students in particular will face more challenges paying for higher education costs in upcoming years. Public colleges and universities are increasingly awarding those groups less financial aid funneling it to high-achieving, wealthy, out-of-state students instead, according to a 
.


“Over the last 20 years, state disinvestment and institutional status-seeking have worked together, hand in hand, to encourage public colleges and universities to adopt the enrollment tactics of their private-college counterparts,” says Stephen Burd, a senior policy analyst at New America and author of the report which analyzed the ongoing practice at 424 public colleges and universities across the country. “For many of these schools, that has meant using their institutional aid dollars strategically in order to lure affluent out-of-state students to their campuses in order to climb up the rankings and increase their revenue. As a result, fewer institutional aid dollars are available to in-state students who come from less privileged backgrounds.”


GRAPH: 


Flagships and major research universities are not the only ones playing the merit aid game. The report found the strategy has become an entrenched practice among regional colleges and universities too with, 
 providing scholarships to students who do not need financial aid.


Historically, public colleges and universities produced the majority of the country’s college-educated population by providing affordable public education, according to 
Dissent
, an independent, quarterly magazine focused on politics and culture.


Yet, in their efforts to offset widespread decreases in state investments and increase their prestige, public colleges and universities across the country may have abandoned any sense of responsibility they once had to the in-state students they were founded to serve.

Lauren Shatz, a human services major at University of Delaware, recognizes the reduction in institutional aid for in-state students is problematic, as in-state tuition and fees tend to be the most affordable option for many students.


“I do think that [public colleges] should try to make tuition affordable for in-state students. Some families may not be able to afford out-of-state tuition, private school tuition…paying in-state tuition may be the only option to be able to afford a college education,” says Shatz. “Although merit scholarships can be a great way to convince students to come to a school, larger scholarships should be given to low-income students instead of to those who can afford college tuition.”


Ease of social mobility is another factor affected by the growing trend of public institutions doling out more merit aid to wealthy, out-of-state students.


As of 2014, persons with a high school degree earn, on average, $668 weekly; in comparison, persons with a bachelor’s degree make $1,101, 
. This stark difference in earned income represents a sharp difference in standard of living.

As low-income groups increasingly receive less financial aid from public institutions as a result of schools’ efforts to use aid dollars to recruit affluent out-of-state students, many have few alternative options for obtaining an affordable education and could potentially be without the opportunity to attain a bachelor’s degree.


Jenna Stitik, a Seton Hall University student studying psychology, explained that the new enrollment tactics could potentially lead to a more static class system.


“The issue with this type of set up is that in the future, eventually only the wealthy will be educated and have higher-paying jobs, while less affluent populations will not have the same opportunities and become stuck in the same financial class they were born into,” says Stitik.

Others, such as Luke Svasti, a Rutgers University student studying political science, recognized the negative effect the recent trend has on low-income and in-state students. But Svasti also acknowledged that out-of-state students face higher tuition rates and fees overall and offered merit aid may not necessarily make an institution affordable, depending on how wealthy he or she is. Like low-income students, some wealthy, out-of-state pupils may still face high costs.


“An out-of-state student might be marginally richer, but face far higher costs overall,” says Svasti.


However, in terms of income brackets, the report suggests low-income, local students are ultimately still affected by the change in enrollment tactics more harshly.


In 1996, 
 went to students in the lowest income bracket, and 16% went to students in the highest income bracket. By 2012, 
 to the poorest students, and nearly as much was going to the wealthiest.


 public colleges that provide sizeable amounts of merit aid have experienced more of a decline in the enrollment of in-state freshmen since 2000. They also tend to enroll fewer students with Pell Grants and charge low-income students a higher average net price than those that provide less merit aid.


This year, the University of Tennessee’s board of trustees endorsed a plan that will allow certain campuses to increase the number of out-of-state students they enroll to as much as 25% of their undergraduate population, as part of its plan to fill a projected 10-year, $377 million funding gap, according to 
.


“The only way to preclude tuition increases is to fix it ourselves. It is about maintaining quality and moving ahead. We will be a different organization in the next four to five years,” said Joe DiPietro, the university system’s president, in a statement 
.


Yet DiPietro’s statement, like New America’s report, raises a question: Should the country’s public colleges and universities strive to maintain quality, move ahead and be different at the expense of an entire student population?
