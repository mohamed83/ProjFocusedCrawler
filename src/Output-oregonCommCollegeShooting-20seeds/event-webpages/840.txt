Here is a list of ten online 
 that can be helpful for both young and experienced students.


There are guides that are quick and easy to follow and there are very intensive ones as well. There are guides that give tips that students may use as their personal grammar rulebook. And there is even a guide that may help inspire one when composing his own 
 template and plan.


All the resources suggest quite different approach and information on essay writing, so choose the one that fits your needs the best and watch your writing improve.


1. 


This is a guide that gives very basic and general information on how to write an essay. It is not for someone trying to get the highest grade and is not for overachievers. It is for people in high school that have not written many essays and for people that need a quick refresh on writing essays. The biggest advantage of this resource is its simplicity. It doesn’t go into masses of details, that make the guide easier to use.


2. 


Essaymama’s Essay Writing Guide was created by professional writers that had to write essays for their living. Over time, they have learned a lot of tricks and tips for getting higher grades, and they shared these tips via this resource. Besides, the guide has quite easy and accurate structure, so you will not have to spend much time to find the information you need. If you want to get general information on writing essays along with practical tips then you should look through this guide.


3. 


This website suggests in-depth and comprehensive guide on writing, but unfortunately it has an outdated form of navigation, so you may find yourself searching for quite a while before you get what you want. If you plough through and keep searching, you will find some very in-depth and very correct information you can use to improve your writing skills and your essays.

4. 


This may be one of the most correct writing websites on the Internet. There are no secret snippets of information on this website that will get you a better grade, but there is correct information about grammar and the English language. It is the sort of website a teacher may use to ensure he or she teaches the right thing. Think of this website as a rulebook for the English language that eventually will improve your writing skills.


5. 


This is not a guide on grammar or the English language like the OWL resource, nor a loaded with tips and advice like the EssayMama guide. This is a website that gives you general strategies for essay writing. The authors of the resource have written articles on each of the essay elements, that make the website easier to use and to find the information you look for.


6. 


This is a short writing guide that is probably mostly used by people that need a quick refresher on how to write essays and a quick reminder on essay writing concepts. If you are not sure how to write essays, but you are also not too worried about getting a higher mark/grade, then this resource is suitable for you. It may be brief, but it is definitely better than most of the YouTube videos you are going to see on the subject.


7. 


This is another website that offers a very basic and very short refresher course on writing essays. It has been built by a university but is so simple that a high school student could use and understand it. The resource gives a list of possible steps while writing essays and tells how to succeed at each of them.


8. 


This is a downloadable resource that gives you a rundown of how you may write essays. It starts with the basics and then goes into more details as to how you may write each section of your essay. If you have a tablet reader, it may be a good document to load and read in sections when you have free time or when you are traveling on a bus or train, for example.


9. 


If you suffer from writer’s block, then this is the perfect resource for you. It is set out as if it were an essay-writing plan. However, it is not for people that have no idea how to write essays. This is for students that consider themselves to be very good at writing essays and want to create an essay writing process and template to make the writing process easier. Think of it as a checklist or shopping list full of things you need to consider when you write your essay.


10. 


This is a PDF file that offers a guide to writing your essays. It starts simply with thing such as how to plan and structure your essay, and then moves into writing, drafting, refining and checking your work. It then goes into the different types of essay you may write and the styles you may be asked to write. Once you have read it all, you may use it as a reference guide. So for example, if you are asked to write a research paper you can check with the PDF on how to do it correctly.
