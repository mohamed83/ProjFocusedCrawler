Jonathan Krueger was 
 this week as a student with an “infectious smile and a drive for adventure, an exuberance that swept others up to see life differently.”


Krueger, a junior and photo editor at the
 Kentucky Kernel,
 the University of Kentucky’s student newspaper, was shot and killed April 17, the victim of what Lexington police are calling an attempted robbery.


Justin D. Smith, 18, and Efrain Diaz, 20 have both been charged in Krueger’s death along with a third male, 17, who’s name is not being released because he is a juvenile. Smith and Diaz are charged with murder and robbery, and Smith is also charged with tampering with evidence. The 17-year-old is charged with murder, robbery and tampering with evidence.




Smith and Diaz pleaded not guilty on Monday during a brief court appearance.


Another man who was walking with Krueger at about 2:00 a.m. said a minivan pulled up and confronted them. The man said he was able to escape and call police, according to a report in the 
Louisville Courier-Journal.


Those who knew Krueger are still struggling to understand the killing.






The more I think about it, the less it makes sense. Everybody deserves to walk home from school safely 
 Jonathan Krueger.

Praying for the friends and family of Jonathan Krueger. No one should have to go thru this. Senseless acts of violence have to stop. Now.

The Kernel Press Inc. has started 
. Once $10,000 is raised the Kernel will award an endowed scholarship to a promising Kernel photographer. As of April 23, 
 had received donations in excess of $23,000.


University President Eli Capilouto sent a note to students and staff last week calling the killing “incomprehensible.”


“Although this tragedy occurred off-campus, it is a stark reminder that all members of our campus community should at all times be vigilant about their safety and the safety of others. We are each other’s keeper,” Capilouto wrote. “It is also in a moment like this that we are reminded of how fragile and precious life is.”
