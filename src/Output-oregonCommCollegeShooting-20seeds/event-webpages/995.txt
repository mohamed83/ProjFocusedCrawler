CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — The man wanted in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham is in custody in Galveston, Texas, Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo said Wednesday.


At a brief news conference, Longo did not detail how Jesse Matthew, 32, was taken into custody or if any evidence relating to the missing student was recovered.


Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset said Matthew was found on the beach near the Gilchrist community on the Bolivar Penninsula, a strip of land on the Gulf Coast northeast of the city of Galveston, GalvestonDailyNews.com reported. He was found about 3:30 p.m. local time Wednesday.


That location is more than 1,200 miles from Charlottesville.


The Galveston County Sheriff’s Office would not release further details, but Trochesset said investigators from Charlottesville will travel to Galveston on Thursday, KHOU-TV reported.


Graham, 18, disappeared early in the morning of Sept. 13 and has been the object of a search.


Matthew has been charged with abduction with intent to defile. He is represented by attorney James Camblos, who was commonwealth attorney for Albemarle County for 16 years.


Charlottesville police said they obtained an arrest warrant for Matthew, who they believe was the last person seen with Graham.


Before Longo announced that Matthew was in custody, Camblos said he spoke with the suspect but wouldn’t say if he knew Matthew’s whereabouts.
