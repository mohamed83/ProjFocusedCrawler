The Columbia University Library in New York in February 2012.


Columbia University sophomore Chad Washington, 19, allegedly assaulted another student on May 5, and used racial slurs against his Asian victim, 19. 
The Spectator
, Columbia’s newspaper, reported that on Wednesday, Washington — a defensive lineman for the Columbia Lions — was charged with aggravated harassment as a hate crime and released without bail. He is due to appear in court on July 8.


Thursday evening, Columbia’s Asian American Alliance, a campus organization that works with the Asian Pacific American community to create a sense of social awareness, released a statement. Signed in support by more than 30 campus clubs and organizations at the New York City school, the statement advocates for the creation of more intensive on-campus anti-hate and anti-oppression programs to combat the culture of hate and violence.


The Asian American Alliance urges students to stand in solidarity against all forms of identity-based discrimination, claiming that the presence of diverse ethnic and racial identities on campus is not enough.


“We see this incident as a result of broader systemic racism on our campus and our society,” the press release states.

Racial tensions are not unique to Columbia’s campus — incidents of racially motivated aggression have been reported at schools across the country. In March, the administration at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, declared a day of solidarity, canceling classes in response to the campus sighting of an individual dressed in a robe resembling those worn by the KKK. Last April, Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., 
 after a student protest received threatening backlash.


Hateful acts on college campuses aren’t uncommon. The Southern Poverty Law Center’s 
 reports that every year, over half a million college students are targets of racist, sexist and/or homophobic-based slurs or physical assaults.


“The college must take the stand that students of all backgrounds, all walks of life, all colors and sexualities, are to be treated with equal respect,” said Ankeet Ball, a freshman at Columbia.


Campus intolerance manifests both physically and verbally. University of Michigan sophomore Minji Kang describes the subtle, insensitive comments she hears light-heartedly weaved into conversations. Although at first she cringed at the offensive jokes and language, she now speaks up when she witnesses crude comments.


“Instead of merely cringing and allowing for such language, I tell people to just stop,” Kang said.


The Southern Poverty Law Center, which is cited on Columbia’s 
, encourages students to challenge hateful words and acts, support victims and generate a continuous dialogue.


“Apathy, in some ways, is as dangerous than hate,” the organization asserts.


Columbia sophomore Jessica Chi said she believes that intolerance is best combated by creating dialogue about individual accountability and emphasizing every member’s own responsibility in making college campuses a safe and accepting place. Ball agrees.


“Safe campuses are crucial to produce the best students that a college can offer,” Ball said. In return, college students can study and live without the fear of being harmed or disrespected.


“No one should ever have to live in an environment marked by disrespect or intolerance,” Chi said.
