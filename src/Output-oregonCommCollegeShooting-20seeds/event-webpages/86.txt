Oregon School Shooting: God sent the Shooter! Time to repent, America! Why will ye die? 
 


— Westboro Baptist (@WBCSaysRepent) 




In their latest series of shocking tweets, the Westboro Baptist Church, fresh from picketing the Pope’s visit to the U.S., announced their members will picket the funeral of those killed in Roseburg, Oregon. 


On the morning of October 1, 
 killed multiple people at Umpqua Community College. He was killed after exchanging gunfire with responding officers. 






Here’s what you did when 
 came to Oregon: 
 God repays with the 
. We pray you be reconciled to God!


— Westboro Baptist (@WBCSaysRepent) 




Shortly after news of the tragedy broke, 
 with their members tweeting “God repays with the #UCCShooting. We pray you be reconciled to God!” 


Lauren Drain is the daughter of the Westboro Baptist Church's de-facto leader Steve Drain. She was banished by the church as she sought to not be a hateful bigot. 


A 
 with a similar hateful message, included that hashtag “#funeraldeetsplease.” The first tweet in the series read “God sent the shooter for Oregon’s proud sin. We told you God will repay you to your face.” It was accompanied with the church’s feared 
 hashtag. 


The “church,” made their name in protesting the funerals of victims of tragedies — somehow relating the deaths to acceptance of homosexuality in society — has proven time and again that no tragedy is safe from the group’s vile opinions. 


Chris Harper Mercer has been named as the shooter who killed multiple people a Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, October 1.
