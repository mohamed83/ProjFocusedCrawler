Rita Cavin, the interim president of Umpqua Community College, issued a brief statement Thursday. “We are still sorting through, trying to reunify students with their families,” she said. “Tomorrow the college will be closed. This weekend the college will be closed for all student activities.”


The college will reopen Monday, she said. “Right now it is a crime scene.”


Ms. Cavin said she had spent time at the fairground where those without injuries were taken. “We have families waiting for the last bus to arrive with students on it, and we have grief counselors for parents who have no children coming off that bus,” she said.
