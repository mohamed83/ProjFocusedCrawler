PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — President Barack Obama addressed the country Thursday evening 
 and injured at least 7 others.


In his 15th White House press briefing on the subject, Obama said the U.S. is becoming numb to mass shootings and that perpetrators have “sickness” in their minds.


“Somehow this has become routine,” Obama said. “The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have common sense on gun safety laws.”

He said thoughts and prayers are no longer enough in these situations because they don’t do anything to stop similar acts from happening in the next week or a few months later.


“We spend over a trillion dollars and pass countless laws to prevent terrorist acts on our soil, and rightfully so,” Obama said. “And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?”


The president urged Americans who use guns safely to hunt, for sport and to protect their families to think about whether their views are being represented fairly in government.






"We are the only advanced country in the world that sees these mass shooting every few months." —

“It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun,” Obama said. “If you think this is a problem then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views.”


In his address, President Obama said the American people are accountable for the rampant gun violence taking place in our country today.

“This is a political choice we make to allow this to happen every few months in America,” he said. “We are collectively answerable to those families who lose their loved ones.”


In his final remarks, Obama said he hoped he would not have to address another mass shooting during his tenure as president.


Vice President Joe Biden spoke about the shooting at a global summit in New York. He said he predicts investigators will find that a semi-automatic or automatic weapon was used.


The Vice President renewed his call for what he describes as “sane gun legislation.” He said the 2nd Amendment doesn’t allow someone to own a bazooka.


Biden said there’s almost nothing worse than getting a phone call saying, “Your child is gone.” He was alluding to his own son’s brain cancer death earlier this year.
