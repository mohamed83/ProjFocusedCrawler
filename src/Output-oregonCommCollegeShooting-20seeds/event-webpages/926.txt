Students at the University of Texas at Austin are continuing to voice their desire to remove the statue of Confederate President 
 on campus. The statue was recently spray-painted with the tags, “Black Lives Matter” and “Bump ALL The Chumps.”

This is 
 the statue has been vandalized. On May 10, 2015, the phrases “Davis Must Fall” and “Emancipate UT” were scrawled on the statue.

In March, student body president Xavier Rotnofsky and vice president Rohit Mandalapu made the 
 a part of their campaign. Student government voted to remove the statue because they disapproved of the ideals Davis stood for — slavery and racism, according to Rotnofsky.


Rotnofsky 
 that those things are “just not in line with the university’s core value” and many students voiced their agreement.






 I asked about this during orientation, and I'm glad to see progress is happening!

Following the 
 the movement to remove the statue has gained momentum.


Students signed 
, addressed to University President Gregory Fenves, asking him to “immediately remove the statue from campus.”


Dear President Fenves,


We, the undersigned, stand with the students of The University of Texas at Austin and ask you to immediately remove the statue of Jefferson Davis from campus.


Statues serve to glorify and memorialize the values of what the subject stood for. Given Jefferson Davis’ vehement support for the institution of slavery and white supremacy, we believe this statue is not in line with the university’s core values—learning, discovery, freedom, leadership, individual opportunity, and responsibility. It is impossible to reach the full potential of an inclusive and progressive learning institution while putting an idol of our darkest days on a pedestal.


This year marks the 150th anniversary of Juneteenth, the holiday commemorating the abolition of slavery in state of Texas. However, it is apparent from headlines across the country that there is still much more room for progress. In light of recent events, there has been a national conversation about the meaning and place of the Confederate flag and symbols of the Confederacy. In the same way that the Confederate flag projects values of racial hatred, the Jefferson Davis statue memorializes a man who stood for racial inequality and bigotry.


The petition has since secured over 2,000 signatures.


But some disagree with the student’s claims.


Don Carleton, executive director of the Briscoe Center for American History at UT-Austin, told 
USA Today College 
that the statue’s artist, Pompeo Coppini, wanted the statue to “show the reconciliation between the North and South during World War I.”


“It was not conceived as a tribute to the confederacy, it was used to show reconciliation,” Carleton says.


 Fenves met with UT student leaders on Monday to discuss the issue. Fenves said he plans to research the history behind the statue and meet with student leaders before deciding the fate of the statue.
