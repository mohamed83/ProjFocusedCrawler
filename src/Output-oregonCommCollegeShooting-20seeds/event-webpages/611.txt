Leaving your family, friends and country for some time to pursue a college education can be difficult. Some international students do not fully comprehend how overwhelming life in another country can be until they actually start their college careers.


Despite the challenges of moving to another country for college, the number of international students on college campuses is progressively growing. 
 conducted by the Institute of International Education, the number of students studying in the U.S. has increased for seven consecutive years. There are currently 40% more international students studying in U.S. colleges and universities than 10 years ago.


With the growing number of international students on U.S. campuses, it is possible that your time in college will be the first time you will meet an international student. How can you ease the transition for students from abroad?


Five international students sat down with me and reflected on their college experiences in the U.S. thus far. They gave some words of advice to American students — on how they can help international students adapt to life in the U.S. — as well as to prospective international students.

Be more patient and learn from international students. Don’t just expect them to be exactly the same as you are. Don’t just think of them in American context, but learn to appreciate different sides of them.


As for international students, reach out as hard as you can and break out of the comfort zone. 


It might sound very cliché, but studying in a different country is all about putting yourself out there to learn, to explore, to get hurt, to get rejected and still keep holding on.


 It requires a lot of courage, but most importantly you have to believe that American students are essentially the same as you and you will always find a way to talk to them about both their culture and your culture — both Game of Thrones and romance fiction you read in your mother language.


I think it is important to maintain your tie with your cultural group — I still very much enjoy Chinese history and literature and love explaining it to my American friends. The most difficult thing for international students is ultimately how to tie their own cultures to American culture while maintaining a balance between them. It is similar to dealing with a sense of ambiguity on dual-nationality. Make sure you can figure out where you belong.

I wouldn’t say I was treated differently as an international student. Luckily for me, I was part of the many international students at Cornell University and there were two Cornellians who had attended my high school.


Cultural gaps are inevitable. I remember feeling that people were cold and were not interested in readily pursuing conversation. I had to remind myself that I was in a different culture and that it would take time before I felt comfortable.


I think a general piece of advice would be to assume nothing when interacting with international students. This is mainly because there are students coming from all over the world and it is impossible to know everything about the cultures they hail from. I would say that as an international student the last thing you want to do is keep to yourself. 


I think it is important to interact with people different than you and ask questions.

A couple of things attracted me to the U.S. At British universities, you pick a subject before you start, and you more or less only study that subject for the entire degree. I liked the exploratory quality that the American liberal arts system offered me.


The novelty of my British accent and mannerisms [have] yet to wear off for most people. This can be annoying sometimes, but at other times it is invaluable social capital. But there aren’t really any substantial differences in the way I’m treated by the institution.


There are countless cultural differences. It’s very difficult to pin down exactly what they are though. The only way I can really describe it is as a different way of being in the world. I am endlessly misled by the illusive similarity of language. In other words, it confuses me that Americans speak the same language but just seem quite different.


My advice for American students is that we’re human beings too, and we don’t bite.

I was always intrigued by cultural exchange and intellectual conversation between East and West. Living on one side of the earth did not give me a complete view of the world, which motivated me to explore the other side.


For both American students and international students, my advice would be to stay open-minded for anything you are not familiar with. 


Try not to take ‘stereotypes’ seriously and try not to judge others in advance — be brave and ask questions when you are not acquainted with the situation. A cultural gap is an opportunity to learn instead of a problem.


If you sincerely want to make friends [with] diverse backgrounds, you can try to step outside your comfort zone, smile and say ‘hi’ first. Don’t be over protective. Once you believe that people around you are nice, they become really nice. Do not set expectation for others. Never expect others to think the same way as you. Try to respect the difference and learn the best out of it.

In terms of cultural gaps, one thing I never realized prior to studying in the USA was the amount of diversity within the country. I always considered a person American but have come to understand the differences that exist across the states.


I had always been welcomed in the nicest way possible, which I think is most important. People were tremendously interested in hearing about my story and why I chose to study in the USA. My advice for international students is to put yourself out there. 


Studying for four years in a foreign country is a great opportunity and not one that most people are able to have. Make the most of it. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes because that’s the only way you’ll learn.


It’s unfortunate to see many international students sticking within the international bubble. Take risks, ask questions, and leave your comfort zone. And I assure you that in the process you will have some of the best experiences of your life — I know I have.
