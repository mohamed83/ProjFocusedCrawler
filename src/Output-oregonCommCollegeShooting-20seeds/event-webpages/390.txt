Also sometimes called junior, technical or city colleges, community colleges are typically public institutions providing college-level, enrichment and vocational classes and programs in a smaller, more local and less expensive setting than traditional four-year colleges and universities. According to the American Association of Community Colleges
[
]
 , there are 1,132 community colleges in the United States; 986 are public, 115 are independent and 31 are tribal.


Typical costs:
Full-time community college tuition and fees (typically for two 15-unit semesters) can cost 
 $1,000-$12,000 
or more a year for state residents, and 
 $4,000-$30,000 
or more for out-of-state students, depending on the school, the location and the program of study.
For example, tuition and fees at community colleges in Texas
[
]
 for 2013-2014 are 
 $1,630-$6,153 
for state residents and 
 $4,150-$16,683 
for out-of-state students, with an average cost of 
 $2,394 
for Texas residents and 
 $6,322 
for nonresidents. At Century College
[
]
 in White Bear Lake, MN, tuition and fees for two 15-unit semesters total 
 $5,356 
for general classes, 
 $5,540 
for dental hygiene courses and 
 $5,846 
for the nursing program.
Tuition is just one of many college expenses. In order to award financial aid and scholarships, each school predicts its "cost of attendance
[
]
 " for a typical student to attend for a full academic year, based on estimates for tuition and fees; books and supplies, room and board, transportation and personal expenses. The COA at community colleges varies from 
 $7,500-$25,000 
or more for state residents and 
 $12,000-$35,000 
or more for out-of-state students, depending on whether student live with their parents/relatives or on their own, and the local cost of living.
For example, Santa Barbara City College
[
]
 in California estimates 2013-2014 costs of 
 $1,378 
tuition and fees; 
 $1,710 
books and supplies; 
 $4,518 
room and board for living with relatives and 
 $11,268 
for living away from home; 
 $2,844-$3,096 
for personal expenses; and 
 $1,180-$1,324 
for transportation, for a total COA of 
 $11,822 
for students living at home and 
 $18,524 
for away from home; for out-of-state students, the COA is 
 $17,758 
if living with relatives and 
 $24,460 
for out-of-state students living on their own. In Texas
[
]
 the average COA for 2013-2014 is 
 $14,921-$16,275 
for Texas residents and 
 $18,841 
for out-of-state students.
Two-thirds of community college students nationwide attend part-time, according to the American Association of Community Colleges
[
]
 . Tuition for state residents typically costs 
 $45-$250 
or more per credit unit/hour, or 
 $135-$750 
for a standard three-unit class. For out-of-district or out-of-state students, tuition can cost 
 $100-$550 
or more per credit unit, or 
 $300-$1,650 
to take one three-unit class. Additional mandatory per-student fees plus other costs like lab fees or a parking permit can add 
 $25-$200 
or more to the total cost for part-time students, depending on the school.
Many community colleges provide an online net price calculator, which allows students and their parents to enter basic information and get a rough estimate of the total amount they might have to pay after receiving typical grant and scholarship aid, based on their individual circumstances. For example, Community College of Philadelphia offers a net price calculator

What should be included:
Community colleges are typically outcome-oriented, leading either to career employment or transfer to a four-year university, according to Mott Community College
[
]
 in Flint, MI. Most community colleges offer vocational certificate programs, two-year associate degrees and college-level classes that satisfy the general requirements for the first two years at a four-year university (for transfer students). Many also offer classes for local high school students who want college-level classes, and continuing and adult education programs.
Community colleges typically cost less and offer smaller classes, more night classes and more flexible scheduling options than most four-year universities. However, they may also have a more limited curriculum and a less-active campus life. Scholarships.com lists the pros and cons of community colleges

As they age, members of the Baby Boomer generation don't like to admit that they're senior citizens, but they love getting discounts. It's kind of a quandary, because some of the best deals available are reduced prices for older folks.
