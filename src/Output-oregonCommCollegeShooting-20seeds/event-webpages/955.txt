The University of Nebraska-Lincoln offers a unique course in Great Plains Studies.




Looking for an unusual classroom experience on campus? Some schools offer courses, majors and minors that break away from the norm.


Take a look at some of them here:


Pirate Certificate— Massachusetts Institute of Technology


If you’re a student at MIT, a certificate of piracy is just four classes away. MIT students started requesting a pirate certificate five years ago and was developed within the school a few months later, according to Carrie Sampson Moore, director of physical education. Students must complete sailing, fencing, pistol and archery classes to become pirates.


Once that is done, a secret oath is administered.


“I do have alumni calling me,” Moore says. “We’ve awarded a few pirates retroactively.”


MIT awards roughly 25 students the pirate title each year.


For Dirk Stahlecker, a sophomore computer science major from Pocatello, Idaho, the certificate allowed him to find his love of sailing.


“When I first heard it was an option, I thought it was a joke,” Stahlecker says.


Having originally come to MIT from doing robotics in high school, he says the physical education classes he’s taken are a welcome break from studying in the classroom.


He says he isn’t sure if he’s going to call himself a pirate on his resume, but he might mention it as a talking point.


“It just shows that I like branching out and doing something different,” Stahlecker says.

— University of Missouri


Do you have a passion for diversity? The University of Missouri offers a multicultural certificate for those who wish to facilitate cross-cultural interactions.  This 15-credit hour program allows students to pick and choose certified classes to earn the certificate.


Etti Naveh-Benjamin, director of the multicultural certificate program, says it is “very individualized” as students can focus on a specific culture.


Sarah Barr, a senior journalism major who is headed to law school, says more students should pursue the certificate because “you really don’t have to go out of your way.” Barr says she was happy with the flexibility of the program and how it allowed her to combine all of her passions.


The majority of students with this certificate come from the College of Arts and Sciences, while the School of Journalism is a close second. Peer advisers largely run the program, Naveh-Benjamin says, because “it’s much easier to talk to a student.”


Since it was founded a little more than eight years ago, 2,000 graduates have already earned the certificate.

—Frostburg State University



Students at Frostburg State University in Frostburg, Md. can take part in an emerging field — ethnobotany. Simply put, it is the study of the relationship between plants and people.


Sunshine Brosi, an assistant professor of biology, heads the ethnobotany program. She says ethnobotany is a mix of hard and soft sciences. Students who take part in this interdepartmental major get the chance to go out into the field and help conservation efforts.


From 2002 to 2007, Brosi played a key part in an effort that helped restore butternut trees in several southern national forests with collaboration from the eastern brand of the Cherokee Indians.


Benjamin Brown, a senior ethnobotany major, stumbled on the area of study by looking through Frostburg’s course catalog three years ago.


“The liveliness and eclectic perspective of the program is what hooked me,” Brown says.


Brown explains that his coursework combines material covered in pharmacology, ecology, history anthropology, economics and sustainability— a mix which Benjamin says makes classes much more interesting.


Frostburg State is the only university in the continental U.S. with the major.


— University of Nebraska-Lincoln


If buffalo and windswept plains fill your dreams, a major in Great Plains studies might be just for you. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln offers a interdisciplinary major, which combines courses from more than 20 departments to offer a comprehensive look at the middle portion of North America.


According to Charles Braithwaite, chief advisor of Great Plains studies, students who graduate with this major have gone on to work in a variety of industries studying the plains.  But, according to a Nov. 11, 2013, 
 infographic, only three students were enrolled in the program last semester.
