Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this article’s headline misidentified the victim as a University of Texas-Austin student. He was not a student at the university, nor is his alleged killer.


AUSTIN, Texas — In an affidavit obtained from Travis County records, the 18-year-old man found dead in West Campus Friday morning was allegedly killed by his boyfriend during a drunken dispute.


Bryan Michael Canchola, 20, is currently in custody of the Travis County Central Jail awaiting a formal filing of a murder charge, a first-degree felony. According to autopsy results, Canchola’s boyfriend, Stephen Roy Sylvester, Jr., died as a result of head trauma.

A suspect is in custody in connection to the murder of a 18-year-old man Friday morning, according to the Austin Police Department.


According to the arrest affidavit, Canchola and Sylvester were residing in an apartment under a subleasing contract at the GrandMarc Apartment complex located at 510 West 26th Street. In the early hours of Friday, Canchola’s and Sylvester’s roommate said the two came home after drinking on Fourth Street.




 










































The roommate went to his room to sleep and stated that around 4:13 a.m. he heard a culmination of screaming and banging. The roommate walked out of his room and said Canchola screamed at Sylvester, “Why would you cheat on me?” The two then came out of their room pushing each other. The roommate told them to keep it down, and the two went back to their room after apologizing.


The roommate said around 4:20 a.m. he heard more screaming and thrashing. He said he heard Sylvester scream, “Let go; I’m trying to leave.” Sylvester’s dog yelped and Sylvester could be heard telling Canchola to “Let the dog go.”


The roommate then started banging on the door and eventually made his way in the room. Canchola became aggressive toward the roommate. The roommate said he noticed blood spattered on the wall of the bedroom.

The roommate went to the kitchen where Sylvester retreated and noted that he was holding the back of his head. Blood was pouring down the back of Sylvester’s neck and onto his shirt. As the roommate helped Sylvester gather his belongings to go to the hospital, Canchola punched Sylvester on the side of the face, causing him to fall to the ground. Canchola also threw glasses at them as they left.


Shortly after checking Sylvester into University Medical Center Brackenridge, Sylvester unexpectedly left the hospital without being treated. The roommate went to a friend’s residence to call 911 out of fear that Sylvester may have returned to their apartment to work things out with Canchola.


Shortly after, Canchola also called 911 to report that he and Sylvester had been fighting. He said Sylvester was bleeding from the back of the head and was unconscious.


Police arrived at the apartment complex at around 5:50 a.m. Police said Sylvester was taken to UMCB where he later died.


Autopsy results show he suffered bleeding on the brain and a fracture in his neck. He also showed signs of strangulation. Sylvester’s dog also sustained injury indicative of strangulation.


According to the affidavit, Canchola sent texts to his stepfather about the fight and indicated that he was “scared, in trouble and did not know what to do.”


The affidavit also reports that, according to an officer on the scene, Canchola changed his clothes at some point while EMS personnel were tending to Sylvester at the apartment.


The officer also stated that Canchola had apparent blood on his lips, hands and feet. He noted that there was a “considerable lack of blood on Sylvester which suggested to him that the body may have been cleaned prior to his arrival.”


Canchola is currently in custody with bond set at $500,000.
