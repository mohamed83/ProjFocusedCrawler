Student journalists and student media in the U.S. and Europe have begun responding en masse to the deadly attack in Paris.


The fatal shootings inside the newsroom of the provocative satirical magazine 
Charlie Hebdo
 and the subsequent suspect manhunt and hostage situations have attracted global media attention. It has been reported that the shooters were seeking revenge on 
Charlie Hebdo
 for its cartoons depicting the Islamic Prophet Muhammad in unflattering poses and sacrilegious situations.


In editorials, interviews and blog posts, student editors have expressed sympathy for the slain magazine staff while simultaneously reflecting on related issues involving freedom of expression, satire, journalist safety and the “
 against Islam at large.”

“To say the attack was horrific, reprehensible, abhorrent and brutal is true,” 
The Independent Florida Alligator
 team at the University of Florida 
 in an editorial, “but those words still fail to capture how this feels for us — not to mention what it means to the people of France. … We can only hope that 
Charlie Hebdo
 and its satire — which must exist if a liberal, democratic tradition is to continue — are not defeated by this attack.”


Top editors at 
The Triangle
, the student newspaper at Philadelphia’s Drexel University, similarly stressed the importance of free speech without fear and the sheer lunacy “of fighting a pen with a gun.”


As they 
, “Everyone is entitled to their own opinion; it is a human right. What one group finds offensive, another finds humorous, while another is indifferent. We have all been angered by something we read in a newspaper, a Facebook post, or even in a textbook. Even though we are angry and upset, that does not give us the right to justify any wrong by taking the life of another.”


In a larger sense, was 
Charlie Hebdo
 justified in publishing the controversial Prophet Muhammad cartoons?




The Mancunion
, the student newspaper at UK’s University of Manchester, says yes.


As 
Mancunion
 staff 
 in an editorial, “No idea, belief or policy should be exempt from criticism or mockery. The Prophet Muhammad is no exception. Once people, particularly us as journalists, start believing that they cannot speak or write about a particular organization or belief, tyranny and stupidity are allowed to flourish.”


Peter Gowan, a student at Ireland’s Trinity College Dublin, respectfully disagrees.


In an op-ed for 
Trinity News
, Gowan 
 that the current mass sharing of the Muhammad cartoons is unnecessarily inflaming an already combustible situation and further disrespecting the Muslim people.


In his words, “The caricatures that most people have been sharing from 
Charlie Hebdo
 are intentionally designed to offend Muslims. … The cartoons are not something that most tolerant, open-minded people would produce. They are the free expression of people with negative opinions towards the Islamic faith. 
Charlie Hebdo
 had every right to mock the Prophet Muhammad, and nobody had a right to murder its journalists or use force to prevent it from doing so. The fact that this right exists, however, does not mean that we ought to express its opinions, and in fact there are many reasons why sharing the caricatures from 
Charlie Hebdo
 will have a negative impact on people who may be close to you, and on the overwhelming non-violent majority of Muslims.”


Alligator
 editors at UF also expressed concern about this negative impact — specifically the “pundits and hatemongers” already using the shootings to blast an entire religion.


As they 
, “The predictable backlash against Islam at large is not only misguided and simplistic but incredibly disrespectful. … The attack against 
Charlie Hebdo
 should be treated [as a singular event]. Pretending otherwise is to prey on ignorance and frustration as well as politically benefit from a tragedy.”


Amid the horror and spectacle of the tragedy, UCLA student Natalie Delgadillo is reminding the public and the press to not lose sight of the “quieter injustices” plaguing journalists worldwide every day.


As she 
 in a blog post for 
The Daily Bruin
 student newspaper, where she works as opinion editor, “In many ways, what happened at 
Charlie Hebdo
 was special, unusual, exceptional. In many more ways, it was part of a predictable and consistent pattern of violence against and restriction of the press. Journalists are killed on a regular basis. Journalists are arrested and unjustly imprisoned even more often. … When we think about the extreme violence of 
Charlie Hebdo
, let’s think about that, too. Let’s think about the 61 journalists that died doing their jobs last year. The ones that are still being imprisoned for doing their jobs. This happens, this is happening. Let’s not proclaim ‘je suis Charlie’ and forget we did it when the sting of this most recent tragedy fades.”


Dan Reimold, Ph.D., is a college journalism scholar who has written and presented about the student press throughout the U.S. and in Southeast Asia. He is an assistant professor of journalism at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, where he also advises The Hawk student newspaper. He is the author of 
 (Routledge, 2013) and maintains the student journalism industry blog
