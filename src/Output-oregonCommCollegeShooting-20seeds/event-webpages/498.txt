“
I need to get as far away from home as possible.”


That’s the goal a number of high school students have when choosing where to go to college. It may sound tempting to leave the East Coast for the West or to abandon the Midwest in search of a place where it’s always warm and sunny. But it’s not always that glamourous.


University of Missouri


I left Illinois — the only home I’ve ever known — to go to the world-renowned journalism school at the University of Missouri. I didn’t really know anyone and I had never been apart from my family for more than a week, so the seven-hour distance might as well have been the distance from Mercury to Pluto.


RELATED: 


One thing I definitely did not expect was that Missouri and Illinois, two bordering states, could be so different. People in Missouri could tell I was an outsider. I say “pop” instead of “soda.” I have a “Chicago accent.” I didn’t know Missourians call the capital “Jeff City” instead of “Jefferson City.” I was amazed at the nuances between states most people couldn’t even distinguish between on a map.


I’ll admit going to an out-of-state college was at times definitely harder than I expected. As a freshman, I sometimes felt alone even in a room full of people. I missed my family’s noise when I was in my quiet dorm room. After getting my heart broken and not having a familiar support system to help me, I had such a hard time recovering that I went to counseling for a few weeks. Two of my out-of-state friends went into depression.


Going out-of-state for college is not always easy and I would definitely not recommend it to everyone. But if you can get through the rough patches, I promise it’s worth it. These are some ways to deal with the culture shock that helped me.


1. Call your mom


Or your dad. Or your brother and sister. Call people who you’ve known for a long time and represent familiarity. I owe all of my success in college to my mom because she’s been my best friend and biggest cheerleader. Our phone calls have meant everything to me and I cannot stress just how much hearing her voice has helped me through tough times while I’m away at school.

2. Meet people


You hear it all the time, but getting involved can take the feeling of isolation away from anyone’s college experience. Joining my campus television station helped me meet some of the greatest people I’ve ever known, especially considering we had common interests. If you’re worried about not making friends, the best advice I can give is to dive headfirst into the water and open up to strangers. You never know who you could have standing up at your wedding with you in 10 years.


3. Find out more about your new state


You plan to live there for four years and you don’t even know the capital? You’re sending large amounts of money to the university, so the least you can do is Google some general facts about it. You’ll probably pick up on details from in-state students you befriend. (Did you know when people say they’re from “St. Louis,” they actually typically mean “St. Louis County” and not the city?) You’ll probably discover many things your new city and state have to offer and you won’t feel so alone.


4. Visit home when you can, but don’t do it every weekend


Making time to go home, see your family and visit with your high school friends is important. But you’re away at school to learn and get a degree. How can you expect to ever fully adjust to a college if you’re leaving all the time? Plan to go home once a month at most.


5. Don’t be afraid to ask for help


I know a girl who had a horrible roommate situation and was extremely homesick for her family who was eight hours away. Yet she chose not to do anything. Instead, she just became increasingly miserable. Don’t let this happen to you. If you’re struggling, don’t stay in a sticky situation. Get yourself out or seek help.
