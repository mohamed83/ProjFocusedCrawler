The deadly shooting at a North Carolina community college this week is being investigated as a possible hate crime, a Goldsboro Police investigator said Tuesday.
Sgt. Jeremy Sutton declined to provide details on the case against Kenneth Stancil, accused in Monday's fatal shooting of Wayne Community College print shop director Ron Lane.
Stancil, 20, was arrested without incident early Tuesday in Daytona Beach, Fla.,  Volusia County Beach Rescue Capt. Tammy Marris said. Marris told USA TODAY that Stancil admitted killing Lane.
"He did confess, but he did not say why he did it," Marris said. "He complied with all orders and was taken into custody without incident."
reported that Stancil, at a court hearing Tuesday, said he killed Lane because the print shop director molested the suspect's brother.
Stancil had once worked for Lane before being dismissed from the school's work-study program for excessive absences, the college said. Stancil's mother, Debbie Stancil, told WNCN-TV that Lane "made inappropriate sexual advances" that had upset her son.
Brent Hood, Lane's supervisor for three years, told the Associated Press that Lane was gay, but said he didn't think that's why Lane was killed.
"He (Stancil) was angry over getting dismissed from his duties," Hood said. "If he had other reasons or motives, it was not clear when he worked here. He worked very well with Ron; he worked very well with my other employees."
Stancil fired one shot at Lane, who had worked at the school for 18 years, from a pistol-grip shotgun and immediately fled the campus, Sutton said. 
The tragedy shocked the campus community, and the school was immediately placed on lockdown.
Law enforcement officers swept through every campus building in pursuit of the gunman. Scores of police officers, tracking dogs and a helicopter conducted a manhunt for the accused killer. Hours later, Stancil's motorcycle was found abandoned on I-95 South in Lumberton, N.C.
On Tuesday, deputies with the Volusia County Beach Patrol said they found Stancil illegally sleeping on the beach. Stancil had a knife and was taken into custody after telling officers who he was, Goldsboro officials said.
Stancil was being held in a Florida jail without bond; Sutton said he hoped Stancil would be extradited to North Carolina by week's end.
Lane was killed shortly after 8 a.m. Monday in a bathroom on the third floor of the Wayne Learning Center. Classes resumed at the school Tuesday, although the building's third floor was closed.
"We are relieved at the apprehension of Mr. Stancil," school spokeswoman Tara Humphries said Tuesday. "This is a day of healing. We will be paying personal tributes to Ron Lane."
Wayne Community College is a two-year school with about 4,000 students. According to its website, it offers 100 degree, diploma, certificate and continuing education programs.
