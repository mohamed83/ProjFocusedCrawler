N.J. bill proposes lottery to pay off college debt

New Jersey could become the first state in the country to create a ‘golden ticket’ for student loan debt.


If N.J. State Assemblyman John J. Burzichelli is successful in passing his sponsored bill, a new lottery would be created to help students rid themselves of college debt — one by one.


The idea was put into action after Burzichelli was approached with the plan by local business leaders.


“They looked at N.J. and thought it would be a market where the game could work,” Burzichelli says. “I’m not suggesting that the idea of a lottery fixes the larger problem, but it could be a novel way to bring some relief.”


The 
 was introduced on June 29 and “would provide a market-based solution for rising college expenses and burdensome student loans.”


RELATED: 


Current students and alumni would be eligible to participate, but each person must have their student loan balance authenticated prior to the purchase of the lottery ticket.


The bill says many would benefit: 
 graduated with debt in 2013 — the fourth highest percentage of any state in the country.


But not everyone looks forward to a gamble.


“I don’t like that this is what legislators are spending their time on,” Natalia Abrams, executive director of 
 — a non-profit organization that advocates for affordable education — says. “They should work on comprehensive reform that could help tens of thousands of students in their states versus only one lottery winner.”


Abrams says the initiative would only benefit the company leading the lottery, as opposed to the student loan borrowers the legislation says it would help.


According to the bill, 
 would be used “for expenses and profit” regarding the lottery’s developer, administrators and managers.


RELATED: 


However, even Burzichelli admits the proposal is a rough copy in need of work. The bill currently sits in committee, awaiting a hearing that will come in the fall.


“Another thing we haven’t taken into consideration yet is what happens to the credit and debt associated with these for-profit colleges … that’s still being worked on,” he says.


Engelbert Santana, senior counselor at Rutgers University-Newark says that “at the end of the day the initiative is nothing more than a lottery.”


“And what are your odds of winning a lottery?” he asks.


Others, however, are willing to place a bet on the lotto for a way out of loans.


Jorge Cariaga accumulated $47,000 in debt while studying at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, N.J. After pursuing a master’s degree at St. Peter’s University, also in the Garden State, his loans add up to $114,000.


“I would still play hoping to pay off my loan. Either way, it would be an easier route,” Cariaga says. “Interest has been piling up. If I can get loan forgiveness, I’ll still be in debt for 10 years. As of right now, a bachelor’s degree won’t help me anymore…. how am I supposed to save money for my house if I have to keep on paying off my loans?”
