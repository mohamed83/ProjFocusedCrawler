The shooting took place in classroom 15 in a building called Snyder, where English and writing classes are held, a student, Cassandra Welding, said.


Ms. Welding, 20, was in classroom 16 — next to the shooting — when the violence began.


She was working on a short class paper when she heard several loud bursts, like balloons popping. There were about 20 people in the classroom.  A woman seated behind her rose to shut the classroom door, she said, and was struck in the stomach by several bullets.


“He was just out there, hanging outside the door,” Ms. Welding said of the gunman, “and she slumped over, and I knew something wasn’t right. And they’re like, ‘She got shot, she got shot.’ And everyone is panicking.”


A friend of the injured woman dragged the woman into the room and began administering CPR, Ms. Welding said. Someone clicked the door shut. Someone shut off the lights, and the students huddled in the corner, blocking themselves with desks and backpacks. “I heard more shooting,” she said. “It was horrific.”


“My whole body was shaking, a chill was going down my spine. We called 911,” said Ms. Welding. “I was on the phone with my mom pretty much the entire time. I knew this could have been the last time I talked to her.”
