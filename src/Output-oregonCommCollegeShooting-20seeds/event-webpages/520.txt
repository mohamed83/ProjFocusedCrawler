The body of Vicente Mundo, a 20-year-old junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who was reported missing Jan. 25, was found on the side of a rural road Jan. 31 several miles south of the U. of Illinois.

Mundo was the second person reported missing on U. of Illinois’ campus within the past 30 days. The first, a U. of Illinois graduate named Christian Zamora, is still missing.


Daniel Gonzalez and Reginald Scott — both students at Parkland College in Champaign — were arrested and charged Feb. 2 for 
. Each was charged with three counts of first-degree murder. If convicted, Scott and Gonzalez face a minimum of 45 and 35 years in prison, respectively.


“The prosecution of these two men will occur over the coming months, and the pain felt by Vicente’s family and friends will never cease,” says Jeffery T. Christensen, chief of police and executive director of public safety of the U. of Illinois police department. “But we hope this news brings some comfort and assurance that these two men are not a danger to others,”


Remembering Vicente 


Before an autopsy confirmed the identify of Mundo’s body, his sister, Julieta LaMalfa, said she suspected it was his.


“I never imagined being in this painful position. However, the support and help from the community has been truly, truly overwhelming,” says LaMalfa. “My next most important thing is to thank everyone and to tell them how amazing he is and that that’s what I want people to remember. I don’t want it to be overshadowed of what these people have done to them.”

A vigil for Mundo took place Feb. 2 at St. Gall Catholic Church in Chicago, according to a memorial 
 managed by his family. For those who could not attend the Chicago service, a second was held at 
 at the U. of Illinois that same evening.


Mundo was a mentor who kept his peers on the right path, making sure they stayed on top of their school work, says Annette Guzik, Mundo’s former high school classmate and a current U. of Illinois junior.


“I just feel so blessed I had five years with him,” says Guzik. “This whole experience is teaching me that the sweetest things in life are the most ephemeral, and that’s what he was.”


While Mundo’s Theta Chi fraternity brothers also mourned his death, they — like Guzik —  have learned from it.

“I love him and I miss him — I know we all do. I learned a lot from this and there’s nothing we can do except be with each other,” says Isaac Bahn, a Theta Chi member. “Vicente wouldn’t have it any other way.”


“It was only a couple of us that came from Curie (High School) so we stuck together like a wolf pack,” says Erika Castillo, one of Mundo’s former high school classmates.

During a difficult moment in her freshman year of college, Castillo says Mundo went out of his way to cheer her up by visiting her — food in tow — after she underwent surgery.


“I feel like he was always prepared,” says Castillo. “He had his plan together, he knew what he wanted to do and he was simply that kid who had his life together.”


Students shared memories of Mundo on a mural provided by La Casa and signed a soccer ball — in honor of the sport Mundo adored — to give to Mundo’s family.


“You hear and read in the paper that people said he was a nice guy. (He) was one of the better ones,” says LaMalfa. “He had a very happy life and people loved him.”


Victoria Mundo, his sister, says the family is grateful for the support and love they’ve received. And stories shared about Mundo on his memorial Facebook page, she says, have provided additional comfort.


The Mundo family also created a 
 to raise funds for various service , burial and other costs. An additional memorial service will be held for Mundo Feb. 7 at his former high school in Chicago.


 


The search for Christian Zamora continues

Zamora, a U. of Illinois graduate, was reported missing Dec. 31.


Champaign police say he was last seen walking to a grocery store on campus by friends. But when Zamora did not show up to his Jan. 2 work shift at Jimmy John’s, his mother filed a missing persons report.


Zamora has brown hair, brown eyes, is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs approximately 150 pounds.


The search for him is ongoing, police say.


If you have any information related to Zamora’s disappearance, call the 
 at (217) 351-4545.
