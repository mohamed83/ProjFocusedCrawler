Sometimes reading stinks.


Throughout life as an 
, I’ve personally had to read an Old English text about 
, several essays regarding the physics of the brain, and a piece by
someone who is considered to be
.


There is only so much that skimming and SparkNotes can do when dealing with works like these, and watching paint dry sounds like a more exciting activity at times. However, not all reading has to be boring or tedious.


Here is a list of simple, short books for lazy college students to enjoy in their spare time:


Animal Farm
 by George Orwell (176 pages)


Anybody interested in 20th century history will love this book. The novel acts out the rise of the Soviet Union through the metaphor of animals revolting on a farm, and only requires a basic understanding of Russia to comprehend. 
Animal Farm
 is written simply and plainly, so you will not have to go back and forth with your dictionary after every page. Without the distraction of ornate language, you will have more time to focus on the symbolism Orwell convey


The Old Man and the Sea
 by Ernest Hemingway (127 pages)


This 20th century classic is all about an old Cuban fisherman and his quest to catch one more big fish before he dies. Hemingway, who is famous for being a minimalist author, uses language that a third grader could easily understand. The story hides deep and symbolic meaning between the lines, which makes for a great brain exercise.


The Great Gatsby
 by F. Scott Fitzgerald (180 pages) 


If you never had to read this for high school, you’ve missed out. This legendary story accounts for a wealthy man who has everything but the woman of his dreams, and attempts to tear apart the differences between lust and love. The language is a bit harder to comprehend since it includes a fair amount of 1920s colloquialisms, but is still really easy to understand as a whole. With two movie adaptions, it is easy to see that 
The Great Gatsby
 has stood the test of time in American culture.


Of Mice and Men
 by John Steinbeck (107 pages) 


Technically a novella, this remarkably short book deals with hardships that take place when trying to accomplish dreams. Set during the Great Depression, 
Of Mice and Men
 is one of those quick reads that teaches you life lessons with real world application. It can be read in one sitting, making it a tempting choice for even the busiest students.


Bonus: Knock by Fredric Brown (17 words)


Commonly referred to as the world’s shortest sci-fi story, “Knock” offers a chilling and mysterious tale in a mere two sentences. You can read it 
.


Jay Tellini is currently pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree at Rutgers University as an English major. He has a passion for creative writing, and is entertained by anything shiny. He’s the kind of guy who many people do not expect to be a practical joker, but proves those people wrong after a pie in the face and several Nerf bullets to the chest. Jay enjoys playing guitar and claims to have invented the Pythagorean Theorem (I had the idea before I knew who Pythagoras was). Favorite quote: “Combine pancake mix, water and peanut butter; mix according to package directions” – Aunt Jemima.
