This weekend, St. Louis hosted “
,” a four-day period of resistance and the start of a broader campaign to address systemic oppression of communities of color. 
, a coalition of local organizations, issued a 
 on Oct. 1, asking volunteers to travel to Ferguson and show their solidarity.


More than 
 domestic and international supporters answered the call.


Paris Akins was one of them.


A sophomore urban ministries major at 
 in Chicago, Akins attended Saturday’s mile-long 
.


“As everyone was gathering, you got a sense of community,” she said. “The churches were singing gospel songs to the tune of ‘This Little Light of Mine,’ but they changed some of the words to ‘Ferguson’ and ‘Michael Brown.’ There were chants going on that groups would start. Then, we started going up the street to start the march.”

Akins says the most sobering moments of the march were the

 display of Michael Brown with his hands up and the speeches given by the bereaved.


She says the atmosphere at the march differed from mainstream media accounts.


“I don’t feel like they’re capturing what I saw,” Akins, who identifies as white, said. “I saw people heartbroken. They’re just mourning Michael Brown’s death and the other teen (
), who was shot by an off-duty cop. There was anger – but it was, like, a righteous anger. I didn’t feel afraid that they were going to get out of control. I felt like they were channeling that anger for change.”

For communities of color, change means dismantling the false, post-racial America narrative.

“You’re taught that racism ended with the Civil Rights Movement, but it didn’t end there,” Akins said. “It didn’t die. It took on a new form with the 
. A lot of people don’t understand the history. They don’t understand why African-Americans are so angry. They aren’t willing to listen to their stories.”


Yet back on campus, Akins is ensuring those stories are amplified. At the march, Akins was given a sign, which said, “Stop mass incarceration and police brutality.” For the rest of the month, she and a group of students will alternate carrying the sign around campus to raise awareness about the movement brewing in Ferguson.


“I think it’s important for people to realize that there’s stuff they can do at their schools or in their communities,” she said.


Naomi Brown shares Akins’ sentiments.


A fourth-year political science major at 
 in Tallahassee, Fla., Brown works with the 
 of 
. She says she jumped at the opportunity to go to Ferguson this weekend.


Of the actions she participated in, Brown says she was most shaken by the late-night march on Saturday, which began in Ferguson, moved to Shaw – the scene of the Myers’ shooting – and ended early Sunday with the occupation of a 
.


While police remained peaceful during daytime demonstrations, Brown says they became aggressive at night when fewer cameras were present.


“They actually dropped tear gas [on us],” Brown said. “I got tear-gassed. My friend, Katie, got maced. They were shoving us around. One of the cops was poking me with his baton and shoving me off the sidewalk.”


Brown, who identifies as black, maintains that the protesters were peaceful and says the desensitization to aggressive policing of minorities was problematic.

“It’s indicative of larger systemic issues because of how normal people see it as,” she said.


Nia Morgan, a junior psychology and sociology major at 
 in St. Louis, said she believed it was not so much that people viewed incidents of police brutality as normal, but rather, unrelated.


“So, many people think this is just isolated,” said Morgan, who is a member of 
, a multicultural, student network, which campaigns against 
.


“Now’s the time when we need to start educating them that these are not isolated incidents,” she said. “These are things that happen 
.”


Steve Moody, a sophomore political science major at City Colleges of Chicago, agrees.


“It’s not something independent to Ferguson,” said Moody, who attended Saturday’s late-night march as well as the 
 concert on Sunday.


“It’s not something independent to Chicago. It’s not something independent to New York. It’s a national problem.”


Moody, who identifies as black, says one of the biggest issues with conversations about police brutality was the black-on-black crime rebuttal – an argument which overlooks 
 across the board, erases simultaneous 
 by African Americans to tackle intra-racial violence and ignores the lack of accountability for law enforcement.


“It’s a complete derailment,” he said. “There’s a difference between crime and state-sanctioned murder.”


Moody said Ferguson October was partially about challenging that difference.


“[We are] letting the police know you’re going to be held accountable for this.”

But local organizers aren’t stopping there. Ashley Yates, a Florissant, Mo. native and co-founder of 
, explained that organizers in Ferguson were examining any systemic issue that targets communities of color – from policing systems to housing to education. She says this past weekend was intended to reenergize that campaign.


“One of the specific goals was to just kind of show that this has not died down and not only has it not died down, but people around the world, around the nation, have paid attention,” Yates said. “And when there’s a call for bodies, people actually respond to that because they are so committed to this.”


Yates also says that the acts of civil disobedience were strategic.


“This is no longer a reactionary movement,” she said. “It was in the early days… but it has really shifted and I thought we saw that highlighted in Ferguson October.”


And the movement will not stop, Yates says.


“There is an insanity in this country and that insanity is racism, and a lot of people aren’t even seeing it,” she said. “We’re taking it into the neighborhoods that are trying to sequester themselves off and act as though black people don’t stand beside them and work beside them and live beside them each and every day and really showing them that black lives do matter. We exist. We’re human just like anyone else.”


“I grieve, I live, I dream just like you,” she said.
