President Obama’s 
 address was the most digitally enhanced address to date, with 2.6 million tweets using #SOTU. Whitehouse.gov was live tweeting the event with graphics and data that backed up Obama’s statements.

The president stressed the importance of his 
. This plan would make the first two years of community college completely free through funding from the federal government and individual states.


Critics are concerned that this would benefit the middle class and wealthy students more than the poor, since low-income students are able to pay for school via Pell Grants.


WATCH: 


The Obama administration points out that many low-income students are not aware that they are able to receive Pell Grants, which can discourage these students from pursuing a college degree.


It is unclear whether or not this proposal has a fighting chance with a Republican-controlled  Congress, but Obama is hopeful that community college can become an extension of high school before he leaves the White House.
