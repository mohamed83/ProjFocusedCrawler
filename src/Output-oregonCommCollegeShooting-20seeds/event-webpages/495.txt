Georgia bill would lower tuition, increase college access for undocumented students

Since enrolling at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UI) in the fall, Omar Cruz’s life has changed dramatically.


“Even though it’s only been a semester, I’ve changed a whole lot due to the university,” he says. “I don’t have to go out of my way as much to look for opportunities here on campus.”


Cruz, a sophomore at UI and an undocumented student, moved from Mexico to the U.S. with his father in 2001. He grew up in a Hispanic neighborhood of Chicago and went to a high-achieving high school where he earned good grades. But in some states, that still isn’t enough to go to college.


, undocumented individuals are not permitted to attend large, competitive public universities like the University of Georgia (UGA) or Georgia Tech. They can instead apply to colleges that have spots left after their regular applicant pool has been chosen. 


And they must pay expensive out-of-state tuition rates in order to attend.


Even with in-state tuition, Cruz’s family couldn’t afford to send him to college until a year after he graduated high school. With help from a family friend, he enrolled at UI, where he studies food engineering and pays an in-state bill just like any other Illinois resident would — thanks to the state’s relatively lax educational regulations for immigrants.


“My experience has been great,” he says. “People are so welcoming. They have open arms; they basically don’t judge you whether you’re undocumented or not.”


For undocumented prospective college students in Georgia, Cruz’s success story is still out of reach. 


However, that may be about to change.


Sen. Nan Orrock is sponsoring a bill that would allow people who legally live in Georgia under the Obama Administration’s 
 to pay in-state tuition to attend public universities with open admission spots. 


If passed, Orrock says SB 44 would increase access to higher education for the roughly 19,000 immigrants with DACA status that live in the state, as they would not have to pay out-of-state tuition rates, which can be up to three times as much as in-state tuition. With less incentive to go out of state, those students could be key contributors to growing Georgia’s economy.


“By barring in-state tuition to these students, we are reducing the number of capable, qualified people that could earn degrees and contribute to our economy and help build our state,” Orrock says. “That’s what’s missing when you stand in the college door and deny these people access by charging outlandishly high tuition.” 


, there are as many as 1.4 million undocumented students in the U.S., but 49% of them will drop out sometime during high school, as compared with merely 11% of their documented peers. 


Having grown up in Athens, Ga., Anise Crane, a junior at UGA and a member of the Undocumented Student Alliance, witnessed this reality first hand.

“Something that I saw a lot with high school students is that — when you grow up knowing you’re undocumented your whole life, knowing that the ban is there, knowing that you can’t get in-state tuition — I think it discourages a lot of people from even trying from a certain extent just because they’re like ‘What’s it going to do for me anyways?’” she says.


The Golden Door Scholars additionally 
 that only 5-10% of undocumented high school graduates in the U.S. continue their education in college. 


The result is a pretty substantial waste of taxpayer money, Orrock says.


“Our state is investing about $110,000 on each student [during their public education], and then we throw up a barrier and charge tuition that’s too high for the average family to pay for the non-citizen applicants who are qualified in every way to be admitted to a college in Georgia,” she says.


Beyond broad economic benefits, Romik Srivastava, a senior and Undocumented Student Alliance member at UGA, says several of the undocumented students he knows feel that staying close to home so important they would never go out of state for college.


“Because [undocumented students] have this ban and out-of-state tuition, they don’t feel welcome both in Georgia and at Georgia schools — even though this is where they’ve grown up,” he says. “This bill would be a first step toward them feeling like they’re actually at home, which every student should feel like.”


Some observers 
 since a small but vocal anti-immigrant Republican faction occupies both the Georgia House of Representatives and Senate. 


Srivastava says eventually the law will have to change, even if it doesn’t this term. 


“Historically, this is how progress works,” he says. “You have to make enough noise for everyone to hear it to get behind the cause. And there’s a lot of people making noise in a lot of different places.”


Last month, members of the Undocumented Student Alliance coordinated a 
 in protest of the state policy that prohibits undocumented students from enrolling at large public research universities in Georgia. 


During the demonstration, police arrested nine students from various state universities, including 
, which provides alternative higher education for non-citizens in the state. Although 
 have brought attention to the issue, no major legislation has been passed in favor of extending educational opportunities to undocumented students on the state level.


Ultimately, Georgia lawmakers may not even vote on the issue this legislative term, but in the meantime, Cruz says there is one key thing that all undocumented students who are struggling to find a way to get into college should have: persistence.


“There’s always a way,” he says. “Honestly I kept just looking for a way to come here. It’s going to be difficult — because it was for me — but at the end of the day you’re always going to end up finding a way to get in.”
