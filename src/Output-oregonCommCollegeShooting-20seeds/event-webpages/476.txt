“Experience a plus,” is a familiar phrase you will see when looking for internships or jobs.


When I first moved to the United States for college, I was confused by this. Where do I get this “experience” that will make me stand out from the pile of students applying for the same internship?


Believe it or not, the best and easiest place to get experience is right on your campus! It’s never too early to start career prep and there are so many opportunities on campus to do so.


1. Get Involved


There are so many clubs and organization on campus so it shouldn’t be hard to find something that you are interested in. If you can’t find something, start something!


I know most schools make it fairly easy for students to start clubs and organizations. Interested in finance? Work your way to being the treasurer of your favorite club. Want to get into journalism? Join the school newspaper.


There are so many skills you can learn just from getting involved on campus, it’s all about being able to articulate them on your resume and in your interview. For example, I was an orientation leader for 2 years and just from that on-campus involvement, I can say I have learnt crisis management, communication skills and a little insight into the world of student affairs.


2. Get an on-campus job


On campus jobs are a great way to make some extra money, gain some experience and build connections to faculty and staff that can be valuable references when you start internship and job hunting. With the added advantage of not having to leave school to go to work, you will easily be able to build a schedule that allows you to do all you need to do.


From being a resident assistant to working in the library to campus security or working with the schools IT department, there are countless opportunities to build your resume on campus. Find a job that closely mirrors your career goals and start building a repertoire of skills and tools for the future.


You may even be able to find a mentor in whoever your supervisor is and be able to speak to them more about what working in that field is like.


3. Volunteer


Volunteering is a great way to not only give back to your community. Organizations are always looking for volunteers and there are so many skills you can learn that can be applied to any future internships. In addition to career-specific tools, communication skills, teamwork, customer service and project management are some of the skills you can look forward to putting under your belt.


With the wealth of career enrichment opportunities available on campus, you will be well on your way to leveling up from campus to career in no time!


Don’t forget to visit your campus career center for assistance on how to include these experiences on your resume and leverage them to get that internship you want.
