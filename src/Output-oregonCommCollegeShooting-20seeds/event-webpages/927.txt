Classes are canceled Tuesday and a vigil is scheduled at Delta State University after a geography teacher’s shooting spree left three people dead, including an assistant history professor.


Shannon Lamb, 45, apparently shot his live-in girlfriend in Gautier, Miss., early Monday, then drove 300 miles before confronting and killing Ethan Schmidt in his Delta State office, reports 


Lamb was then seen driving through Greenville, Miss., where officers tried to pull him over. According to the report, Lamb got out of the vehicle and fled on foot. “Police heard a shot and shortly thereafter found Lamb with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, Cleveland Police Chief Charles Bingham said.”


Earlier on Monday, it was reported that the campus was on lockdown, SWAT teams searched the grounds and helicopters were overhead. All schools in Cleveland were on lockdown as well.

Michelle Roberts, vice president of university relations, called the events “tragic,” and said in a statement that “the entire campus sends its heartfelt thoughts and sympathy to Professor Schmidt’s family.”


“We are grieving on this campus with this loss,” Roberts said.


On its website, Delta State, which has approximately 3,300 students, said that while classes are canceled, campus offices are open. Counseling services are available as well, including in residence halls.
