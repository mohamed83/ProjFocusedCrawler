Have you ever wished that you could test drive a college or university before deciding which school to attend?


If so, here’s some great news — you can! A growing number of colleges now offer shadowing programs, which allow high school students to spend a day (or several days) in the life of a current college student. This student ambassador can become your personal guide to the campus and your experience with him or her can help to inform your final college decision.


Read on to learn about four reasons to shadow a current college student:


1. You can gain a sense of college life


No matter where you ultimately go to college, participating in a shadowing program can help you prepare for college life. The flexibility of higher education is very different from the more structured routine of high school, and it can take some time to fully adjust to this new reality.


RELATED: 


Though one shadowing experience won’t fully acclimate you to college life, shadowing a student ambassador can introduce you to what it is like to be a university student. You will gain first-hand experience in moving from class to class, often with varying periods of unstructured time in between. You will also begin to develop a sense of your responsibilities and requirements as a college student, which will allow you to mentally prepare for this impending academic and lifestyle change.


2. You can experience college academics


As mentioned above, the average shadowing experience includes the opportunity to sit in on a course or two. This effectively enables you to see what college classes are like before you enroll in them for the first time.


Some college shadowing programs will even pair you with a student ambassador who is studying in your intended field or major. This means that you will likely experience the exact same courses that you will need to take during your college career. Come your first day of classes, you’ll have a better sense of what to expect, and you can thus prepare in advance.


3. You can familiarize yourself with the campus


Even if you have your heart set on a specific school, it’s still wise to participate in a shadowing program at that institution. Doing so can help you get to know your future campus. Pick up a campus map from the admissions office or find one online, and begin familiarizing yourself with it before your shadowing day.


RELATED: 


While on campus, use your phone or camera to take photographs of different landmarks. Having handy visual references of key campus features (such as unique buildings, fountains and sculptures) can help you navigate on your first day of classes.


4. You can learn information that brochures and websites don’t offer


The “insider” knowledge that you’ll gain from shadowing a current college student is extremely valuable. Your student ambassador may tell you about the best places to relax and socialize on campus, the best dining halls to eat in, or the quietest study spots. Be sure to ask questions and take notes on any information or suggestions that your student ambassador offers.
