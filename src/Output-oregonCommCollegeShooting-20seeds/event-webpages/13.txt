ROSEBURG, OR (KPTV) -
            
Nine people were killed and at least seven others were injured by a gunman in a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in the Roseburg area Thursday morning.
The shooter is also dead, according to the FBI. CNN identified the shooter 
. 
Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said the ten total people confirmed dead is the most accurate information investigators had Thursday evening.
The Oregon Attorney General previously reported 13 people died in the shooting. 
The Douglas County Sheriff's Office said the 911 center received reports of an active shooter around 10:38 a.m.
Upon arriving on campus, law enforcement found the suspect in one of the buildings and exchanged gunfire.
An Oregon State Police spokesman told CNN earlier more than were 20 wounded. Hospitals as far away as Eugene were preparing to take patients.
The Douglas County Sheriff's Office said no law enforcement officers were injured.
The FBI was sending agents from several offices around the state to Roseburg, and the ATF said it was sending additional units from Portland and a K-9 team to assist in the investigation.
The Douglas County Sheriff's Office said it's still a very active investigation on campus. 
An 18-year-old student at Umpqua Community College told 
that a shot went through the window of her writing class and the gunman came in and told people to get on the ground.
The student told The News-Review that the man then told people to state their religion before he opened fire. 
Roseburg residents reacted to the shooting with shock.
"This is why we live in a place like this, to stay away from this stuff," said Steven Agee, owner of Totem Market near the college. 
"This is a small community," Brandi Smith told FOX 12 from Roseburg. "Everyone knows someone who goes to UCC." 
In a televised address Thursday afternoon, President Barack Obama 
 and called for tougher gun control measures, saying "our thoughts and prayers are not enough" to prevent similar acts of violence.
Umpqua Community College is located on about 100 acres next to the Umpqua River. It had about 13,600 students in the 2013-2014 school year.
Interim UCC President Rita Cavan said the campus would be closed Friday and any student activities scheduled for the weekend would be canceled. Cavan said the college planned to resume classes on Monday.
The FBI established a number for tips, information and details for families in connection to the shooting, 1-800-225-5324, option 7.
