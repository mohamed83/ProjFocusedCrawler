GRANVILLE, Ohio- Denison University has canceled classes for today  after a missing student was found dead.


The university confirmed that Wendell Jackson was found Tuesday morning in the college’s Biological Reserve.


Ginny Sharkey, a university spokeswoman, said 


Sharkey said Jackson was a college junior from the Chicago area.


The following statement was released on Denison’s website, 
“We are all incredibly saddened by Wendell’s tragic death. He was a bright, active and engaged person. A Resident Assistant who touched many lives, an admissions host who introduced future students to Denison, a graduate of the LeaderShape program — a student we were all proud to call a Denisonian.”


Swasey Chapel will be open throughout the day for students, faculty and staff to congregate and share memories of Wendell.
