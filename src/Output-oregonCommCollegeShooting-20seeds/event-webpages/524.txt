As South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley 
 of the Confederate flag, many Southern college students say there are other ways to celebrate Southern heritage.


“The flag has had so many different meanings throughout history and the one it holds today is what’s important — and that’s racism,” Sammi Rushing, a junior at Louisiana State University, says. “There is a racial divide in America. Anything that we’re doing to promote the divide, whether you agree with it or not, is unacceptable.”


Spencer Scruggs, a graduate student at Florida State University, says that the Confederate flag was the 
 of Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia, but “somehow people grasped onto it as the flag of the Confederacy.”


Historically, the flag came to be associated with the 
, which seceded from the Union during the Civil War. In post-Civil War America, the flag was generally perceived as 
 for white supremacist groups and the Ku Klux Klan. Now, Scruggs says it’s an offensive symbol that he doesn’t want flying at all.


“The problem I find with the Confederate flag is that it in no way represents what the South actually is,” he says. “It represents an antiquated ideal about the South that is very damaging to Southerners and our culture.”


The recent debate over the Confederate flag comes on the heels of last week’s racially motivated mass murder during which nine people were fatally shot at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. After photos surfaced of 21-year-old gunman, Dylann Roof, waving the Confederate flag, the discussion then turned to the racial message conveyed by the flag’s presence.

 clear, stating he thinks the flag “belongs in a museum.” But the decision to fly the Confederate flag is left at the state level. Following the shooting, 
 plans to propose a bill to remove the flag from the statehouse in Columbia.


Politicians weren’t the only ones calling for the removal of the flag. 
, 
 announced that they would remove items relating to the flag from its shelves.


Jack Sibilsky, a senior at Texas Tech University, agrees with South Carolina politicians, saying the flag shouldn’t be flown in the capitol.


“I don’t think it should be flown on public grounds,” he says. “Race is a big issue in South Carolina and in the country. In public places where it is supposed to represent everyone it shouldn’t fly because it’s about bigotry and hatred.”


While students noted that the flag can be seen or argued as a symbol of Southern heritage, they say there are better and less offensive ways of doing so.


“I understand that it’s historical and a memorial to Confederate soldiers,” Silbilsky says. “People are relatives of those soldiers and it’s their heritage and way of remembrance, so that shouldn’t be disregarded. But it still shouldn’t fly in any public areas.”


Scruggs says hallmarks like music, food and literature are the best ways to celebrate Southern culture, but sees why people cling to the Confederate flag.


“I think the reason people latch onto the flag is that in some ways Southern heritage has been demonized because of the past with slavery,” he says. “So, the flag is something tangible they can hold onto. The difficult part is moving past that because there are different things that make the South rich and cultured. Clinging onto the flag almost negates those aspects.”


In an OpEd for the
, Byron Thomas, a black student at the University of South Carolina, wrote that he hangs the Confederate flag with pride.


“One of my ancestors, Benjamin Thomas, was a black Confederate cook, and I do not want to turn my back on his service to the South,” he said. “So, I hang the flag in honor of his hard work and dedication to South Carolina during the Civil War.”


But Thomas writes in the OpEd that despite his pride in hanging the flag, he understands not wanting the flag to fly. Thomas says he loves his state and its citizens, but recognizes the flag flying could incite protests and offend others.


Still, Rushing says the South could take pride in many things but the promotion of a historically racist artifact should not be one of them.
