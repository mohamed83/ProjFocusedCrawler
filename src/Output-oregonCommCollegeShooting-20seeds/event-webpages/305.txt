Living with student loan debt may seem inevitable for a lot of college grads. Annual student borrowing has tripled in the past 30 years: The average student took out $2,485 in loans a year in 1990-91, compared to $6,928 a year in 2012-13, according to the 
.


But what if your city or town helped you pay for college, or even helped pay off your student loans after you graduated? Cities across the country have started programs to cut down on students’ and graduates’ college costs, encouraging higher graduation rates and more investment in local communities.


Here’s a sampling of the programs that are out there and what you’ll need to keep in mind if you participate.


Places that help you pay off your student loans


It’s easy to get frustrated if you have a lot of expenses and making the minimum payment on your 
 barely seems to lower your balance. If you’re looking for a solution, how does moving to rural Kansas sound?


RELATED: 


Kansas 
 are counties that will repay part of your student loan balance if you move there. You’d be eligible for payment of 20% of your student loan balance, up to $3,000 annually for a maximum of five years, or $15,000 total.


To participate, you have to complete an application that shows you have at least an associate’s degree and that your student loans are in good standing. With a mix of state and county funds, your student loan servicer would get a lump-sum payment every September or October to put toward your balance, and you’d be required to pay taxes on each payment.


Since the initiative started in 2011, about 2,500 people from 42 states have applied so far, says Chris Harris, who manages the program for the Kansas Department of Commerce. More than 70% of applicants end up completing the process, he says.


“It was really built off a need to find something compelling to a younger demographic to get them interested in moving to a rural community,” Harris says.


The program also includes income-tax waivers for new residents, but almost 90% of program applicants surveyed said student loan repayment assistance was an important factor in their decision to apply, he says.


RELATED:  


“The lack of a national solution on the issue or the lack of any consensus on what to do about it has played to our advantage,” Harris says.


The city of Niagara Falls, N.Y., also offers student loan repayment assistance. The 
 program will give recent grads up to $6,984 total to pay toward their loan balances if they agree to live in downtown Niagara Falls for at least two years. Like rural communities in Kansas, Niagara Falls has been losing residents: The city’s population of 50,193 in 2010 was less than half its peak in 1960, according to the 
.


Both programs aim to entice young people who will invest their money and energy into the local economies. And because a high debt-to-income ratio affects graduates’ ability to qualify for a mortgage and to plan for retirement, the 
 has warned, minimizing student loan debt could make young people more likely to start businesses or to buy homes in those areas.


Places that help you pay for college


Residents of some cities have the opportunity to avoid student loan debt altogether. 
 started 10 years ago when anonymous donors pledged to donate enough money to send every graduating high school senior from Kalamazoo, Mich. public schools to college — for free.


If you’re a Kalamazoo resident and you’ve gone to city public schools from kindergarten through 12th grade, you’ll get a free ride to an in-state college in Michigan. Funding is administered based on 
 you attended Kalamazoo public schools; students who went for 9th through 12th grades only, for instance, get 65% of their college costs covered. If you attended starting in grades 10 through 12, you’re not eligible.


And it’s working. Students who participated in Kalamazoo Promise were about 30%  more likely to graduate from college than students who did not participate, according to a 
 by the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. The program’s success has inspired a host of similar initiatives . Nine Michigan communities have designated themselves Promise Zones , which also funnel private donations to seniors who graduated from area public schools, regardless of high school GPA.


Altogether, more than 30 communities  across the country have developed programs modeled on Kalamazoo’s since 2005. 
 in Arkansas, for instance, is funded by Murphy Oil Corp., which pays for the city’s public high school graduates to go to any college, in or out of state. The program will give students an annual subsidy up to the cost of Arkansas public, in-state tuition. In 2007, the first year of the program, 76% of El Dorado students enrolled in college, compared to 60% the year before.


The idea is gaining strength on a larger scale, too. 
, a state program that goes into effect this fall, provides full tuition and fees for community college students in Tennessee who don’t qualify for federal Pell grants or state-based aid. About 58,000 graduating seniors in Tennessee have applied  for the program, almost double the state’s expectations. Oregon 
 in July implementing a similar program, which will go into effect for the 2016-17 school year. And President Barack Obama has proposed taking the idea to a national level with 
, which would waive two years of tuition for community college students who are in school at least half time and maintain a 2.5 GPA or higher. It hasn’t yet made it to a vote in Congress.


Understanding the fine print


If you’re interested in taking part in one of these programs, make sure you’re familiar with the specific terms and requirements before you apply. You may know what to expect if you participate in a Kalamazoo Promise-type program in your hometown, but moving to a new place to help repay your student loans could bring major lifestyle changes.


“There are things that you come to expect in an urban area that you just won’t have in a rural area,” says Harris of the Kansas Department of Commerce.


Look into any tax implications, and make sure you understand how a lump-sum student loan reimbursement may affect your loan repayment options.


That’s especially important if you’re on an income-based repayment plan or are participating in the 
 program, says Persis Yu, a staff attorney for the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project at the National Consumer Law Center.


“I certainly understand struggling communities doing whatever they need to to get more professionals and more younger people living there,” she says. “The details are going to be very important for people to consider.”
