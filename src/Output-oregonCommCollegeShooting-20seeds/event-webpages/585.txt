College is a major investment and it will impact your life long after you walk across the stage and receive your diploma. It’s thus no surprise that finding the right college can be a stressful experience.


Yes, most want a school that boasts a strong reputation to gain a boost when entering the job market, but there’s much more to college selection than that. Enrolling in a college that matches your personality can help you save time and money while maximizing the college experience — not only preparing for your career but building skills and fond memories that will last a lifetime.


 


Here are six tips to help you find a college that perfectly fits your personality and goals.


1. Know Thyself


Maybe you’ve always dreamed of escaping your small town and attending college in a big city or maybe you’ve always imagined yourself getting away from the big city and going to school in a small “college town.” Going to school in an environment different from where you grew up can be a great way to expand your horizons.


Change can be difficult, though. If you’re used to wide open spaces, cramped subways and crowded streets can be stressful. College towns are quaint, but they can also seem a little boring if you’re used to the excitement of the city. And size/location is just one dimension of the college experience. To find your best fit, know what 
you
 want in a school right now (not what you used to want or others told you to want), why you want it and what your options are.


2. Visit campuses in person


Even if the colleges that particularly interest you are far away and visiting is not feasible, take time to visit local colleges. You’ll likely find a variety of campuses within driving distance where you can complete a campus tour.


RELATED: 


Strive to experience the different atmospheres at state, private and liberal arts colleges to gain an idea of the type of college you’d like the best. Of course, whenever possible, visit the actual schools to which you plan to apply since there’s no substitute for firsthand impressions.


3. Talk to current students


Get in contact with current students at schools that interest you. There’s much more to college life than what is on the school’s website. Ask about events and activities at the school. Ask about professors and, if possible, talk to them as well. Does the school have a good program for the major(s) that interest you?


RELATED: 


Also, don’t rely on one opinion. Take the time to reach out to different students to get diverse perspectives.


4. Realize that numbers and catalogs can – 
ahem
 – bend the truth a little


Numbers like student-to-faculty ratio and publications like course catalogs can be useful when seeking general information about a college or university. But, as mentioned earlier, there’s no substitute for actual, firsthand experience.


Visit campuses and even courses to get your own sense of what schools are like. Talk to real students and ask if — despite attractive student-to-faculty ratios — you’ll spend your freshman year in classes of 60 or more students. The courses that you like in the catalog may only be offered once a year or even once every two years and could have very limited spots. Asking questions about the realities of the college experience will help you dig beyond superficial statistics and best-case claims.


5. Explore traditional, online and mixed programs


Going to college for four school years and living on or near campus isn’t the right choice for everybody. Fortunately, that’s not the only option available to you. Even if you’re pretty sure that you want to take the traditional route, exploring options can give you confidence that you’ve made the right decision. Also, if you’re concerned that enrolling at an online school is not a match for your personality, you might still be interested in a mixed program that includes some online class options.


RELATED: 


In general, don’t make assumptions. Take time to learn about the options out there.


6. Trust that there is a college for you


With massively diverse colleges and programs available, know that there is one out there that matches 
your
 unique personality and 
your
 individual goals for your college career. Understandably, spending time poring over college after college can seem a little tedious. But remember that the investment you make now will pay off by helping to make your college experience more than just vocational training. Instead, it can mean making lifelong friendships and building a solid foundation for your future both professionally and personally.
