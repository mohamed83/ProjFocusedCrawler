, presented by the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society.

Quan Nguyen can be described as a hard-worker and exceptional student, but his successes extend far beyond the classroom.


Moving from Vietnam to America in 2010 was the start of an educational journey for Nguyen, who initially took a gap year to work two full-time jobs to establish a life for his mother and himself before beginning his studies at Bunker Hill Community College (BHCC) in Boston, MA.


“Before coming to America, I planned to become a pharmacist; however, my plans changed significantly when my father was diagnosed with Hepatitis C,” he says.


In Vietnam, herbal remedies are more commonly used as opposed to Western medicines. He soon learned from a pharmacist in the family that the coating of the medicines lessen the potency, thus affecting how they treat illnesses.


As his father’s health worsened, Nguyen decided that he wanted to become a materials scientist to research more effective drug delivery methods, which inspired his desire to attend Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for its biomedical engineering program.


After spending time working full-time and learning english, Nguyen attended BHCC for to its “affordable tuition, accessible location, and generous financial aid.”


Community college would serve as a stepping stone in Nguyen’s plan to become an ideal applicant for the MIT program.

“Because BHCC had a reputation for helping people from different backgrounds and languages, I felt this was the right place to start my collegiate journey,” he says.


Although being a first-generation college student presented its struggles of not having parental advice or a lens into the professional world, Nguyen’s used what some may see as a disadvantage to his upper hand.


“I have seen other first-generation students more likely to be behind academically,” he says. “These thoughts motivated me to overcome my hardships and helped me succeed in my educational journey.”


Small class sizes and the utmost dedication from faculty and staff contributed to Nguyen’s positive experience at BHCC. He recalls that his professors understood his language and cultural differences and their empathy gave him “the confidence to venture onward.”


“Because of its focus on teaching, BHCC taught me to be a learner,” he says. “Now, I can use that foundation to rise to more in-depth studies as a researcher at an advanced institution.”


During his time at community college he joined various clubs, became a student leader, attended workshops and presented at a regional conference.


“Forging connections among students at BHCC seemed to be easier thanks to its impressive level of diversity,” he says.


To further his education outside of the classroom, he worked as a research intern at Vertex Pharmaceuticals Company where he gained experience in an industrial environment. From the internship and his studies, Nguyen sought to learn how to run his own biomaterials company — something he hopes to accomplish in the future.


This spring, Nguyen achieved the goal he had when he first came to America: he was accepted as a transfer student to MIT — along with being offered a full scholarship. He is majoring in chemical-biological engineering and pursuing a minor in biomedical and materials science. He has received praise from BHCC faculty and administration for his achievements.


After attaining his degree, he hopes to obtain his PhD from MIT and start his own research and distribution firm for medical devices. Later, he intends to spend more time volunteering at 
 to help high school students avoid gang life and “overcome educational barriers,” as well as help others who are transitioning into the United States.


He remembers that his family’s lack of information upon moving to the United States resulted in the loss of thousands of dollars to seek legal counsel on various tasks, such as finding a place to live and accessing health care. He hopes to help those who are moving to get connected with specific programs for a smoother and more viable transition.


His educational experience at BHCC served as a catalyst for his lifelong goals.


“BHCC gave me an exceptional experience that helped me discover who I am and develop the confidence to believe in my own success,” she says. “It opened my heart and taught me that I did not have to do great things, just small things with great love.”


 is a student at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and a spring 2015 USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent.
