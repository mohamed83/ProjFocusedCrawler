Throughout high school, it seems that everyone wants to bestow the same warnings about college. Based solely off of these clichés, college sounds like the most terrifying place on earth. Fortunately, a lot of the warnings you’ve heard can be debunked.


Here are five things you’ve been told about college that you should take with a grain of salt.


1. The Freshman 15


There is some validity to this particular myth because when you go off to school, your schedule and living arrangements will likely change your diet and exercise.


However, the legend of the fateful ‘Freshman 15’ is just an adage to justify collegiate weight gain, even though I’ve seen far more people get to college and get in better shape with the help of the college gym and the constant bustling around campus. Don’t fall prey to your new found lifestyle, find a yoga group or intramural sports team to help fight that freshy fat.


2. Finals week will kill you


Finals are hard; finals week really isn’t. The myth of finals week being one long cram session is only true of people who didn’t really give it the old college try for the semester leading up to that point.


RELATED: 


If you’ve not been present (mentally or physically) in class most of the semester, then you will likely make yourself crazy trying to shove enough information from your text book in a week as you can. This is not only the least effective mean of studying, but also the most stressful. However, most of us will use the semester’s work and the week before finals to smoothly obtain the information necessary for out tests. There may be a few hours of binge studying for some tests, but overall, those who study prior to the last week get to sit back and enjoy the easier schedule of finals week.


3. Your school is a party school.


News flash: 
every 
school is a party school. This one is simple; whether you go to a school of 24,000 or 2,400, in a big city or a small town, there will be parties.


Similarly, every school has a library and extra-curricular activities, so it’s just as easy to invest your time in something else if that’s what you’d rather do. Don’t let the legend of wild parties attract or repel you. There is no inevitable partying, the amount of party in your school is solely reliant on how you spend your time.


4. You can’t be social and do well in school


Actually, you can. Realistically, even the most studious people don’t spend their whole day in the library, so you can certainly find time for both. Though you’ll have to prioritize sometimes and might consequently miss a party or two, overall balancing your social life, studies, extra curricular activities and even a job is manageable, if you actually manage it. Invest in a calendar and strive for moderation and you should be fine


5. I’ve been there


This one’s the most important one. Just because someone has been to college, or even your college, doesn’t mean they know what it’s going to be like for you. Some people will try to prepare you and get you through the experience of college before you ever get there.


RELATED: 


Though it’s given with good intentions, the advice you get about college before you get to college is not to be taken as fact. Your experience will be different than your mother’s, your brother’s, your best friend’s or even the guy sitting next to you at orientation. The best advice about going into college is to avoid getting caught up in all of the advice about college.
