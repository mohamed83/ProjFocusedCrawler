Clark Atlanta University mourns the loss of James Jones Jr., a 21-year-old student with a bright future, who was murdered while trying to purchase an iPhone off Craigslist. Police report that Jones was robbed and shot by the suspects who also posted the ad. Police in the Atlanta metro area have begun to offer their parking lots as “Transaction Safe Zones” to help prevent crimes such as this that stem from buy and sell sites like Craigslist.


Are the police offering “Transaction Safe Zones” in your area? If so tweet us 
 and help spread the word to keep our fellow students, friends, families, and loved ones safe.
