KUSA — On Colorado college campuses, some military veterans say they are going without textbooks because of delays in processing VA education benefit claims.


Navy veteran Rich Slawinski is studying for a MBA at the University of Colorado Denver, and he’s disappointed in how the VA is handling his Post-9/11 GI Bill payments. The payments cover tuition, books and living expenses.


“It become financial stress because you are wondering come October 1st how am I going to make this rent payment,” Slawinski said.


Slawinski says he filed for $10,500 in education benefits for the fall semester more than 6 weeks ago, but he says he hasn’t received anything.


“I spoke with them yesterday, and they said that they are really backlogged,” he said.


Student veteran services offices at CU Denver, the University of Denver and Regis University all report delays for some of their GI Bill recipients, especially first-time users.


In a written statement, the VA’s Veterans Benefits Administration said typically there is a “surge” in applications in the fall, and employees are averaging 29 days to process new GI Bill claims and 14 days for returning students. Those processing times are significantly longer than last fall’s, according to Department of Veterans Affairs data reviewed by 9Wants to Know.


Even so, the VBA said it is “unaware of any students’ studies being interrupted due to delays in processing education applications,” and the agency “makes every effort to provide these payments quickly.”


Slawinski says the financial snafus won’t keep him from pursuing his degree.


“It’s what I learned in the military. One inch at a time,” he said. “Don’t quit even though it looks rough.”
