Corrections & Clarifications:
 An earlier version of this report misstated the location of the shooting.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — One man was killed and two people wounded 
 campus, police said.
One of the men was taken to a hospital with multiple gunshot wounds, according to police. The other victim was grazed and did not require medical treatment. No other information about the victims was released.
The shooting began as an argument between two groups of men, said Dustin Poore of Los Rios police, who patrols Sacramento City College.
The man killed was a father of two and a student at the college, a family member said. At least one of the others wounded also was a student at the college.
Police said shots were fired in a faculty and staff parking lot near a baseball field at the south end of campus. The corner of campus where the shooting occurred is surrounded by strip malls with chain restaurants on one side and a golf course on the other.
The two-year college with about 25,000 students was placed on lockdown as officers arrived on the scene. Students later were let out of class and were seen leaving campus to head to their cars.
Rick Brewer, a spokesman for the college, said classes on the main campus were canceled for the rest of the day. Brewer said it took the college 40 minutes to send texts and phone messages warning students.
“It’s school. It’s supposed to be a good environment," student Lars Beesom said. "And you don’t want to be scared here.”
Police with help from a helicopter were searching the campus and surrounding area for the suspect and had yet to find him hours later. The suspect was described as a man with no shirt wearing cargo shorts. Police said it is unknown if the suspect is a student at the school.
Witnesses said they heard four or five shots and then saw people screaming and running from the area.
