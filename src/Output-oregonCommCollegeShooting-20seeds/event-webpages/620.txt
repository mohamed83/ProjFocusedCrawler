HOUSTON – A Houston-area family is desperately searching for answers after their loved one was found dead in the Bahamas. Mason Hart was spending his first summer after college working on a yacht.


The 23-year-old was staying in Marsh Harbour and his body was found Wednesday, July 29 about 9 miles away in Scotland Cay floating in the water.


“It makes you think something really wrong went on because that’s not natural, that’s not him,” said Amber Holesovsky, a family friend.

“Right now the case is labeled suspicious death, but my personal opinion is that it will be changing to a homicide shortly,” said David Tucker, who is in the Bahamas trying to get answers.


Tucker gave Hart a summer job on his yacht. Hart had just graduated from Texas Tech.


“It appears that he took off in the little boat to go bar hopping, which is normal around here, but he may have given somebody a ride back to marsh harbor and that person may have been a predator,” said Tucker.


Tucker says Hart was found without clothes. His wallet and the smaller boat he was in are missing.


“We’ve been very frustrated,” said Holesovsky.

Getting information on the case is slow. However, this family hopes someone can help them figure out why a young man with his whole life ahead of him was found dead at sea.


“We are racing against time to find out what happened to him and if this is in fact due to someone’s actions, why this happened and who did this?” Holesovsky.


The family said they tried to get help from the U.S. Embassy, but it was closed because of a local holiday earlier this week. An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday morning.
