Drug use has been rising steadily among college-aged students – whether or not they’re willing to admit it — according to recently released data from the 


Between 2002 and 2013, 68,600 full-time college students answered surveys about their respective drug usage — or lack thereof. The NIDA study then drew from these survey responses, identifying the peak months when college students are most likely to try certain drugs for the first time.


And based on the study’s findings, there appears to be a pattern in student drug use. Certain drugs peak during different months, according to NIDA, based on their functionality and the user’s desired results

Twelve years of 
 found students are more likely to experiment with stimulants such as Adderall or Ritalin around exam time, hoping the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medications will make studying more enticing. Use of marijuana, meanwhile, peaks during the summer months. According 
 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which examined data from the annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health, this is likely because students have more free time and are under less supervision during those months.


Students say drugs and alcohol are part of the college culture and, for some, have become an indispensable facet of social life.


“It’s definitely a social aspect of college,” Kayla Shundoff, a University of Nebraska student, says. “You meet people, whether or not you remember them. It’s easier than sitting next to someone in class and saying ‘Hey, my name’s Kayla.’”




Use of stimulants, which students commonly refer to as “study drugs,” is also on the rise, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The study found that non-medical use of stimulants has more than doubled from 2008 to 2013, with approximately 10.7% of surveyed college students admitting to having used Adderall at least once.

“I have multiple friends who have used study aids,” Keenan Danehey, a University of Nebraska student, says. “They say if they have a final the next day and they pop some ‘Addy’ and study through the night, they definitely get something out of that. But for trying to understand long-term concepts, they say they don’t get as much out of (using Adderall).”


“The new findings (by NIDA) suggest that prevention messages could be targeted at the months when college students are most vulnerable,” Brendan Saloner, an addiction researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Pubic Health, says.
