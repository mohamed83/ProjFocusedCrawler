Voices: What living off campus taught me about budgeting

Once I worked through the freshman 15, homesickness and confusion of living in a new home, my first two years at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) were a breeze.


And by breeze, I mean a financial breeze.


That’s not to say that it was cheap; my first year alone cost more than $12,500 just for room, board and student activity fees. Spread over eight months, that added up to more than $1,500 per month (yuck). However, all transactions were finalized in one beginning-of-the-year payment—I didn’t have to think about the money I was spending, because technically I had already spent it.


RELATED: 


Still, I knew I wanted out as soon as I could. I wanted to live off campus, and I wanted to save all of my precious cash I was throwing at the university. The residence halls at CWRU were not worth $1,500 per month in my mind; I would grumble at the thought of spending that much money to live in an old residence hall — which included an occasional pest problem — with no privacy. Not to mention the tiny bathrooms, loud neighbors and lack of air conditioning.


When my sophomore year ended and I was released from my on-campus housing requirement, I started looking for an apartment. Most hovered around the cost of $500 per month —  a fraction of CWRU’s housing cost. And I was ready to take whatever deal I could get.


The apartment I found was, miraculously, only $300 per month — not including gas, electric or WiFi. With utilities included, I usually paid less than $360 a month. I signed the lease right away and secured a spot for my junior year of college. Although it was old, a little farther away from campus, and (still) didn’t have air conditioning, it was one of the best deals in my neighborhood.


I didn’t care about the negatives. It was cheap.


Then, it was time to create a budget.


Really, how much could food and entertainment cost? I originally budgeted out about $50 a week, but later upped that number to $70. I learned to take my surroundings into consideration. In uptown Cleveland, Ohio, shopping in grocery stores can be just as expensive as eating out at Chipotle every day — depending on what you purchase, of course.


My final budget hovered right around $640 for every month. Thankfully, no extra bills, car payments or parking passes were part of my financial equation. Just food, a few student fees and monthly rent.


I learned to stick to my budget as best as I could —  the most important rule to follow. If I was going to spend more than $70 for the week, then the next week I had to go under that amount as much as possible. Each semester, this even included paying for the CWRU student activities fee, which was an extra $120.

But I made it work. Some of my strategies included hunting down events with free food (a college student staple), selling some no-longer-needed belongings on CWRU’s “Free & For Sale” Facebook page and hand-crafting all of my Christmas and birthday gifts.


I worked three different jobs, and saved every cent that I could. If I worked extra hours, it wasn’t an excuse to splurge that money—I stuck to my budget and put the rest away.


The worst thing I saw my fellow coworkers do was spend their money without a budget. Many would go out every weekend, or splurge on new clothes and eating at new restaurants.


Meanwhile, I learned to love the stay-at-home movie party, I crocheted hats to wear in the brisk Cleveland winters, and I learned to cook.


Food was its own special challenge, especially when it came to trying to stay healthy. It was so, so tempting to buy the 36 pack of ramen noodles and go totally #college for my junior year, or throw together a box of mac and cheese after class. Every now and then — also known as finals week —  that comfort food is necessary.


But for the rest of the academic year, I had a bag of baby carrots in the fridge for snacking. I learned to love the simple, yet tasty beans and rice. And I learned that any about-to-go-bad vegetable tastes pretty good when mixed with store-bought pasta sauce and whole grain pasta.


Those basic recipes were tasty and not entirely lacking in nutrition. After all, the greatest thing I learned — aside from budgeting and basic cooking skills — was that money isn’t more important than quality of life.


I wasn’t going to be 18, 19 or 20 years old forever. If this is going to be the best four years of my life, I wasn’t about to spend them hoarding cash under my mattress. I would have fun, but I wouldn’t be careless.


So I saved my money, but I spent it, too.
