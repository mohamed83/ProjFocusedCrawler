Millennials may not be able to send their children to college

Millennials rarely have time for lunch, let alone far off things such as sending their future children to college. However, as tuition costs continue to 
, the Millennial generation may not be able to afford their children’s college tuitions.


Several years ago, Paul Campos, a University of Colorado law professor, became concerned about his students’ ability to afford school in light of rising tuition.

“When I started looking into it, I found a dysfunctional system,” he says. “It’s not economically possible for university costs to continually outstrip the increase in wages.”

According to 
, the average tuition at a public, four-year college for the 2014-15 academic year was $9,139, a 0.8% increase from the year before.


This was a small increase compared to the 
 of school tuition and fees since 1971. If tuition continues to increase at this rate, Millennial parents will pay an average of $100,907.61 – not accounting for inflation– to send their children to a four-year public college for four years, and that is without room and board, books or other costs.


Campos says university spending on administration is a major source of the increased costs, including higher salaries for university leadership and the introduction of new departments, especially endowment offices.


Diane Duffy, the chief financial officer at the Colorado Department of Higher Education, says that as state government provides a small percentage of school funding, students must pay a more to compensate for the difference, contributing to the increased tuition.


RELATED: 


“You’re paying about two thirds of the total cost, and the tax-payers are paying about one third,” she says. “So your share has been going up, and the state’s share has been going down over the last 15 years.”


Reductions in state tax revenue during the recession caused the decrease, Duffy says.


“Over about a three year period our state appropriations were reduced by 20%. Today, in 2015, our state appropriations still are not higher than they were in 2008.”


While Campos argues that federal subsidies more than make up for the difference, both he and Duffy say the pressure to compete with other universities’ staff and amenities could also be why costs are increasing.


But whatever the ultimate cause may be, Campos says he believes the spending will have to slow down if higher education is going to be feasible for the next generation, and that it is the responsibility of professors like himself to make that happen.


“I think it’s those people that understand the institutions where they work that are in the best position to change them.”
