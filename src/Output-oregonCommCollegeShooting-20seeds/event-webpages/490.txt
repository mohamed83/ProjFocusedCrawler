More students are turning to online classes in order to balance work, internships and a personal life. (Photo by Jupiterimages)


For many people, when they think of online learning they associate it with working adults or students with disabilities. But with internships, part-time jobs and other commitments, a growing number of traditional students are choosing to take online courses in addition to courses in the traditional classroom setting.


And colleges and universities are beginning to recognize and cater to this trend.


The availability and variety of online courses for both traditional and nontraditional students is increasing steadily, and colleges are doing everything in their power to make these courses as accessible as possible for all students.


Odessa College, a community college in Odessa, Texas, is one institution that has implemented an online learning program, OC Global, geared toward all types of students.


The driving principle behind the OC Global program is that all students learn at their own paces. That way, if students need to leave school in the middle of a semester for personal reasons, they can accelerate or slow down their courses in order to reconcile their personal lives with the demands of college courses. Odessa also offers four dates within the semester when students can register for a course, so if they miss the first registration deadline, they don’t have to wait an entire semester to enroll in courses they need.


Though Odessa offers a number of degree programs that can be earned completely online, traditional students can also enroll in online courses as part of the OC Global program.


“Our focus is on the core courses so that students of any major can participate,” said Corey Davis, OC Global’s executive director.


That way, traditional students can take major-specific courses in person and complete general requirements online, said Davis.


Other universities offer general education requirements online as well, and many traditional students take advantage of this option, despite the fact that it often comes at an additional cost.


Valerie Zefiretto, a recent graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said that completing her political science and economics requirements online was helpful in completing her graphic design major. Zefiretto said that online courses allow students to complete assignments at times that work with each student’s personal schedule, leaving them with more time to work at off-campus jobs and internships.


Language courses are also common online courses at traditional universities, especially introductory courses. Students learn at their own paces and still have access to a live professor for office hours and additional help with homework.


Another factor behind Odessa’s program is alleviating costs. The OC Global program uses open source textbooks and course materials to reduce student expenses and make college courses available to as many people as possible.


This trend, too, is on the rise in America – the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has also begun an open source project to reduce the cost of student textbooks.


“Some courses lend themselves better to this than others,” Davis admits. “But it’s essential to keeping the cost down.”


According to Davis, students at Odessa frequently enrolled in courses but wouldn’t purchase the required textbooks because they couldn’t afford them. The use of high-quality, free content became an essential part of the OC Global program so that all Odessa students could participate regardless of their financial statuses.


With online courses becoming more accessible to students than ever before, students can take advantage of outside activities and enroll in courses they may not have been able to take otherwise.
