I’m sure we all look back on our freshman year of college and wish we had known how to make the transition easier.


Let’s face it, freshman year can be overwhelming. Plenty of us probably fell into the trap of buying our textbooks at the college bookstore only to later realize how much cheaper they were online. Some of us skipped class to party on a weekday, resulting in a bad relationship with a useful professor.
