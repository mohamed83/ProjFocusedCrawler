Middle Tennessee State University MTSU students, alumni and faculty joined together August 27 in cross-campus march to protest the name of Forrest Hall.


Forrest Hall, the university’s military science building, was named after Confederate Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest 
. Forrest, who participated in the 
, was also alleged to have been the 
.


After nine people were killed June 17 at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopalian Church in South Carolina in 
, MTSU students were motivated to eliminate Confederate flags and racial symbols on campus, particularly the name of Nathan Bedford Forrest Hall.

According to a 
 
in June, the hall was named after Forrest for his “military tactical genius” but in no way is a representation of racism. The release also acknowledged past attempts to change the name and said:


“Debate about the university’s ties to Forrest rose periodically through the civil rights era and beyond, with the university removing a 600-pound bronze medallion of Forrest from the Keathley University Center in 1989. Opposition to the name of Forrest Hall didn’t reach its height until 2006-07 when a number of students petitioned to have the name removed because of Forrest’s ties to the Ku Klux Klan.”


Among the protestors in 2006 was now-alumnus Andre Cante, who spoke at recent campus protests.


“After the recent events in Ferguson and Charleston and all over, a progressive university would recognize that this is the time to take it down,” Cante said.

Despite having witnessed multiple failed protests against Forrest Hall during his 28 years at the university, Michael Principe, a philosophy professor at MTSU said he believes “this will be the protest to win it for all of the failed protests.”


“It’s been battled in the past, but this is clearly the time,” Principe said at the march. “The campus has changed since it was last brought up and never before has [the movement] had so much momentum.”


Since June, the university’s 
, 
 and 
 have each composed letters to MTSU President Sidney McPhee, Ph. D. The letters each request that the hall’s name be changed, with the history department’s faculty calling it a “morally imperative” action.


“As a professor of history and a writer of history I wanted to speak today because it is history that gives us reasons why Forrest Hall should be changed,” Pippa Holloway, a MTSU history professor, said at the rally. “History tells us that Nathan Bedford Forrest was a spectacularly bad guy.”

McPhee joined the protestors in front of Forrest Hall, the final destination of the march. He then announced that he and the university are forming a committee of faculty, students and community members to determine the fate of Forrest Hall. That decision, he said, will be made sometime before April of 2016.


The committee will be headed by Derek Frisby, an MTSU global studies and cultural geography professor who specializes in the Civil War. Frisby has appeared on the National Geographic Channel’s Civil War series, 
Civil Warriors
, and was the recipient of the 2009 MTSU Outstanding Teaching Award.


Although McPhee did not share his stance on the naming issue at the protest, he told his students that he was proud of their ability to create and uphold a movement.


“It’s nice to see this– students calmly standing-up against an issue together– we have a rich history of students peacefully organizing against certain issues,” McPhee said. “People who care, very peacefully voicing concern or opinions about a certain issue is exactly what this university stands for. I’m really pleased with the students because today was a great example of that.”
