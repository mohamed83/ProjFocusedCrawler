ATHENS, Ga. (WXIA) — Authorities say a 21-year-old University of Georgia student was found dead in a dormitory on Thursday.


RELATED: 


University police said they were called to Russell Hall just after 6 p.m. Thursday on a medical assistance call. When they arrived, they immediately began first aid efforts for the young woman. Authorities said they believe she was dead when they arrived.

The woman identified as Mikal Ghirmazghi.


The case is upsetting to students and also baffling to police. They said there was no obvious cause of death and no sign of foul play.


A preliminary investigation by the county coroner revealed no clear-cut answer to what happened or why. Local authorities planned to continue their investigation through the night.
