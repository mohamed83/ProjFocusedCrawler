The notion of paying for college is stressful enough without having to worry about making missteps when you’re searching for scholarships.


In the quest to receiving financial aid, there is a path through the mine field.


Here are some things to remember:


Applying for a federal student loan is free 


“Don’t ever pay for a federal financial aid application,” said Colby McCarthy, director of financial assistance at 
. “It’s a free application. You shouldn’t be paying for it.”


A search on Google for “federal financial aid” might result in links for companies that will help you file the form for a fee. Before you click, look for the site that ends in .gov. 


Need help filling out the form? Contact your college’s financial aid office, McCarthy said.


Don’t pay for help finding scholarships, 
the U.S. Department of Education says 


Save your money. “I can’t see paying for that when you can get the help for free,” Colby said. (If you do pay, be careful of a promise of guaranteed results. A company could say it did its job if you get a $200 scholarship or a student loan offer, the education department said.)


College financial aid offices and guidance offices at high schools can help find leads for scholarships, McCarthy said. There are also online sources such as 
 and the U.S. Department of Labor’s
. Don’t forget about nonprofit groups, clubs and organizations in your community. They might offer scholarships as well.


But one thing’s for sure, you probably should expect some competition. For instance, a random search by Press on Your Side found a contest by the American Fire Sprinkler Association that awards 10 $2,000 grants to students who win a drawing after answering an online quiz on fire sprinklers. The process attracts 85,000 applicants. (And only the winners are notified.)


Never pay to receive financial aid 


“Most places don’t ask you for money to give you money,” McCarthy said.


Protect your personal information 


While you’ll need to give your Social Security number when you apply for a federal student aid, you don’t need to give it when you apply for scholarships and other aid. “Be careful what information you are providing,” Colby said. “Federal aid is the only application you should be providing that Social Security number for.”


Never share your FSA ID with anyone, even a family member 


It serves as your legal signature and only you can create one for your federal student aid application. “That’s a portal to all kinds of private information,” said Deanne Loonin, an attorney and director of the 
. Not only are you not supposed to give it out, but companies and others are not supposed to ask for it.


Unfortunately for many, paying off a college loan can be a rough ride.


According to the U.S. Department of Education, federal student loan delinquency is rising as 1.2 million recipients were 31 to 90 days delinquent in payments, owing a total of $26.5 billion in the quarter ended June 30, up from 1.19 million owing a total of $23.4 billion for the same quarter a year earlier.


“Student debt problems are growing,” Loonin said.
