COBB COUNTY, GA (WXIA) – Two of the 
., were from metro Atlanta. They were among five Georgia Southern University nursing students who died on Interstate 16, while heading to nursing clinicals in Savannah.


Officials say they were in one of five cars that collided with two semis. The cause of the crash is not yet known.


Emily Clark lived in Powder Springs. She was a junior at Georgia Southern. Catherine Pittman was also a junior, and lived in Alpharetta. Both were active on and off campus, and their deaths hit a lot of people very hard.


Clark was a graduate of Harrison High School, and friends said she was excited about getting her white coat – which meant that she was admitted to the nursing program at Georgia Southern.


She was extremely close to her family, and they were all grieving in private on Wednesday evening at their home – devastated, as you could imagine.


The same was true for relatives of Pittman. They were secluded at their home as well. The 21-year-old was a graduate of Milton High School, and friends say she was thrilled to be in the nursing program, and had plans to serve underprivileged communities in Georgia when she graduated.


At this point, there is no word on funeral plans for the young women. The family is still coping with the terrible news that they will not be coming home again.
