College students have gathered in places as far west from Charleston, S.C. as Berkeley, Calif. and as close as nearby cities like Atlanta. On their lips are the 
who were shot and killed at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.

It is reported that Roof wanted to “

But Aurielle Lucier, co-founder of 
, an Atlanta-based, millennial-led advocacy group, says Roof’s actions to fuel racial animosity have led to a different outcome.


“What has actually happened is a race war of another kind. We are having conversations. We are challenging each other’s thought processes around race, race identity and racism. People of color are more brazen in challenging people who are white and who are their friends.”


Lucier says that her organization — alongside the City of Atlanta Activists, an informal activist group — organized a vigil that gathered around 200 people at the Big Bethel AME Church near the Georgia State Capitol.

The perseverance of the church known as “Mother Emanuel” has transcended regional borders, reaching black and white communities alike.


It has resonated on college campuses where — despite the ongoing summer hiatus — people have gathered in solidarity.


At Emory University, a vigil was hosted at the Wesley Teaching Chapel at the Candler School of Theology. Emory University President Jim Wagner was one of 100 attendants.


“While it is summertime and our students are scattered … we wanted to respond as quickly as we could in a way that all of us here at Candler would do with students, with faculty, with staff… to gather for prayer and solidarity as people who are committed to racial justice,” says Rev. Ellen Echols Purdum, assistant dean of students at the theology school.

Nine candles lit the altar as the names of the victims were read. A journal was laid on a table where those present were able to write notes to the Emanuel AME congregation — some attendees even took a break from their jobs to do so, Purdum says.


On the opposite end of the country, students at UC Berkeley followed in a similar manner.

“We began by explaining what happened in Charleston, South Carolina — the massacre of black people by a white terrorist,” Yoel Haile, political director of the 
, says. “We read their names, did a moment of silence and we opened the space for discussion for people to be able say what was in their hearts and minds.”


The vigil was attended by around 100 students, Haile adds.


In South Carolina, people crossed the Arthur Ravenel Bridge in demonstration of love and unity.  According to
