Visiting a college or university campus is a lot like meeting an individual who you’ve heard so much about. You can learn a great deal from a school’s website or through correspondence with an alumnus or a student, but a campus visit allows you to experience the college or university much more completely — and to ask questions!


Consider the following four when you meet with professors at a prospective school.


1. What are the strengths of the program or department?


As you decide which college or university to attend, it can be helpful to know the particular strengths of each. Ask professors to identify the top strengths of their department or program — they will likely have insider information that is not listed online or in a brochure. Because the term “strengths” is fairly open-ended, you may be able to speak with them about the department’s values — such as diversity or leadership — or about more tangible aspects like internships or relationships with outside organizations. Once you know these strengths, you will be able to better compare schools or mentally prepare yourself before classes begin.


2. What kinds of coursework or capstone projects can I expect to complete?


While each person’s experience at a particular college or university is unique, it can be helpful to know the structure of the program or department, as well as whether or not it matches your learning style. Ask about required classes and available electives. What are the formats of the required courses — are they lectures, seminars, labs or independent studies? Will you have to complete a thesis, capstone project, outside internship or research?

Of course, no school will be completely perfect in its requirements. Keep this in mind as you search for the department or program that suits your work ethic, habits and priorities the most. Determine whether you can sit in on a class you might take next year and observe student-student and faculty-student interaction. Inquire about previous students’ capstone projects or theses — is it possible to view any of them? All of these items will allow you to paint a fuller picture of your potential experience at this college or university.


3. Besides courses, what other opportunities or resources are available?


We all know that attending college is not solely about completing courses, writing papers and studying for exams. When you meet professors, ask them about opportunities or resources that can extend your learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. For example, are there on-campus electronic resources, audio-visual equipment, computer labs, libraries or specific library resources that can expand your thinking or a project you’re working on? Are there ongoing programs that speak to your interests and passions, like cultural clubs or film festivals? What about study abroad programs or internships in the community, during the school year or summertime?


This information can quickly tip your decision toward one school. Professors can also point you to specific resources or other students and faculty members with whom you can network.


4. What is the academic community like?


Besides electives and extracurricular activities, you’ll likely spend the bulk of your time with your cohort and others in your program. As a result, you might wish to ask professors about the dynamic amongst students in class and outside of class. Are there formal or informal study groups? Is there a peer mentorship or faculty mentorship program? How large is the department or program, and what advantages are there due to size? You may also wish to inquire about faculty-student ratio and interaction. Professors are often busy with their own research or projects, yet they may still set aside ample time to meet with students on a drop-in basis or through various program events. Try to decide if your work ethic vibes with what the professors say about this department or program.


As you tour campuses, keep your eyes and ears open for any item that will tell you more about the school. It’s important to not just observe, but, if possible, to meet with professors and ask questions as well. Once you find a college or university that you like and are excited about, you can (ideally) stay in touch with some of these contacts. This can help you begin to build academic relationships that are valuable throughout the length of your study and long after graduation.
