Campus clubs can play a key role in providing undergraduate students with hands-on experience in their dream career field. This is especially key for students majoring in journalism or communications, where an experience-filled and top-notch resume is absolutely necessary to secure an internship, let alone a job.


So if you want to jump into the world of PR, integrated marketing or multimedia journalism, but your school lacks an organization to help get your feet wet, why not start your own chapter? Added bonus: You can put president, founder or editor-in-chief on your resume!


Public Relations Student Society of America


Launching a 
, an organization for students who are interested in public relations and communications, is a smart career move for a budding PR maven.

Leading your campus’ chapter allows you to get involved with and even hired by other groups and clubs at your school. As part of a 300-chapter network composed of 11,000 students (and growing), you will expose yourself to extremely valuable networking professionals, including faculty, chapter advisors and contacts from PRSSA’s parent organization, the 
.


To begin a PRSSA chapter, secure your eligibility by confirming that your school fits the necessary criteria. Then, seek endorsement from a PRSA sponsor. You must have at least 10 students willing to join the chapter. Find a faculty advisor and a professional advisor, submit a formal application and become the president of the new PRSSA chapter at your school —  it’s that easy!

Founded by three then-undergraduate Harvard women, 
 is an online magazine website. It posits itself as the No. 1 global community for college women, boasting more than 6,000 contributors. Her Campus allows you to create your own “magazine” specifically for your college or university, making you the editor-in-chief in charge of your very own editorial team.


By 
, you’ll be in charge of producing content spanning six different areas, managing your team and publicizing your publication. You can even get internship credit if you’re the chapter leader.


Did we mention Her Campus contributors have gone on to work for various high-profile media organizations? Not too shabby.


The Society of Professional Journalists


If you’re a serious rising journalist, take some time out of your busy schedule (which is probably spent in your campus’ newsroom) to 
 at your school.


 has been around since 1909 and is described as the nation’s most broad-based journalism organization. It aims to improve and protect the practice of journalism.


Creating a chapter is pretty simple. It requires a formal application and at least 10 confirmed students to join. SPJ offers conferences, programs and seminars for members and also recognizes outstanding collegiate journalists annually with Mark of Excellence Awards.


Ed2010


 aims to make its members the editorial industry’s next big success stories.


This online community provides everything from networking events to salary reportings and job openings. It has campus chapters at a number of schools nationwide —  including, but not limited to, Boston University, University of Southern California, University of North Carolina and Rutgers University.


If you’re interested in bringing 
, reach out to the team expressing your interest. By leading an Ed2010 chapter you can take part in panels, bolster your resume, go on tours to magazine offices and learn how to break into the magazine industry.


Whether you prefer the fast-paced newsroom is your calling or the endless possibilities of the Internet, be sure not to waste your communications or journalism degree by failing to get involved on campus and in the real world.
