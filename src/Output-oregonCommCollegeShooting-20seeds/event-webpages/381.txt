Many times, high school grads or GED recipients who opt for community colleges have little knowledge about the path they want to take towards a career or barely even have any idea what they want to major in. Let’s give them a benefit of the doubt. They do not need to know everything.


However, the following five tips are worth keeping in mind if you seek enrollment at a two-year college after receiving either a high school or GED diploma.


1. The transfer process isn’t impossible


For starters, know that you can make it to prestigious four-year colleges if you put in the work. Bad raps and online articles about how beginning your educational career at two-year colleges slim your chances of getting admitted prestigious universities and many other myths related to community colleges are in abundance.


Take these lightly and don’t disturb your heads too much with the transfer admission rates of whatever prestigious schools you hope to matriculate into. — these are vibe killers.


What you should keep in mind is that hard work always pays off. It all depends on you and the amount of grind you put into your education. Great GPA’s are easy to get and maintain once you take your school work seriously. You get out what you put in.


2. Scholarships do exist


Yes, there are a lot of scholarships offered to high school graduates opting for two-year colleges as much as there are for those choosing four-year colleges. In addition, most two-year colleges themselves offer various scholarships to their students. Just do your homework and make it happen. Community Colleges are decisively cheaper as compared to four-year colleges but scholarships can make your time there a roller-coaster. Please take advantage. Extra bucks never tore a wallet.


3. Engage aggressively


Engaging in research, extracurricular, or sports activities, and even international studies (for those who can) is also another area to take seriously. This I cannot stress enough. There are countless volunteer opportunities available at two-year colleges. Research assistants, various student clubs and organizations, college newspapers, you name it. Please find two or three you would be a sucker for and engage aggressively. D


o not wait till your transfer application deadlines are imminent. Building your credibility at the college level from day one is advisable because you’re not going anywhere worthwhile without any involvement in extracurriculars.


4. Challenge your brain


Try to join honor societies (Phi Theta Kappa, DECA, Psi Beta, etc.), take an honors class or at least do an honors project. Aside from the recognition, involvement in these would serve as a strong signal of your academic prowess to admission officers at your dream four-year college or even to potential employers. This could also be a great option for students who fail to attain a high GPA before transferring.


Endeavors like the aforementioned prepare you not only for the rigorous work at the four-year universities you are looking forward to transfer into, but would also likely present you with the chance to interact and have some pretty cool times with various faculties and other like-minded students.


5. Have a good attitude


Finally, go in with a positive attitude and a sense of pride knowing that if you put in work you would go on to be successful. Never be afraid to seek help when you need it or approach your professors when you feel overwhelmed with course work. After all, they would submit the lecturer recommendations when it is time to continue at a four-year college.


Also know that Community Colleges are DIVERSITY at its finest! Take advantage, make friends, and above everything, believe in yourself.
