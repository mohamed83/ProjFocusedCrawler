At least three people were shot early Thursday at 
 library before campus police shot and killed the gunman, Tallahassee police said.


Officers confronted the gunman, an FSU alumnus named Myron May according to reports from the Associated Press, and ordered him to drop his weapon. But he fired one shot at them and they unleashed a volley of shots, Tallahassee Police spokesman Dave Northway said.


Nursing supervisor Ian Clark at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, a Level 2 trauma center, confirmed that patients had been brought to the facility with gunshot wounds but declined to elaborate further.


One of the injured was in a critical condition, according to CNN.


University President John Thrasher described the shootings as an isolated incident but also said police did “an extraordinary job taking quick and decisive action to prevent further tragedy.” Officials canceled classes Thursday and made counseling available to students and staff.


The incident at Strozier Library started shortly before 1 a.m. ET, three freshmen who were in the DeGraff Hall dormitory at the time said. The students began getting reports from friends locked down in the library.


“We know there are definitely people who saw the shooter,” Anthony Coons said.


His friend Max Martin described the surreal scene.


“You hear all these stories on the news, then it happens,” Martin said. “This is something you never want to happen.”










Nikolai Hernandez, who was in another dorm room nearby, said he heard “consecutive gunshots” that sounded as if they came from an automatic rifle.


“That was confirmed when I went outside and talked to someone who said they say police open fire on a shooter who was armed right on the front steps of the library,” the freshman said.


More than 20 emergency vehicles from Tallahassee’s police and fire departments, as well as from Leon County Emergency Services, blocked off the area around Landis Green, near the library. Strozier, the campus’ main library, is named for a former president of the university and is usually open 24 hours on weekdays.


According to 
FSView
, a Gannett student newspaper, the library was being cleared out by about 3 a.m. Before that, students were on lockdown in Dirac Library and in dorms.


The video below was posted on Facebook by Jessica Davis. An individual can be heard over the intercom saying “There has been a shooting in the library. Stay where you are,” and instructing people to call 911 if they have been shot.
