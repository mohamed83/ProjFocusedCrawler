Here's what to do when you have 20 minutes to kill between classes

If you have 10 free minutes before your next class, you can take a quick bathroom break and wash up.


If you’ve got 30 free minutes, you have just enough time to watch an episode of just about 
.


But if you have 20 free minutes, you’re in trouble: it’s too much time to do anything menial, but not enough time to do anything productive. Incidentally, 20 minutes is the standard amount of time to have between college classes, so you’re probably stuck in the 1/3 hour trap with the rest of us.


Luckily, there’s a solution to your medium-sized boredom! Here are some creative ways to kill time without awkwardly sitting outside your 
 door:


Make up identities for everyone you see


Go find a place outside to sit and take a quick glance at the people who pass by. Based on their appearance, try to guess what they do for a living. The more creative you are, the funnier your ideas will be. This works even better when you have a friend to bounce your ideas off of.


Write the world’s shortest story


Writing a story is probably the quickest way to pass the time. All you have to do is think of a paragraph-long blurb to write, and then put it on paper.


RELATED: 


This idea helps keep your brain productive, which will help you mentally prepare for any classes where you will have to write or think critically. If you have some free time at the same place every day, you can even turn your quick stories into a series over the course of the semester.


Think about something no one ever thinks about


Make a random observation, raise a question about it, and try to answer it. How does a bus driver close the door once he gets off the bus? Why is Iceland green, and Greenland icy? Why does the drive-though ATM have directions in braille? How do they get pimentos inside green olives?


Listen to music and watch people walk to the beat


If you put in your headphones and put on a song, you will notice that a lot of people passing by will vaguely walk to the beat. This works for just about any song with a relatively slow or medium pace. For the funniest results, try it with disco or funk.


Write weird letters


…and leave them for people to find. Write from the perspective of a survivor of the post-apocalyptic future, a disgruntled 16th century sea captain, or a man lost in the jungles of Thailand: whatever floats your boat. Just remember that someone will eventually find your note, and it will presumably make their day.


Try not to think about penguins


This is a strange but simple way to kill time. No matter how hard you try not to think about penguins, you will still be thinking about penguins. If you realize that you weren’t thinking about penguins, then you’re suddenly thinking about penguins. It’s an endless trap.
