Former speaker of the House Dennis Hastert’s name will no longer be on Wheaton College’s Center for Economics, Government and Public Policy.


Officially called the J. Dennis Hastert center, the university is now removing the alumnus’ name amid his recent legal trouble. According to 
, the former GOP speaker, indicted in May, “allegedly made a series of illegally structured bank withdrawals as part of an effort to conceal past sexual misconduct with an unnamed person.”


“In light of the charges and allegations that have emerged, the College has re-designated the Center as the Wheaton College Center for Economics, Government, and Public Policy at this time,” the College wrote 
 on its website.


The statement also noted his May 29 resignation from the school’s board of advisors.


The Christian college maintains that despite Hastert’s role in the creation of the center, it will “continue to serve these purposes in conformity with the highest ethical and academic standards of excellence and integrity.”


Hastert is a ’64 graduate of Wheaton College, where he studied economics.
