College students are becoming more confident and less competent when it comes to managing their personal finances, a new 
 finds.


The survey, which was conducted by financial aid company Higher One and education technology company EverFi, found that college students in 2014 were more likely to have and use more than one credit card than they were in 2012. The survey also found that those same students were far less likely to pay their credit card bills, make and stick to a budget, put money into savings, balance their checkbook or track their credit score.


This recklessness can be credited to a variety of financial and cultural factors, says Mary Johnson, vice president of financial literacy and student aid policy at Higher One.

“It really underscores the need for more personal finance education, specifically before students even get to college,” Johnson says. “It’s so important for students to be able to stay in school.”


Only 17 states require any financial literacy education for high school graduates, and only six test them on it, the report indicates.

The survey encompassed 42,000 freshmen at four-year colleges, as well as 1,000 first- and second-year community college students. Students at community college were more likely to report responsible financial behaviors than those at four-year universities, which could be linked to the fact that they were also four times less likely to have their money managed by their parents.


The number of students who said they planned to make and follow a budget dropped by more than 10% between 2012 and 2014. Even with student debt on the rise, the 2014 students were less likely than those in 2012 to say they had plans to consolidate or make payments on their loans.


Laura Abbott, a fourth-year English and neuroscience major at Washington State University, says this trend is tied to a growing sense of helplessness she and her peers feel toward chipping away at their debt.

Students are terrified of even looking at their number, Abbott says. They don’t want to know.


Administrators at Indiana University are looking to combat this effect, keeping accrued debt in students’ minds by keeping it in their sight. In 2012, the 
 at the bottom of every college payment. Student loans at IU have since dropped by 12.4 percent, says Phil Schuman, director of the school’s financial literacy program.


Schuman says that the sheer magnitude of student loans can have a “Monopoly money” effect on students, where the number gets too high to even register as real.


“Most the students that are coming to school, they’ve never dealt with thousands of dollars in their life,” Schuman says. “You sign the dotted line and all this money floods to you and helps you fund your education, and people don’t really understand what paying that back will mean.”


Day to day, this denial can leak into minor spending habits, especially as the culture of college becomes more decadent and students feel pressure to keep up with their peers’ spending habits, Schuman says.


RELATED: 


“I think that students are to prone to making mistakes in college because there are more things out there for students to spend their money on,” Schuman says. “The culture of college is changing, and it’s becoming more expensive.”


For Abbott, making and sticking to a budget while trying to “keep up with the Joneses” is nearly impossible, a trait she says is related to her background. A child of divorce, she bounced between two financial extremes – one side of her family didn’t have enough money to stick to a budget, while the other side had so much that day-to-day expenses weren’t significant enough to plan around.


“If you don’t have money to budget — if you don’t have excess money — you can’t budget it. So students who were raised in homes that were in poverty or close to poverty probably didn’t see any excess money because you were literally living check to check,” Abbott says.


Johnson says that a student’s background can play a huge role in how they approach money. For those who never see an empty wallet, money seems less concrete which is compounded by the rise of credit card usage.


“In today’s generation, students might not get that much experience at home because hardly anyone uses cash anymore,” Johnson says.


Johnson says that everyone — parents, schools and students — can do more to help students responsibly manage their finances.


She says that getting a handle on your finances can start with something very basic.


“Go look at your online bank statement,” Johnson says. “Identify two or three things you could have done without. It’s about taking a few minutes, some mental moments, to be conscious about spending.”
