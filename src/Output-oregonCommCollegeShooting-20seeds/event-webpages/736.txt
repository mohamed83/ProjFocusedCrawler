The best way to avoid college debt? Go to a tuition-free school

Amid the constant chatter about rising college costs and mounting student loan debts, politicians such as 
 and 
 are offering a solution: free tuition.


The proposals may seem unrealistic, but free college is already a reality at a handful of U.S. schools.


, an elite engineering school in New York, has been tuition-free for more than 125 years. And 
 in Kentucky has covered tuition for students almost as long.


All told, at least a dozen colleges and universities offer free tuition to admitted students. Some do so in exchange for students’ work or service commitments. Others pay tuition as a reward for students talented enough to gain entry into their highly selective, highly specialized programs.

Will work for tuition


Alice Lloyd guarantees a full-tuition scholarship to all admitted students. In return, the school asks students to work at least 10 hours a week , though some work more for additional pay, says Jim Stepp, the college’s executive vice president.


“If a young person has academic ability, is not afraid to roll their sleeves up and work for what they get and has good character, then money is not an issue,” Stepp says.


Location might be, though.


Alice Lloyd covers tuition only for students in a designated area that 
, which includes parts of Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.

 in Missouri and 
 in Kentucky have tuition models similar to that at Alice Lloyd but are open to students who live anywhere in the U.S. or abroad.


At College of the Ozarks, students work 15 hours each week, plus two 40-hour weeks when classes aren’t in session. Berea College students have to work at least 10 hours a week on campus in exchange for a full-tuition scholarship and a small paycheck.


“It’s almost as if you’re getting paid $24 per hour, but $20 of that is going to pay tuition and you get a check for the rest,” says Annah Pierce, 20, a junior at Berea College. “It’s not large, but it can go toward other educational expenses.”


Those expenses include room and board, which most tuition-free colleges do not cover. Exceptions to that rule include 
 in California.


A two-year college that operates a working cattle ranch, Deep Springs covers tuition, fees, room and board. The school enrolls only a handful of students each year, compared with other work colleges like Alice Lloyd, which enroll a few hundred annually. Currently, Deep Springs enrolls only male students.


Most work colleges were designed to serve low-income students, and some — including Berea — will turn down applicants if their families earn too much.


“Our average family income is $27,000 for a family of four. That’s the kind of families that our students come from,”says Chad Berry, academic vice president and dean of the faculty at Berea.


“If you got a 36 on the ACT and are a perfect student, but your father is a surgeon and your mother is a Wall Street banker, we will not admit you no matter what, because you come from a family that has many, many opportunities for high-quality education.”


A commitment to service


The best-known examples of service for tuition are the U.S. Military Academy in New York, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut, the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland, the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado and the 
, also in New York. All have stringent admission requirements.


Graduates are expected to serve at least five years on active duty with their respective service after they complete their education. Those who attended the Merchant Marine Academy can choose between five years’ active duty in any branch of the military, or five years working in the maritime industry plus eight years in a reserve unit.


If you’d rather teach in New York City’s public schools than join the military, the 
 is another tuition-free route.


The Teacher Academy provides a four-year tuition scholarship to qualifying students who pursue a math or science degree . In exchange, students commit to teaching for at least two years at a high-need public school in New York City.


Merit rewards


Not all tuition-free colleges ask for something in return. Some simply reward students with exemplary academic achievements. Those include 
 at CUNY, Webb Institute in New York and the 
 in Philadelphia.


Both Webb and the Curtis cater to students with specific academic interests. At Webb, that’s engineering. Each of the school’s roughly 80 students earns a dual degree in naval architecture and marine engineering. The programs of study at Curtis Institute include composition, conducting, vocal studies and woodwinds, among others.


The takeaway


Students can graduate debt-free without sacrificing their education, if they’re willing to work for it. That’s especially true for students who come from low-income families.


And just because you’ve never heard of a school like Berea or Deep Springs doesn’t mean graduate-school admissions officers and employers haven’t. Just ask Berea’s Pierce.


“When I look for internships and when I look at prospective employers, they’ve all heard of Berea,” Pierce says. “It’s really interesting to think that a school that I heard so little about had such a strong reputation behind it.”
