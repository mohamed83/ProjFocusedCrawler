Recent campus shootings raise safety concerns

 by a gunman at a community college in Oregon — in which 10 were killed and 7 injured — is just the latest incident in an especially tragic start to schools nationwide.


On Sept. 3, three people were shot in a faculty and staff parking area 
at 
 in Sacramento, Calif., 
 and two hurt.


In August, there were two shootings: On Aug. 27, a 
 (SSU) student was fatally shot during an altercation in SSU’s student union; and on Aug. 26, two people were shot on the campus of 
 (TSU), resulting in one death and a suspect in custody.

Lockdowns due to active shooter alerts have added to the tensions. On Sept. 4, Kansas State University received reports about a possible armed suspect on campus, according to Steve Logback, the school’s associate vice president of communications and marketing. The campus was on lockdown while police conducted a search, and an all-clear was given.


And earlier on the day of the Aug. 26 shooting at TSU, 
 was on lockdown due to an active shooter alert. The suspect, a student determined to be “suicidal” by police, was later taken into custody.


There has been a 
, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education. In 2013, the last year data was available, 23 people died on campus at American post-secondary institutions to murder or non-negligent manslaughter
. That number was 17 in 2009 (none were due to negligent manslaughter) and in 2008, there were 15 murders and non-negligent manslaughter incidents. (In 2011, the number pushed up to 45 due to the Virginia Tech shooting.)


William Taylor, president of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators and chief of police at San Jacinto College, says an increase in campus violence and shootings may reflect an increase in violence nationwide.


“Part of it is indicative that in culture as a whole, there’s more violence going on. It happens that in the past 15 years or so, the level of violence in the country has escalated, and weapons become part of that,” says Taylor. “And obviously because campuses are not isolated from their communities, as much as they like to think they are, anything that happens out in the local community can come onto a campus.”


Taylor says campus shootings have also gained increased attention due to social media and the Internet.


RELATED: 


“With our current electronic systems and news media … virtually everything gets out into the public realm,” he says. “That raises the knowledge of the number of incidents that happen.”


Scott Austin, operations division commander for Christopher Newport University police, adds that media coverage of campus violence can lead people to view colleges as unsafe.


“Campuses across the nation probably are a lot safer than sometimes reported out in the media,” he says. “We have an incident that takes place and the media will sensationalize it, and it’s the perception of the general public to think ‘Well, there is another big incident happening at a college. Colleges are so unsafe.’ And it’s not necessarily true.”


Regardless, campus law enforcement agencies are continuing to evaluate their practices and train their employees to deal with campus violence.


Alison Kiss, executive director of the Clery Center for Security on Campus, says colleges should be taking proactive measures by identifying threats before an incident occurs.


“(Following the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting) we saw quite a focus on the increase in threat-assessment teams … so a way for campuses to look at tools and identify if there’s a mental health risk, if there’s a threat, if there’s a potential threat of violence to someone’s self or someone else,” she says.


Threat assessment, Kiss explains, includes providing help for students who have been identified in need of mental health care.

Taylor says more colleges are adopting full police departments, which require campus officers to meet the same standards as any other police officer in that state. Not every state allows this, he says.


“The national trend is to raise up to the level of police department and have people armed,” he says. “A lot of police departments on (campuses) not only have side arms, which is the weapon they carry on their pistol belt or on their belt, but a lot of them are also issuing rifles to their people to be able to respond to an active shooter situation.”


He says not all campus shootings are classified as active shooter situations.


“The shooting in Savannah, that was a targeted shooting,” he says. “It was about that person and it wasn’t random and it wasn’t a mass shooting.” 


Austin says another possible solution to campus violence is encouraging students to report any suspicious people or incidents they notice.


“Reporting things to us is good crime prevention because if we get to go check it out, many times there’s something there,” he says. “And if there’s not, no problem.”
