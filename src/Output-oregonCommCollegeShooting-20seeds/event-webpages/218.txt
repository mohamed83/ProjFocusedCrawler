A student missing from Denison University in Granville, Ohio was found dead on Tuesday morning in the school’s Biological Reserve, according to a 
 from the university.


Wendell Jackson, a junior from Chicago, was last seen Sunday evening, before a friend found a note in his jacket pocket and called campus security.


The school announced on their website Monday evening that Jackson was missing. Hundreds of students and professionals voluntarily scoured the campus looking for him — all hoping that Jackson would turn up.


“The loss of a member of our community is hard,” said the university. “We need to be there for each other. Denison is a remarkably strong, compassionate and empathetic community. In the coming days, we will need to draw on our sense of community and our commitment to one another. We will get through this together, but it is important to be there for each other.”


While the school has not released cause of death, 
 reports that Licking County Deputy Coroner Jeff Lee ruled the death a suicide — “Jackson had hanged himself from a tree.”


“Wendell was a remarkable person,” wrote university president Adam Weinberg. “He was both liked and admired by all who knew him. He was an important member of our community and will be missed. Like many of you, I am grieving the loss of a student who enriched my life in ways large and small.”


Jackson was a resident assistant, admissions host and a graduate of the LeaderShape program, 
.


On Tuesday night, the university held a candlelight vigil for Jackson to honor and celebrate his life — the school is working with Jackson’s family to plan a memorial service.


Jackson’s mother Wendy, a single mother of four, has created a 
 account, which has $7,000 of a $50,000 goal, as of Tuesday night.


“I am [devastated] and I would like to give my only son a nice home going,” she said. “Wendell was an outstanding student with goals of becoming a personal trainer. Wendell was my backbone and great inspiration for his [siblings].”
