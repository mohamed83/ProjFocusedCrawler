CHAPEL HILL, N.C. – Three people were shot and killed Tuesday night at a condominium complex in Chapel Hill.


Police said the shooting happened at the Finley Forest complex after 5 p.m. according to 


WRAL is reporting 46-year-old Craig Stephen Hicks turned himself in to the Chatham County Sheriff’s Office in Pittsboro following the shooting. He’s been charged with three counts of first-degree murder.


Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, of Chapel Hill, Yusor Mohammad, 21, of Chapel Hill, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, of Raleigh, were pronounced dead at the scene, police said.


All three victims were shot in the head, sources said.


Barakat, a second-year dental student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, married Yusor Mohammad in late December. Mohammad is listed on her Facebook page as a student at North Carolina State University, and officials at UNC said she was planning to begin dental studies in Chapel Hill this fall.


Abu-Salha, Yusor’s younger sister, is listed at a sophomore at NC State and a graduate of Athens Drive High School in Raleigh.


Investigators have not said what led to the shootings. Hicks was being held without bond early Wednesday in the Durham County jail. He is scheduled to make a first court appearance Wednesday morning.


The shootings came as a surprise to Bethany Boring, who encountered police cars, crime scene tape and people visibly upset when she stepped out of her home to walk her dog.


“It’s a very quiet community,” she said. “It’s a lot of graduate and professional students. You know, professional’s families.”


Daniel Waggoner echoed Boring’s description of the neighborhood.


“I’m up late. I come home late and it’s always quiet when I get here,” he said. “So I mean yeah, it’s surprising.”
