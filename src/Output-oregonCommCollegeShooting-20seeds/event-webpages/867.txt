Tulane University grapples with rise in student deaths

NEW ORLEANS — What appears to be a murder-suicide has people in one New Orleans neighborhood shocked, and it’s forcing Tulane University to cope with an unprecedented spike in student deaths.


New Orleans police say the Uptown apartment where a 28-year-old man shot and killed his 25-year-old girlfriend had no previous calls for help. Both were Tulane law students.


In the past, Tulane has experienced one or two student deaths during a school year. This year there are seven.


“Certainly the number of deaths that we’ve experienced has been an abnormality and the fact that we’ve had several due to suicide, is very strange for us,” said Dr. Dusty Porter, the vice-president of Student Affairs at Tulane University.


The apparent murder-suicide brings the number of suicides to four, along with one murder, a natural seizure death and a fall from a balcony. The suicides are unrelated.


“Alcohol or drugs probably did play a part in at least one or two of them, but there’s not a common thread,” Dr. Porter said about the suicides.


In December, Tulane had webinars for parents and faculty on suicide awareness. The university increased communication with students about mental health needs and also had a vigil.


Now administrators hope to push up the start date of a new planned hotline.


“There’s already a 24-hour number that is staffed by somebody on campus, but we want the students to know that they can also talk with a psychologist or a licensed counselor,” Dr. Porter said.


Dr. Porter said this way there can be follow-up treatment.


The students are glad there is help.


“I’m not exactly sure what’s going on, but I really hope that the improved services here can really help students, because I know, like, mental health is such a big issue and I’m glad they’re trying to understand it more,” said Elizabeth Thomas, a Tulane Public Health graduate student.


“It’s been such a wonderful experience and it’s a great environment and it’s just sad to see someone not happy. And I really wish that they could have gotten the help that they needed,” said Tulane freshman Izzat Shbeeb.


In the last year, Tulane has seen a 40% increase in the number of students asking for mental health services.


Some of the increase may come from the loss of life on campus or now being more aware of their own depression and treatment needs.


Some students arrive already in therapy or on medication, and for some, there is now a greater awareness and less stigma of the importance of mental health treatment.


The coroner identifies the second-year law students in Sunday’s murder-suicide as Sara Lamont, 25, and Wajih Mazloum, 28.


The city of New Orleans says that Mazolum, the alleged shooter, was an unpaid intern law clerk with the city.
