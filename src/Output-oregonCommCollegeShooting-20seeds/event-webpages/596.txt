As most college seniors head back for their final semester of school, Daniel Simon is preparing for a different adventure.


Simon, who recently graduated a semester early from Emory University, decided missing a few good parties was worth the opportunity of a lifetime. He overloaded his schedule during the past few semester so he could graduate early and start working at The Gersh Agency, a talent agency located in Beverly Hills, Calif.


“I was very checked out of college when I saw this opportunity,” says Simon. “I wasn’t feeling like this is where I needed to be for another six months. I wanted to really grow.”


But Simon, who also cites saving money as a main motivator, soon realized he wasn’t alone.


“I thought I was going to be an anomaly because I had a very fortunate situation,” says Simon. “But people are becoming more and more job-centric and career-oriented, and they want to get out of the college bubble.”.


“People are becoming more and more job centric and career-oriented, and they want to get out of the college bubble.”.


Simon is just one of many college seniors choosing to ditch the traditional springtime cap and gown ceremony in exchange for a head start in the real world.


A number of universities report that more students are choosing to graduate in December. At Duke University this number increased 
 According to Joanne Brzinski, Emory’s senior associate dean for undergraduate education, the university has seen a more subtle 1% growth in the last few years.


Paul Fowler, the executive director of Emory’s career center, cites AP credits and tuition costs as major factors driving students towards graduating early. He notes that many of his advisees question whether this is the best path.


“That is the million dollar question,” Fowler writes in an e-mail. “Graduating in three years is a wonderful option [only] 
if
 the student has fully maximized the Emory experience to be a competitive candidate for a full-time job or grad school.”


Like Simon, many students credit high tuition costs as incentive for graduating early. According to the College Board, the cost of tuition and fees for private, four-year institutions 
 for the 2013-2014 school year, while out-of-state tuition for public, four-year schools 
.


Rosa Ilyayeva, a December graduate from Emory, says saving a semester of tuition served as a major selling point for getting her parents on board. She is using what would have been her last semester to work before starting graduate school. While she initially worried that taking a break would disrupt her motivation, she now believes a semester off is exactly what she needs.


“It’s a good way to refresh and be motivated when you actually enter the [graduate school] program,” says Ilyayeva, “Grad school is so expensive. You really want to be sure that that’s what you want to do before you take out loans and invest so much time and energy into a program.”


This trend has reached other schools throughout the country. Ari Shifman, a December Tulane graduate, took a full course load each semester in order to spend what would have been his last semester traveling before entering the workforce. He plans to travel through Spain, Portugal, and Eastern Asia with a fellow early graduate and hopes the trip provides a sense of clarity.


“I want to augment my formal education with a cultural understanding,” says Shifman. “I want to find myself, figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life now that I’ve graduated.”


But that’s not to say this trend has hit every school. Ronit Joselevitz, a senior at the University of Texas in Austin, is taking an extra semester to graduate and says this is not uncommon. She says she knows many other students, including her two roommates, who won’t graduate until December 2015.


Joselevitz blames the large number of university requirements for making it difficult to finish in four years. While these requirements vary from major to major, Joselevitz says she would have needed to take six to seven classes per semester to finish on time, even with summer classes.


“I was doing this and killing myself,” says Joselevitz, who is spending the extra semester working on her fashion portfolio. “So I decided it was better to enjoy my time in college.”.


But Simon can’t imagine waiting another semester to graduate. He’s eager to get to Los Angeles and start his dream job.


“I’m getting in when most college graduates are getting in six months later,” says Simon. “I’ll have that experience, I’ll have that edge, and that’s something that’s really valuable.”
