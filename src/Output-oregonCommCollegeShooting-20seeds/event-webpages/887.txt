Most college students wouldn’t consider a trip to Europe essential to their education.
 
But
 
 believed experiences like it were key in maximizing her college experience.


After using some of the $90,000 college tuition fund given to her by her grandparents for things like a trip to Europe and back-to-school clothes, Kim spent the entirety of the fund within three years. The rising senior says she will now owe $10,000 in tuition per semester. And she isn’t sure how she’s going to pay.

Kim – whose last name wasn’t revealed – went on an Atlanta radio show called 
 to address the issue.


“Years ago, my grandparents set up a college fund for me, which was amazing. And I haven’t been very good with my budget for school,” she said in the 
 of the show. “The first payment for my senior year just arrived and I don’t have the money basically.”


The three hosts of the show proceeded to advise her to tell her parents and ask for a loan from them.


Kim later appeared on a 
of the talk show, informing the show’s hosts that her parents didn’t have the money. Her father, she says, “chuckled” when he heard about her situation.


“Basically, they said there was nothing they could do to help me,” Kim says.


Kim proceeded to tell the hosts her 
 for her and taught her how to budget.


“Maybe they should have taught me how to budget a little bit more carefully,” she said. “They never sat me down and had a real serious talk about it.”

The hosts of the show then advised Kim to get the funds by borrowing from the bank. This led to a 
in which Kim discussed her experience going to the bank.


She filled out the paperwork, but was told that she would need to pay down the loan each month and get her parents to co-sign since she had no collateral. Kim proceeded to ask her parents, but they had reservations.


“They won’t give me an answer because they asked me the same thing [as the bank]: how I’m going to pay the loan back,” Kim said.


When asked if she had ever considered getting a part-time job, Kim answered, “No, I didn’t,” because she’s a full-time student and didn’t plan to work during college.


When asked about whether she could work a job in the school cafeteria, Kim replied, “
”


But she eventually gave in. Her parents promised to co-sign the loan if she got a job.






Wow. We're impressed. Starting to see a turnaround in Kim. She's taking responsibility…and is looking for a job!

“I know they’re trying to teach me a lesson and ‘blah blah blah’ and character building but, like, I hope they realize that this could have such a negative effect on my grades and as a person,” she 
. “I won’t be focused on my studies. I have to work at least 15 hours a week.”

Despite Kim’s concerns, studies have shown that nearly four out of five — or 
 — of students work at least part-time, clocking approximately 19 hours a week.


Many took to Twitter to criticize the teen’s spending habits.






 This girl annoys me. I had grants and help from my parents but had to take out loans for grad school.  Time to be a grown-up


— Allyson aTant (@AaTant) 








 I hate this girl so much. Does she know how many people would kill to get FREE MONEY for college?


— Ashley Harris (@AshActually) 








 too much money/privilege. If you dont know how to act responsibly you're the problem. Shows no respect for education or money


— Chloe robinson (@thereal_chloee) 




While many were angered by the Kim’s attitude, her spending habits aren’t rare among college students. “Money Matters On Campus” — a 
 conducted by financial aid company 
 and an education technology company called 
 — examined spending habits among college students. The study revealed insights into how students struggle with spending. While 
 of four-year students report checking their account balances, only 
 of four-year students use budgets.


The study also features a graphic, showing a downtick in students paying credit card bills on time, following a budget to curb spending, and saving 5-10% of income.

“It really underscores the need for more personal finance education, specifically before students even get to college,” Mary Johnson, Higher One’s vice president of financial literacy and student aid policy, previously 
  USA TODAY College. “It’s so important for students to be able to stay in school.”


And for Kim, it seems that this quote rings true.
