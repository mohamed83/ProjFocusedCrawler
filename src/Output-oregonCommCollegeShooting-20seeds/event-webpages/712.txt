When it comes to picking a college, prospective students should keep in mind that some schools aren’t getting the grades they deserve.


A recent 
 from 
Business Insider 
(BI) magazine compiled the 50 most underrated colleges in the country, and found that graduates from some lesser known colleges earn salaries on par with esteemed institutions like Princeton and Yale.


They arrived at the list by comparing “
 in the country with 
, which ranks colleges and universities based on their graduates’ mid-career salaries.” The most underrated schools were those which ranked low on the US News list, but led to higher salaries later on.


“We noticed that a lot of lesser-known tech schools made this list,” said Jennifer Polland, editor of the lists and rankings section at BI. “This makes sense considering that graduates of tech schools tend to go on to make a lot of money.”


Topping the list is the 
 (NJIT), which ranked 149
th
 on the US News list. According to 
Business Insider
, the average mid-career salary of NJIT graduates is $98,000. Additionally, 56% of students are already employed by the time they graduate, a figure 26% higher than the national average.

“NJIT is on a growth trajectory, enrolling nearly 11,000 students as the workforce demand for our student exceeds the supply in NJ, the nation and globally,” said Joel Bloom, president of NJIT.


The school specializes in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors — a trend which can be found throughout the entire list.


Rounding out the top five are the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, Florida Institute of Technology, University of Houston, and Missouri University of Science and Technology, respectively.


COLLEGE FACTUAL: 


Of the top five colleges on the list, three are tech-focused —  and all are known for their STEM programs.


“These majors are among the most challenging disciplines, and are being taught by an excellent faculty,” Bloom said.


Bloom said NJIT has several notable alumni, including Albert Dorman, founding CEO and Chairman of 
AECOM
, the largest engineering, design and technology firm in the world. Ellen Pawlikowski, commander of the US Space and Missile Systems and Richard Sweeney, co-founder of the Keurig
 
single coffee brewing system, also graduated from the institute.


“Clearly, we welcome the good news about our alums and their achievements. We repeatedly hear from them about the excellent preparation they received at NJIT for their professional careers,” Bloom said.


While lists and rankings serve to provide prospective students with a general framework from which to start their search, they aren’t necessarily the best way to make a final decision.


COLLEGE FACTUAL: 


“Rankings measure specific criteria, and if a school doesn’t rank highly in a certain category, it may not make a list — but that doesn’t mean that it’s a bad school. It’s just difficult for rankings to encompass every aspect of a college education,” Polland said.


Polland said the 
Business Insider
 team put together the list to highlight schools that may not get much attention in traditional rankings, but still prepare students for successful careers.


“It’s difficult to measure the quality of a school because every student is different and wants different things from college,” Polland said. “It’s such a personal choice, so I think the best way for students to find the right colleges is to do their research, visit the schools and see which one feels right for them.”
