USA TODAY College is proud to debut a summer special — 
At the Intersection
 — a podcast featuring host Jaleesa Jones.


At the Intersection 
will offer a Millennial perspective and deeper dive on the issues that affect marginalized communities, including race, gender and sexuality.


In today’s podcast, Jones and guests Kinfay Moroti of 
The News-Press
 (Fort Myers, Fla.) and Nichelle Smith of USA TODAY examine the church-based tradition of swift, Christ-like forgiveness in the wake of the massacre at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C.
