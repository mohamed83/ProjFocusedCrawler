Transferring colleges is no simple task, especially if you’re also relocating.


Not only do you have to decide on a transfer school, 
, and then get in, but you also have to undergo a complete life transformation. You have to find a place to live, adapt to a new city, find new friends, adjust to a new school and get used to a different environment. Thankfully, some new companies and websites are stepping up to make that transition simpler.


Here are five services and websites you should know about if you’re transferring to a school in a new city.


1. RentComfy.com


 is a must-browse for transfer students who are relocating.


The website specifically targets college students. This is useful because unlike non-student housing, student housing is often booked months in advance. Also, students have a unique set of housing preferences which non-students may not have have, such as proximity to campus, lower costs and a single room instead of an entire apartment.


RentComfy.com is simple to use on the Web or on your phone. You just create a profile, let the site’s algorithm match you by your preferences and then browse housing in your new area. Property managers can also see you and reach out one time if it’s a good match. The service is available to students at every American college and is free.


2. Amazon


 is brilliant for the relocating transfer student for a variety of reasons.


When you move, you’re probably not going to want to schlep all your housewares with you, especially if you’re flying to your new city. So you’re going to want to buy a lot of things Amazon offers like bedding, appliances, furniture, kitchen products and so forth. You might just to decide to buy all this at a local store, but with Amazon you can price compare without wasting a drop of gas. Plus, if you’re moving without a vehicle, it will be nice to have everything delivered.

3. SimpleBills


 is a service both transfer students and non-transfer students alike can benefit from.


This website promises to make paying utility bills simpler, by working with utility providers, facilitating splitting the bills with your roommates and reminding everyone about the bills via phone and e-mail. You can even set up automatic payments through the site, despite the bill varying each month.


This is ideal if you’re living with new roommates (which you probably will be, since you’re new to town) and don’t want to deal with the stress of everyone paying their bills on time.


4. Meetup.com


There are many ways to make friends as transfer student, such as student clubs or in your 
. But if you want to find people into exactly what you’re into, you need to check out 
.


Meetup, if you haven’t heard, helps like-minded folks set up meetups. It’s like a playdate for grownups, but with specific interests in mind. You’ll find meetups for people who get together to kayak or discuss dream interpretation. There’s probably even a meetup for someone into taking photos while jogging, like Zooey Deschanel’s character in “Yes Man.”


You’ll surely make new friends by joining a group or two or three on Meetup.com, perhaps making the move to the new city less daunting.

5. GetBellhops.com


You’re new to town and might not have anyone local to help you move. Even if your parents drove down with you, you may need a little more help. Maybe you also can’t afford the typical movers’ prices. This is why 
 is so crucial to the transfer student.


Bellhops sets you up with local employees (students like yourself) who will help you move into an apartment, small house or condo at $40 an hour (an hour and a half max). They have employees in more than 130 cities and you even get to see the people helping you move ahead of time via their profile. You also get charged in 15 minute increments, to ensure that you never get ripped off.


According to the Bellhops website, “We don’t consider ourselves ‘movers’, we’re just friends that help you move.” So you may make some new friends from your college in the process. Double score!


In the 21st century, with the Internet and abundance of resources, starting over is simpler than ever. It’s never easy, but it’s as simple as it can be, especially if you use any of these five websites during the process.
