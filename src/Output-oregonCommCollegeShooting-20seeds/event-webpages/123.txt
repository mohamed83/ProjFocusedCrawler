ROSEBURG, Ore. -- As we learn more about the Umpqua Community College shooter, we are also learning more about men and women who stood up to protect their classmates.


All brave souls have a calling. Some wear badges.


“We do know we have two heroic officers who went into the building within minutes and exchanged gunfire with the suspect,” Douglas Co. Sheriff John Hanlin said in a press conference Thursday (October, 1
st
, 2015).


Some brave souls simply step up when their heart tells them to.


“He could have very easily died,” said Wanda Mintz, the victim’s aunt. “I really think that if he wasn't such a strong, young guy, he may have died.”


30-year-old Chris Mintz is in the hospital suffering 5 gunshot wounds and two broken legs, but he’s more of a hero than a victim. Chris telling family before he entered surgery how he got those bullet wounds.


“Tries to block the door to keep the gunman from coming in gets shot three times hits the floor looks up at gunman and says its my son's birthday today gets shot two more times,” Wanda Mintz described.


Chris is from North Carolina. Thursday was his fourth day of class at UCC. His family says after standing up to the gunman to protect his class mates, he was rushed to a local hospital.


Family members said both of Mintz’s legs are broken and he will have to relearn to walk, but he is now recovering and expected to survive. No vital organs were hit.


Mintz has been in the military for at least 10 years and was in Oregon, primarily, to raise his son, according to his family.


“His vital signs are OK he's going to have to learn to walk again but he walked away with his life and that's more than so many other people did,” said Ariana Earnhardt, Chris’ cousin.
