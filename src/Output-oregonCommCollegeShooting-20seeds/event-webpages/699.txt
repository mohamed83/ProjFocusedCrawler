(By John Raoux, AP)


Police monitor the campus at the University of Central Florida after explosive devices were found by authorities investigating the apparent suicide of a student in a dorm.


University of Central Florida student Chad Erwin hesitated for a few minutes when the fire alarm in his dorm, Tower 1, sounded shortly after midnight March 18.


He and several other students had gone out a few hours earlier for St. Patrick’s Day.


“I thought someone was drunk and pulled the fire alarm,” Erwin said.


But the situation was far worse.


James Oliver Seevakumaran, 30, a former UCF student facing eviction, was found dead in his third-floor dorm in Tower 1 after committing suicide. His room contained a barrage of weaponry, including a handgun, tactical assault rifle and backpack containing four IEDS.


, Seevakumaran had a large-scale “timeline of violence” planned.


Erwin, a junior radio-television broadcast major, lives on the fifth floor of Tower 1. When he finally went outside with several roommates, he was immediately met by a police officer. UCF police told students they could not stay in the dorm, as investigators examined the scene.


“At one point we went back to the building and saw the FBI,” he said. “That was when it really hit, it was quite intimidating.”


Sophomore hospitality major Justin Love, who also lives in Tower 1, saw Seevakumaran several months earlier at Kyoto Sushi & Grill, an on-campus sushi bar within walking distance of his dorm, where Seevakumaran worked as a cashier.


“He served me once, I didn’t think anything of it until I saw his face,” Love said. “I said like, two words to him.”


Freshman hospitality major Brandon Fisher had been asleep for about two hours when the alarm went off. He was “horrified” after the details about the shooter’s plan came out. 
 that Seevakumaran might have initially pulled the fire alarm to lure students out of their rooms.


“We could have been dead,” said Fisher. “It’s so scary that what we did is what he wanted us to do.”


A week later, the 500 students housed in UCF’s Tower 1, a co-ed dorm, still struggle to cope with what happened — and what might have been.


Fisher and his roommate thanked Seevakumaran’s roommate, Arabo Babakhani, over the weekend for making the initial 911 call that alerted authorities.


And Erwin, along with several roommates on his floor, has vowed to stay attentive to future fire alarms.


“That was one of the first things we discussed,” he said. “We’re all still having trouble sleeping though.”
