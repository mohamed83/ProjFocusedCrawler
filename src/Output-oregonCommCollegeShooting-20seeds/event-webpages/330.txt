King 5/Gannett


A 26-year-old male identified as Aaron R. Ybarra was in custody late Thursday after a shooting on the campus of a Christian university in Seattle that left one person dead and three others with injuries, police said.


Earlier, police said a man — not believed to be a student — with a shotgun opened fire inside a building on the campus of Seattle Pacific University.


Seattle police said during a news conference late Thursday that the man in custody would be booked under a charge of investigation for murder.


A student guard subdued the gunman as he reloaded.


A wounded man in his 20s was pronounced dead at Harborview Medical Center about 90 minutes after the 3:30 p.m. PT shootings at Seattle Pacific University, an evangelical Christian school north of downtown. 


A 20-year-old woman was critically wounded and was in surgery Thursday evening, the hospital said.


Two men, one 24 and the other 22, were listed in satisfactory condition, one with a gunshot wound. The hospital did not specify the other man’s injuries.


Police did not say whether the gunman was among the injured.


“The actions of the subject in this case do not define Seattle Pacific University nor the city of Seattle,” McDonagh said. “The actions of the students and staff on site, those are the things that define Seattle Pacific University.”


STORY: 


Seattle Police Capt. Chris Fowler said the first calls about the shooting came in at 3:23 p.m. Seattle time and police responded four minutes later.


The shooter began firing a shotgun in the foyer or lobby of Otto Miller Hall and when he paused to reload was taken down by a student guard, who pepper-sprayed him, Fowler said. Once on the ground, other students piled on and kept the shooter pinned down until police arrived, he said.


“The shooter began to reload his shotgun and a student that is the building monitor inside the hall confronted the shooter, was able to subdued the individual, and once on the ground, other students jumped on top of him and were able to pin the shooter to the ground until police arrived,” said Fowler.
