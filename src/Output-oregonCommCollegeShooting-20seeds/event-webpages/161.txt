One Twitter user who was a witness wrote that Mercer lined up students in a classroom and asked what religion each person was. Those who answered Christian were shot in the head. Those who answered with a different religion were shot in the legs.

I was born and raised in Roseburg, I went to Winchester Elementary. A couple miles away from where the shooting took place. 10 lives have been lost.. 7 more injured.. and all you sickos care about is attacking eachother. About gun laws, religion, and just hating on eachother in general. Have some respect for all those effected by this. Stop giving this mad man terrorist a name. Don’t give him a voice by using this as political propaganda to change laws or anything else. And don’t use this as an opportunity to be keyboard warriors against one another. Have some respect for the dead. Like you would if this had happened in YOUR backyard.
