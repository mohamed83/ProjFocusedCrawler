The Department of Education’s 
 released its annual list of the most expensive colleges in the United States this week.


The lists focus on the “highest (top 5%) and lowest (bottom 10%) academic year charges” for a variety of two- and four-year colleges and universities, based on their reported data.


There are some hefty price tags among private schools and some surprisingly high numbers among public colleges. Another interesting list is the most expensive net price schools, which Transparency Center describes as “cost of attendance minus grant and scholarship aid.”


Check out a few categories below and visit the Center’s 
 for a whole bunch more lists.
