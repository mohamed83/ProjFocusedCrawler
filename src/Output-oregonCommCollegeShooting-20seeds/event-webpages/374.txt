I didn’t go to a four-year university right out of high school and that’s okay. I’ve learned so much at my community college and, if anything, I feel much more prepared than I was at 18 to embark on a journey to a university.


Thinkstock


Here are five lessons and tips I’ve acquired while at Moorpark College that made my first two years of college that much better.


1. Avoid using the ’13th grade’


My psychology teacher in high school said it best: “Don’t treat junior college like the thirteenth grade” and he’s right. You don’t necessarily have to want to transfer. Maybe you want to get your AA and that’s it. Just know that you are there for a reason and keep striving toward your goal. It seems like school goes on for forever sometimes, but your time in community college will go by quicker than you think if you keep working toward a goal every day — you don’t want to be stuck.


2. Keep an open mind


Even if you don’t know what you want to major in or you have no idea what school you want to go to, be as open-minded as possible to all the different classes and programs available to you.


Often times, in the midst of trying to complete General Ed requirements last year, I found that my most rewarding classes, like speech, sociology and philosophy, had nothing to do with my major (English), but they helped me narrow down my search for a minor.


3. Push yourself, don’t let anyone push you


When I tell people I chose to go to community college first, a majority of the time, the response is positive: “Oh, that’s smart!” or “Oh, that saves money!” but other times, especially when I say I want to transfer to schools like Stanford or University of San Francisco, I get: “Well, it would’ve been easier to just go straight to a university. You’re just wasting your time.”


Because I am in a wheelchair and I get tired really easily, I had to make sure I could handle the course load and longer school days. I get a lot of, “Well, I would’ve pushed harder and not been so lazy.” Here’s my advice to anyone, disability or not, who has come up against comments like this:


Your journey is your own. If you have a goal, you’ll find a way to achieve it and don’t stop until you do. Don’t let anyone’s comments deter you and stay focused on yourself. Tell yourself you can do it and you will.


4. Volunteer and contribute to campus


Your time at community college is just as important as your time at any university. I’ve found some people I have met don’t see it as beneficial to be involved in any extra-curricular programs just because it’s “community college”. That’s totally not true. Join different organizations and participate in sports. Hey, you can even start your own club! Look into the different departments and see what they might offer. You could end up meeting interesting people and finding a passion you never knew you had.


5. Going to community college does not mean you are stupid


I made this my fifth point because certain people that I’ve met over the last two years have equated intelligence with what post-secondary path you take. Like I said before, your journey is yours and yours alone. When I first decided that I didn’t want to go to a university right away, I was at that point in high school where all of my friends were getting acceptance letters from their top schools, and when they asked me where I was going, I always felt inadequate with my answer. Honestly, I wasn’t inadequate at all. And neither are you. Be proud of yourself and the path you have chosen to take, and know that you are intelligent.
