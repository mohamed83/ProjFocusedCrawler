Millennials do 
, you know. The Center for Leadership and Service at the University of Florida recently hosted an event called Summer Plunge, a one-day service project that allows students to participate in various community service projects throughout Gainesville, Fla.


Students woke up bright and early on Saturday, July 19 to gather at the university’s stadium — from there, they were separated into groups representing different service projects.


A group of students spent their Saturday morning and afternoon weeding and maintaining a local botanical garden.


Take a look at their volunteerism below.
