While hundreds of thousands of anti-abortion rights activists participated in last week’s 
 at the National Mall in Washington D.C., the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation with a 242-179 vote to ban federal funding for abortions .


Lisa Jankowski, president of the Michigan State University’s College Republicans, attended this year’s march, which marked the anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 1973 
 decision to legalize abortion. Jankowski says she was pleased with the outcome of the vote.

“People who are pro-life in general, like me, are against federal funding for abortions,” Jankowski says. “So not having to pay for something that we don’t support is a very positive thing.”


Other students, such as Emily Gillingham, president of the MSU’s chapter of Law Students for Reproductive Justice, didn’t see the House’s decision as a positive one.


“This isn’t the first time we’ve seen anti-choice politicians restrict reproductive choice by denying access to this medical procedure to poor women,” says Gillingham. “And it certainly won’t be the last.”


Instead of focusing on jobs or the economy, which Gillingham says politicians are expected to work on, they’re attacking women’s health.


But that bill wasn’t the only abortion-related proposal brought to the table. A push to ban 
, which occur after 20 weeks of a pregnancy, was tabled.


“From my understanding, the bill would have denied women, who were impregnated by a rapist, an abortion after 20 weeks if they did not file a police report,” says Brianna Shamsuddoha, president of MSU’s College Democrats. “This is yet another attack on rape victims and women’s reproductive rights by the extreme right of the Republican Party.”


Gillingham says this type of abortion ban would prove burdensome for college women.


“A restriction on the right to obtain an abortion like this means a race against the clock to scrape together the money for the procedure and schedule it around classes,” Gillingham says.

While she was happy with the House’s decision, Jankowski says she, along with the others who attended the annual “March for Life,” was upset that the proposal banning “late-term” abortions was pushed aside.


“This year was my sixth march,” Jankowski says. “This cause means a lot to me and it takes a lot of fundraising to get there every year, but I feel like that’s just where I’m supposed to be and I will continue going for as long as I have to.”
