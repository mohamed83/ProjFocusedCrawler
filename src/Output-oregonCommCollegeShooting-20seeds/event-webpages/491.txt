Going home for the holidays can be a strange experience for a graduate student.


Often times, you’re broke and deprived of a relatively luxurious life of good food, stability and 
. You may be studying something so obscure or technical that it’s practically inaccessible or irrelevant to the general public. And while many of your similarly-aged siblings and friends have started their careers or started families, you’re stuck in classes, maybe even living in the dorms or a small apartment.


These common facts set grad students up for an interesting holiday experience. Here’s how to manage visiting family for Christmas, or whatever holiday your family celebrates, as a 
 or Ph.D. student.


Gift giving and receiving


Gift giving can be difficult if you’re a poor grad student, but you have a couple of choices.


You could follow the route of Travis Trickey, a master’s student in communication studies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Trickey worked 
 before Christmas so he could afford to buy gifts for his family.


“Come Christmas I was rolling in the dough,” said Trickey, who’s about to graduate. “And by rolling, I mean I was able to afford some small gifts for the members of my family.”


Or you could go the no gifts or few gifts route, like Sara Harvey often did. Harvey, who studied graduate-level theology at Bob Jones University, only bought gifts for nieces and nephews.


“I was poor on time and energy,” Harvey said. “So I just warned my family that I probably would only be buying the kids gifts.”


As far as receiving gifts, Harvey would “jokingly” ask for money (quotes intended), but often received gift cards instead. Trickey also received a lot of gift cards from family for Christmas, which he said were his life lines in grad school.


“Some days just get so bad that you need a gift card to your favorite restaurant so you can chow down and drown your troubles,” Trickey said.


If you want to present yourself as cool and collected, you may want to buy gifts and not ask for much. If you’re okay showing your desperation, you can buy few or no gifts and ask for as much as possible.


Talking about your research to family


Whether it’s a research project, a thesis or a dissertation, what you’re studying in grad school is probably painfully specific. Relatives unfamiliar with how grad school works may regrettably ask you about your studies when you see them over the holidays.


For Trickey, he made the mistake at first of going into way too much detail about his professional paper, which was a descriptive analysis of a political event.


“Usually I’d get into the part about what a descriptive analysis is and the elements I was looking for, and typically that was right about the time they would cut in and say, ‘Look, I was just trying to be nice. I don’t know what you’re talking about and all I am thinking about is getting some more pie,'” Trickey said.


Discernment is key when it comes to explaining your research to family during the holidays. Perhaps come up with an elevator speech and see where it goes from there. Or redirect the conversation to how delicious the turkey is.


Christmas dinner


Grad students have two possible routes in regards to eating Christmas dinner with the family.


You could do what Harvey did, which was hide the fact that eating substantial meals isn’t a regular life event and hide the aggravated food anxieties.


“I snacked on pretzels tucked away in my suitcase to alleviate my nervous anticipation for family dinner,” Harvey said.


Or you could do what Trickey did: not hide your desperate desire for good food and eat everything, even the uneaten food on family members’ plates.


“My family came up with the name ‘the garbage disposal’ for me,” Trickey said.


It’s all about what image you want to portray. If you come to regret your decision later about how you conducted yourself at the dinner table, it’s okay. There’s always next year and your family is kind of stuck with you for life.


In every decision you make about how to approach discussing research, gift giving and receiving, and Christmas dinner, keep in mind: You’re not alone. Grad students everywhere are trying to figure out how to navigate the holidays and just life in general during this strange phase of life.


And who knows: Maybe Santa will fill your stocking with enough gift cards to keep you fed until graduation. A Christmas miracle, indeed.
