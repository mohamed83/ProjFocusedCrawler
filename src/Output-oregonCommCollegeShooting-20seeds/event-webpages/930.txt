“When I was in high school, I had a 4.0 GPA, a 33 on the ACT, 2,000 on the SAT, I was salutatorian and I was worried I would not be able to go to college,” Raymond Partolan says.


Partolan, an undocumented immigrant and the former student body president of Mercer University in Macon, Ga., was addressing a rally on Monday at the University of Georgia protesting the ban on undocumented students from the top five public universities in the state.


Georgia has one of the strictest prohibitions in the nation against undocumented students attending its top public universities, along with neighboring states Alabama and South Carolina, 
.


Protest leaders look forward to May 6, the scheduled date for the opening hearing of the Georgia Dreamers Alliance’s lawsuit against the University System of Georgia Board of Regents. This lawsuit claims that the prohibition of undocumented students violates the Board of Regents’ own policy, which guarantees in-state tuition to any Georgia student who graduates with “legal presence.” Immigration activists assert this would include many undocumented students who arrived in the United States at a young age.


The rally began when nearly 100 demonstrators assembled at The Arch, the historic symbol of UGA, and marched to university President Jere Morehead’s office. A delegation of activists entered the building to speak with Morehead. One of those activists, Lucino Gopar, says “he’s afraid to say something that will affect the university or his position. He’s not stupid.”


Morehead released a statement saying he “appreciates the variety of perspectives shared through dialogue on a college campus” and promises to “convey those concerns to the [University System of Georgia Board of] Regents.”


Gathering underneath a building façade inscribed with the name “Shakespeare,” students protested and waved signs stating, “Education, not segregation.” Undocumented activists such as Alejandro Galeana Salinas hoped students at UGA would “see us and what we’re doing, what we’re representing: an ongoing struggle against oppression.”


Galeana Salinas demonstrated his passion in the confrontation when university police cleared the stairs of the administration building to allow entrance and exit.


The inconvenience did not go unnoticed by Davis Mastin, a student at UGA. “I’m a student worker here and I couldn’t get to work. Usually they don’t open the back door, but I’m glad they made accommodations. I got to help pay my way through school,” he says.


Reactions to the protest from students nearby were mixed. “You should go through the process of legalization before you consume a public good,” says Casey Tuggle, a junior political science and social work student at UGA.


Yet according to Adam Cooper, a UGA senior majoring in philosophy,, “If we’re going to be given anything in life, it should be the opportunity to get an education.”


“It’s us lifting our voices. We’re tired of staying in the dark,” says Joanna Nihart, an undocumented student and young mother who worries about raising her daughter in a state she believes remains segregated.


Appeals to Georgia’s segregated past were a theme of the rally. Speakers at the rally in English and Spanish noted the irony of UGA’s celebration of 50 years of desegregation and sang songs associated with the civil rights movement like “We shall not be moved.” Other chants included “Shame on Georgia,” “Coward” (addressed to Morehead) and the preamble to the United States constitution.


The atmosphere grew tense as protester Valentina Garcia tearfully requested support from African-American police officers, shouting, “You, sir, you’ve been oppressed.” Other voices in the crowd compared the officers’ actions to a “stand in the schoolhouse door,” referring to the infamous grandstanding of segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace.


Many of the protesters were students at Freedom University, a non-accredited collegiate-level institution . Established by academics sympathetic to undocumented students who could not receive a public education in Georgia, volunteer teachers offer collegiate courses but are not able to offer degrees.


Freedom University students attend classes at the Martin Luther King Sr. Center at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the home church of Martin Luther King.


“The inspiration comes from Southern freedom schools, the idea that education is liberty,” says Dr. Laura Emiko Soltis, professor at Freedom University. She notes that “The same five universities that banned [undocumented] students are the exact same five that Atlanta [civil rights] student movement was banned from in 1960.”


Some students, such as first-year Management and Information Systems major Tifara Brown, joined the protest and took a more prosaic approach to the issue. Anticipating upcoming exams, she says, “Students worry about their tests, but at least you have the right to be stressed about that.”
