Ten people were killed and another 7 injured Thursday when a gunman opened fire in a classroom at Umpqua Community College in southern Oregon.


On Thursday night, hundreds of people gathered in Roseburg, Ore., to remember the victims and, on Friday morning, people braced for the release of the names of those killed.


On Thursday, the shooting prompted a visibly frustrated President Obama to renew his calls for more gun regulation.


Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said the gunman was shot and killed during an exchange of gunfire with officers around 10:30 a.m. Pacific time on Thursday.


Hanlin refused to name the killer, saying, “I will not give him the credit he probably wanted … for this cowardly act. You will never hear me mention his name.”


A federal law enforcement source identified the gunman as a local 26-year-old Oregon man, Chris Mercer.


UPDATE:


Umpqua Community College posted on Twitter that it will be closed until Monday, Oct. 5. Student activities for the weekend have been cancelled.




The school is one of many nationwide that bans the possessions of guns on campuses.


“Possession, use, or threatened use of firearms (including but not limited to BB guns, air guns, water pistols, and paint guns) … is prohibited on college property,” 
 Umpqua’s safety and security policy.


The state’s laws on guns, however, are nebulous and conflicting: A September 2011 decision by the Oregon Court of Appeals overturned a ban on concealed weapons on campus, effectively legalizing the possession of concealed guns — with the appropriate permit — on college campuses. The next March, Oregon’s state board of higher education unanimously approved a policy banning guns from classrooms, buildings, residence halls and events, 
 to the National Conference of State Legislatures.


Essentially, concealed weapons are legal on Oregon college grounds — except inside the buildings.

The identity of Umqua’s shooter has still not been confirmed, but USA TODAY reported the shooting took place inside of a classroom.


“We are deeply saddened by these events, and our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by the shooting,” the American Association of Community Colleges said in an emailed statement. “These types of occurrences are not unheard of at community colleges. We are committed to supporting on-campus safety and security measures at our colleges, with a priority emphasis on prevention whenever possible. … We stand with our friends at Umpqua Community College and offer them our full support.”


Twitter users reached out Thursday to express their grief for the victims.






My thoughts are with the families and victims of today's tragedy.
