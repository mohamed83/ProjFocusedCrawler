Living in the dorms as a freshman is part of the ultimate college experience, as defined by our culture.


But what if you didn’t live in the dorms as a freshman and now are transferring to a college as a sophomore or junior? If you live in the dorms at this point, you’ll be 
 than a lot of other students in the dorms. Could this still be a good idea and part of the ultimate college experience?


Whether or not transfer students should live in the dorms comes packed with a lot of considerations.


Staying in the dorms



Even if you’re already in your early twenties, living in the dorms could still benefit you.


For Greg Orlando, who transferred from Austin Peay State University to the University of Nevada, Reno as a 20-year-old junior, living in the dorms was mostly a positive experience.


“The benefit to living in the dorms was that I didn’t have to sign a complex and long lease that apartments require,” said Orlando, who graduated in 2009 with a 
. “If I were to meet a few people and move out later on, I could do so with ease. Also, living in the dorms canceled out any notion to rush out and purchase furniture.”


Beyond the ease of moving into the dorms versus moving into an apartment or house, Orlando also saw many social benefits to living in the dorms.


“The dorms provide a community around you of similar-aged and -minded people,” Orlando said. “The dorms almost automatically line up acquaintances and potential friends.”


But being an older student in the dorms did prove tough at times for Orlando. Whereas he was serious about his studies and fixed on finishing college, some students in the dorms weren’t always on the same page. This led to sometimes dealing with noise and a 
 and privacy, which at times distracted him from his studies.


Ultimately, if you’re a transfer student looking at living in the dorms, it comes down to this: What are your reasons for wanting to live in the dorms? To meet new people? That should happen in the dorms and in college in general. To be conveniently and closely located to your classes? You could do that in the dorms or in a close-by apartment or house. To avoid the hassles of renting an apartment or house? This is perhaps the best aspect of choosing the dorms.


Some schools have upper-classmen dorms or on-campus housing for upper-classmen. Look into that as well, and know the benefits and risks of dorm life, as Orlando clearly did ahead of time.


Living off-campus


Living off-campus as a transfer student seems to be the most frequent choice but comes with its own sets of pros and cons.


Kelly Balistreri, who transferred from West Valley Community College to the University of San Francisco as a junior, feels like she missed out on making that core group of friends many freshman make in the dorms.


“Lacking that experience made it hard for me to make friends,” said Balistreri, who graduated in 2009 with a bachelor’s degree in communication studies. “I didn’t connect with the other students that had been going there since freshman year and only made friends with other transfer students. I think it also would have been an easier transition from living at home to living in the dorms rather than living in an apartment.”


She now advises students — both freshman and transfer students — to live in the dorms.


“It will make them feel like they belong quicker, almost like a rite of passage,” Balistreri said.


This is not to say living off campus didn’t have its benefits for Balistreri. Living in an apartment with a friend, she enjoyed not having to share a room and having more space, privacy and options with cooking than she would have had if she lived in the dorms.


If you choose to live off campus (or if your college doesn’t allow upper-classmen to live in the dorms), then expect to buy furniture for your apartment or house and a parking pass if you can’t walk to campus. But also expect to potentially enjoy more space and privacy than you may get in the dorms. If you choose this route, you’ll need to make a concerted effort to find ways to meet other students, so you can try to make up for the potential social loss of not living in the dorms.


Whatever you decide when it comes to where to live as a transfer student, make sure you’ve considered everything. If you have, you’ll be more confident in your decision and more prone to making a wise choice.
