More than 300 applicants sent thousands of tweets in an attempt to tweet their way to an internship with Campbell Mithun.


For many overachieving college students, fitting a résumé on one page is a challenge. But trying to sell all of your qualities for a job in just 13 tweets at 140 characters per tweet? That was the challenge applicants to “The Lucky 13” — a summer internship program run by advertising and marketing agency Campbell Mithun — faced.


More than 300 applicants sent thousands of tweets in an attempt to tweet their way to an internship with Campbell Mithun. Mark Manalaysay, Savannah College of Art and Design junior and recipient of the internship, explained each applicant was limited to only 13 tweets, all of which needed to include two hashtags: One was #L13, which identified them as part of the competition, and the other the area in which the intern wanted to work.


“It was essentially 13 open-ended cover letters to try to go and get an interview,” he explained.


After the more than 300 applicants sent out thousands of tweets, the company narrowed the competition down to 32 finalists, who were then interviewed either in person or via Skype.


Ultimately, six interns were selected.


Vince Koci, University of Minnesota senior was one of the lucky six and considered the whole experience “pretty surreal.”


“I was beside myself, naturally,” he said. “But the fact that we weren’t supposed to let the news slip for another two weeks is really what made it dream-like. Certain sleep-deprived evenings sometimes had me wondering if the whole thing was actually happening.”


Debbie Fischer, human resources manager at Campbell Mithun, explained that the competition not only allowed the applicants to explore their creative side but also was a way to keep up with modern times.


“We had a far greater reach,” she said. “And it gave us the opportunity to see the individual’s creativity.”


“By far, this was the most fun I had applying for anything,” Koci said. “And that includes a Power Ranger fan club application when I was 7 with a color-by-numbers Red Ranger on it.”


Twitter tips from the winning interns:


1. Be yourself


“Not to be clichéd, but be yourself,” Koci said. “Gimmicks generally seemed to fall flat, as least amongst the other competitors.”


You wouldn’t lie on a résumé, so be honest to yourself when you’re tweeting as well. Besides, with the challenge of a 140-character limit, it’s much easier to just be yourself and embrace it than to try too hard.


Vince showed his personality with jokes, like in this tweet of his: “People tell me I have a dry sense of humor. I tell them, ‘Yes I do.’ #CMcr8 #L13”


2. Show personality


“I went with the philosophy that if a tweet made me laugh, then it was good to go,” Koci said. “The theory being that that would be the only way to portray my personality via Twitter.”


Show your potential bosses and your competitors what makes you stand out. Résumés and websites may all start to blur together, but Twitter is an excellent way to show how you separate yourself from the crowd.


Vince was able to have fun with the other potential interns as well with tweets like, “[I] started seeing #L13 one day before Valentine’s. Awkward. Do I get it something? #CMcr8”


3. Establish your presence!


“Try to find your voice,” Manalaysay said. “It made me stand out from all the other [applicants].”


Twitter is a perfect opportunity to showcase yourself without taking anything too seriously. Make sure you are distinguishable among your peers without just trying to advertise yourself as a business.


For example, Manalaysay tweeted, “Why major in advertising? Christina Hendricks … and I love coming up with ideas and solving problems. Mostly Christina though. #L13 #CMcr8”
