Philip Gibert received no funds from his family to help with college costs and had no idea how to navigate the college application processes. This led to a difficult transition into university life, poor grades and a stressful college experience.


Asking for help changed his college pathway. Instead of an undergraduate career filled with challenges, it was filled with campus involvement.


First-generation students — 
 – make up nearly one third of undergraduates. Various reports and research concludes that those in this group enter college with minimal preparedness and are often less likely to engage with others in a university setting.


“The biggest challenge I faced being a first-generation college student was definitely doing everything on my own,” says Samantha Metz, a Penn State senior. “My parents had no idea what actually went into applying to colleges — making college visits, and taking the SAT.”


First-generation students are often underrepresented, according to reports from The , and only 54% whose parents obtained only high school diplomas go on to attend a university.


This gap in enrollment is where bridge programs come into play at universities nationwide. These programs – which are offered at 
, the 
, and the 
, among others — are designed specifically to advise first-year students. All share similar goal: to provide first-generation students a head start in college and ease the transition.


George Mason University’s 
 was created to “enhance the recruitment, engagement and retention of first-generation college students.”


at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill began in 1980 and has since helped first year students “benefit from early exposure to the campus environment.” Students enroll in summer courses, engage in and out of the classroom and connect with university officials.


“Most often, students are the first in their families to attend college or they may have attended high schools that lacked a rigorous college prep curriculum that included Advanced Placement courses,” says Marcus Collins, director of Summer Bridge. “I believe, perhaps, the most important aspect of the summer bridge experience is the opportunity for students to create community.”


Collins says students felt the program gave them an opportunity to prepare for college and find support academically and socially.


Other programs, like the 
“helps low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students find their way to colleges that will serve them well.”

Yolanda Keith, the senior assistant director of admissions and program coordinator of Carolina College Advising Corps, says the organization knows that many prospective first-generation college students are thinking about higher education, but may not have sufficient information.

“We hire recent graduates of our university to help [high school] students navigate financial aid and the college application process,” Keith says.


Although the 
is a national organization, the Carolina College Advising Corps (CCAC) works with more than 10,000 high school students in the state. Advisers of the program go through extensive training to better understand the challenges first-generation students may face.


The national organization works with high schools nationwide to introduce students to university settings and help them “envision themselves as a college student.” Through college bus tours, one-on-one meetings and financial advising, CCAC advisers help high school students find their “best fit” college.


“The goal is to help students match to institutions,” says Keith. “We try to expose students to colleges across the state and nation.”


For many students, supplemental help bridges are a rewarding experience.


“I believe that it’s important for universities to secure first-generation programing and assistance to help manage the lives of these students who aren’t like everyone else,” Gibert says.


Metz notes that Penn State has a transition program, the 
, that many of her friends have participated in. But, as a student who elected not to attend, she believes that those programs aren’t necessary for a first-generation student’s success.


LEAP is offered to first-year students who “want a smooth transition into life at a large campus.” Participating students take small classes together, have a mentor available to them and live in a common residence area.


But Metz thinks a universal guide on how to complete various general college-related tasks should be made readily available to any soon-to-be undergraduate, particularly first-generation students.


“I think it’s extremely beneficial for universities to provide step-by-step tutorials for all the major things that go in enrolling into a college,” Metz says.


Keith has received positive feedback about the CCAC program from those who have participated. She emphasizes the importance of collaborative efforts between students and universities.


“Through these bridge programs and first-year initiatives, we can help secure the futures of families who will be expecting their first person in their family to carry the legacy further with their education,” Gibert says.
