Using an online application, a student goes through pages of generic questions about his or her aptitude, general information and background history.


The time of applying for college is one filled with excitement and stress, but for some, one application question can be even more worrisome if a student has had a run-in with the law.


It’s no secret that universities, especially those that use the 
, typically require applicants to check a box regarding criminal background history. This question has created an ongoing debate as to whether universities thoroughly check potential students’ records and if that practice is an ethical deciding factor for admission.


Stemming from an attempt to ensure universal campus safety, the criminal record questions take into account offenses across the board, from minor to felony-level.


a new study that found out of 273 responding institutions, 55% collect and use criminal justice information in the admissions process. Universities can use either self-reporting — most commonly used — or background screening procedures.


Kristina Medlock, student at the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW), agrees with inquiring of criminal records.


“It’s just another way to ensure safety for students, staff and faculty, as well as covering their assets in the event something occurs,” she says.


Although, the questions and responses can only ensure campus safety to an extent. No direct link has been reported between a criminal record and posing a risk to campus, 
.


In 2005 at UNCW, freshman Jessica Faulkner was killed by 20-year-old Curtis Dixon, 
. Faulkner’s parents raised concern that Dixon’s record of Navy discharge and possible expulsion from two other universities were not fact-checked because he did not voluntarily include them on his application.


Brytan Mendes, a soon-to-be college student, tweeted that he does not think that criminal information ties in with the safety of a campus.


“There must be some people who never report and people who stay under the radar,” Mendes says.

 studied bring in additional staff to help evaluate admission for applicants with a record. The problem of discrimination arises when it comes to the decision process as applicants with a record may be just as qualified to succeed in an academic setting, but his or her answer deters acceptance.


In recent years, some universities have petitioned to have screenings removed, 
 A petition on Change.org by Huskies for Fairness requested the removal of criminal history record questions because research showed it promoted institutional racism and did not directly reduce crime.


“By excluding students with a criminal record from our campus community and learning environment, students of color and students from disadvantaged backgrounds are further subjected to the inherent discrimination imposed on them by the criminal justice system,” stated on the online petition.


The University of Washington Provost responded publicly to the petition stating that background checks were not intended to screen out students, but rather determine if an applicant was convicted of a felony-level crime or classified as a sex offender. The application does leave space for applicants to write why they should not be considered a threat to the campus to defend their answer.


New York State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman made an agreement with a few New York schools in 2014, including St. John’s University, that criminal record questions would not be included on college applications.


. “An arrest or police stop that did not result in a conviction, or a criminal record that was sealed or expunged, should not – indeed must not – be a standard question on a college application. Such a question can serve only to discourage New Yorkers from seeking a higher education.”


The Center for Community Alternatives, along with other supporters, recommends that universities stop collecting criminal record information for the purpose of admissions.


Others see it as a preparation for entering the job force where background checks are unavoidable.


“Personally, everyone should get used to it,” Medlock says. “Most employers are now requiring background and drug screenings on employees.”
