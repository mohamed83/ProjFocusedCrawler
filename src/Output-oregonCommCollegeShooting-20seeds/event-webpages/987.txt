So you graduated with a degree in communications or journalism and now you want to be a journalist?


Well before you can be a Woodward or Bernstein, you have to be a Zoey Barnes (minus the Kevin Spacey-induced demise). Editors are eager to hear from motivated applicants with a solid education,and work experience.


So as you build your portfolio and begin the great hunt for employment in a media-driven world, keep these five tips in mind.


1. Understand the market


Know what you want out of your career and navigate your path to get there.


The American Society of Newspaper Editors advises that smaller newspapers offer broader opportunities for beginning reporters. Larger newspapers are typically more interested in entry-level applicants with many internship experiences and specialty reporting skills. Young reporters can benefit from gaining close community contacts and skills working in a smaller news market.


2. Never stop writing


So it’s summer now, the school newspaper isn’t circulating and you have a summer job at a restaurant because …well you’re young and need money. This doesn’t mean you need to put the brakes on your writing.


Newsday
 reporter Bill Bleyer, says that “when editors are looking at resumes and bodies of work, they understand that sometimes you need to work at Friendly’s on the side to pay the bills, but you should always be writing. Freelance for the local paper, update news and events for the town blog, anything. The last thing an editor wants to see on a resume is an extended time gap where you had nothing published.”


3. Be versatile


Don’t limit yourself to just print. Be fluent in your video, editing and web design skills.


Michelle Johnson, online and multimedia journalism professor at Boston University, emphasizes the importance of being well-versed in all aspects of news dissemination. Johnson says, that she has seen students seeking print jobs  get hired for their experience in web design and social media management.


4. Know how to create your resume


Bleyer can’t emphasize enough how different journalism resumes are from a conventional business resume. He stresses to know the difference between an ‘academic’ resume and a ‘working’ resume. Editors are looking for experience.


Bleyer endorses putting your most current work at the top. If you have experience, put the company or organization you worked for first, in bold face (
Newsday, 
Intern/Reporter). After your related experience, then put your education, skills, languages, travel experience, and — of course — keep it to one page.


5. Don’t c
ount out radio


Steven Kalb is a veteran broadcaster and adjunct professor of broadcast journalism at the University of Connecticut. His experience has brought him to know, that “radio news stations are crying for people who can write well.” Radio is a great medium for your skills to be put to good use over the air.
