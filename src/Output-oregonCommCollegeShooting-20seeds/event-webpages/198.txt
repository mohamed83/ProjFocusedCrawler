Police reported Wednesday that two unknown gunmen opened fire in a “targeted incident” on Tuesday night, just a few blocks from the University of Maryland-Baltimore. 
, two men and two women were shot and three died.


One man was pronounced dead and the scene, a second man and woman were taken to a local hospital where the later died and a fourth person — a woman — suffered a minor injury but is in stable condition, according to police.






Shooting: 900 block of Fayette St. 2 males 2 females reported to be shot. Homicide Detectives are investigating. Call 410 396 2100 w/ info


— Baltimore Police (@BaltimorePolice) 




The gunmen 
 emerged from two vans and began shooting around 10:30 to 11 p.m. on Tuesday night.


Reportedly, UMB President, Jay A. Perman, issued a 
 to campus saying that no students were involved and police don’t believe the shooting has any connection to the university.


“When tragedy strikes so close to home, we are all affected by it,” Perman told the 
 “Let me assure you that there is no higher priority than the safety of everyone who works and studies here, as well as the thousands who visit our campus every day.”


“This did not happen on campus and again, there are no ties to the University of Maryland. This is targeted incident,” Baltimore City Police Lt. Sarah Connolly told 


Shortly after the incident, the university issued a 
 on their website warning students to use caution and be aware of their surroundings.


“UMB Police report that four people were shot in the 900 block of W. Fayette Street just before 11:00pm Tuesday night. According to police, two light colored vans pulled to the side of the road near Fayette and Poppleton Streets at 10:55pm. One suspect emerged from each van and began firing into a group gathered at the corner. Four victims were shot. One of the victims was killed. Three others have been taken to area hospitals for treatment.


Police advise you to use caution in the area. Remain aware of your surroundings at all times.”


The city has seen a spike in homicides following the death of 
 — a 25-year-old black man who died from spinal injuries while in police custody — in April. In 2015 alone, there were 
 in Baltimore thus far.


The investigation is ongoing and police are still looking for suspects. Those with any additional information  or students wanting to request a walking escort — are asked to call the UMB Police at 410-706-6882 or the homicide detectives at 410-396-2100.
