Future doctors are getting their first hands-on experience with patients through a student-run clinic in Sparks, Texas.


Medical students from the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center of El Paso Paul L. Foster School of Medicine have created a free clinic to help residents in this rural community near Horizon City.


“We hope to establish ourselves as the primary care clinic for those in the community who have no other means of getting health care, whether they have no health insurance, are unable to afford health care elsewhere, or are undocumented,” said Victoria Nuñez, one of the clinic founders.


Nuñez, a fourth-year medical student, along with Chetna Pande and Andy Billnitzer — both who graduated last year and doing their residencies at John Hopkins — and Jessica Philips, another fourth-year student, began researching on how to start a student-led clinic in February 2013.


The Sparks clinic at 106 Peyton Road opened in October 2013. It’s open twice a month, mostly Tuesdays from 6 to 10 p.m. Occasionally, there are sports physical clinics and mammogram screenings.


“We did a site visit in the community and it just seemed to fit,” said Nuñez, who is applying to family medicine. “There was a need since a physician had just left that area and they were left without care.”


The medical students at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Paul L. Foster School of Medicine Medical Student Run Clinic are supervised by faculty members of the medical school.


All medical students are able to volunteer depending on their schedule and each student participates at different levels based on their knowledge level.


“It’s a great learning opportunity for them,” said Dr. Blanca Garcia, an assistant professor of pediatrics and one of the clinical directors. “The students get to go out and practice the skills they are going to need. They evaluate the patients, they interview the patients and they exam the patients, all this under the close supervision of the faculty.”


The medical students duties depend on their classification and expertise.


“The first-year students will do more of the triage, like getting the vital signs,” she said. “The second-year medical students, under the supervision of a third- or fourth-year student, might get to see patients. Our fourth-year medical students, who have already gone through most of their core rotations, can supervise these younger students to make sure they are doing things the proper way.”


Once the students see the patient, the medical students will present to the faculty member in charge.


“We’ll then go in and see the patient together, and the attending physician will repeat the history and the physical exam and talk about what they did right and what they did wrong and maybe demonstrate how they did  the exam,” she said.


For Jeremy Stewart, a third-year student from Arlington, Texas, working in the clinic provided him an opportunity work with patients in real-life situations.


“Not only do you get to practice what you’re learning, but you also get to experience the reason you got into medicine,” he said. “Being out there is a reminder of why you got into medicine in the first place and that’s to help people.”


Stewart was there the first day the clinic opened in 2013.


“When I first went out there, I was kind of surprised that there were areas like that,” Stewart said. “I was never really exposed to anything like that before.”


Stewart said he is grateful to have the opportunity to work with the residents of Sparks.


“When you’re in your first and second year, you’re in the library a lot so you’re not really exposed to patients very much,” he said. “And if you are, you’re shadowing. So when I got to be in the triage part of the clinic, even just interacting with patients and getting to practice my Spanish, I was ecstatic.”


The medical students do everything from check-in, registration, lab tests, physical exams — pretty much anything that needs to be done.


“We do triage, we run labs for them, everything,” Stewart said. “The attending Texas Tech physician is there making sure things are done the right way. They are the ones making the ultimate decision, they are the ones signing off on everything.”


Because of this experience, Stewart said he would consider a future in public health care.


“I’m still going along for the ride to see where things take me,” he said. “I’m at the point where everything I do is interesting to me. Wherever I am, I’ll definitely take some time to volunteer in areas where they are not as fortunate.”


Natalia Sidhu, a second-year medical student who works at the clinic, said she is making the most of her time volunteering.


As part of the leadership team, Sidhu is learning how to actually run a clinic by taking care of inventory, taking care of patient flow and taking care of charts for the patients.


“The reason I’m going into medicine is I enjoy interacting with patients and helping them,” she said.


Sidhu is inspired doing community-based, grassroots medicine.


“Its extremely rewarding and fulfilling, because when we go out there we see the great need they have,” she said. “The biggest thing is that it shows you how grateful the patients are once they are seen by a physican. They are extremely grateful and that makes me feel good.”
