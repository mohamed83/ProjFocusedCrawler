ROSEBURG, Ore. — Residents of this rural town braced Friday for the release of the names of the 10 people killed in a shooting at Umpqua Community College in southern Oregon.
On Thursday, the shooting prompted a visibly frustrated President Obama to renew his calls for more gun regulation.
Authorities say the male shooter — who they have refused to name publicly in an effort to avoid giving him further notoriety — was killed in a shootout with police shortly around 10:30 a.m. Pacific time on Thursday.
They have not released a motive and said the victims' identities would be released by the state medical examiner's office as early as Friday.
"I don't even want to know the names yet. I'm not ready," said Gail Kuntz, as she 
 late Thursday. "Once the names are released, it's going to hurt this community all over again."
Seven others were injured in the shooting at the southern Oregon college when the gunman opened fire in a classroom. It was the fourth shooting on a U.S. college campus since August.
"Let me be very clear: I will not name the shooter," Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said at an evening press conference. "Focus your attention on the victims and their families and helping them recover."
Two of the 10 people initially admitted to Mercy Medical Center after the shooting will remain, one in critical condition and one in stable condition, Jason Gray, chief medical officer, told reporters Friday. They were among four who underwent operations from gunshot wounds. One of the four has been released and another was expected to leave the hospital Friday.

    Douglas County, Oregon Sheriff John Hanlin says he won't name the man who shot and killed nine people on a community college campus on Thursday. The gunman, identified by an anonymous official as Chris Harper Mercer, was also killed. (Oct. 2)

Gray also said that two of the original 10 were treated and released and one person died in the hospital. The remaining three were transferred to another area hospital.
Federal law enforcement sources nevertheless identified the shooter as Chris Mercer, who lived in the area.

    The father of a man who officials have identified as the Oregon community college gunman says he's as shocked as anybody at the deaths of 10 people including his son. Ian Mercer spoke to reporters in Tarzana, California on Thursday night. (Oct. 2)
    
AP
They said he was armed with four firearms, including a rifle. Authorities are investigating whether Mercer specifically targeted victims, instead of firing randomly into classrooms.
On Friday morning, Hanlin 
 that "a number of firearms" were found at the school and at the suspect's home. He said specific details would be provided later. The state Medical Examiner's office worked overnight to identify the victims, he said.

Responding to a report that the suspect asked the religion of a victim, Hanlin said he had also heard that, but it was "way too early to determine" if the shooting was a hate crime.
Dustin Cosby, an associate professor at Umpqua Community College, said that with such a small town "everyone's connected."
As of late Thursday, Cosby didn't know whether any of his students had been killed or injured in the shooting, but he helped organize the vigil so all could pay their respects.
Kuntz, who brought boxes of candles to the vigil, said her best friend is attending nursing school at the college, which has a large nursing program and also a strong cadre of military and National Guard members.
"I heard about it and I called her and I was yelling at the phone while it was still ringing," Kuntz said. "All I could do was cry when she answered."
