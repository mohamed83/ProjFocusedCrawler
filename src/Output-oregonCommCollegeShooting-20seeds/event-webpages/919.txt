If your spring break or summer vacation plans include visiting college campuses, you don’t have to wait until you set foot on campus to start your visit. You can visit college before you leave home with just a smartphone in hand.


Mobile campus guides and smartphone apps are the next best thing to a personal campus tour guide. Not only will an app help you get around campus, it’s also useful before, during and after your college visit.


The easiest, most direct way to find out if the college or university you want to visit has a mobile app is to go to the app store of your choice and search for the college by name. College and university apps will likely cost nothing to download. Explore the screen shots to get an idea about the type of content included in the app.


The type of information published in a college app will vary from app to app and college to college. Some schools have published apps where the main focus is on the currently enrolled students rather than the prospective or visiting students. These apps will contain menu links to resources such as course listings, student services, the library and almost always, a map of campus.


A true campus-visit app may include these topics but will also provide information about campus tours, directions to campus, geo-location services to help you navigate campus and information about admissions requirements, applications and deadlines. Most likely, the app will also boast gorgeous photos to help introduce you to the campus and its surroundings.


If you don’t see this type of information on the main menu or in the table of contents, return to app store and search on the term “campus visit.” This will narrow the search results to only those apps geared toward helping you navigate the campus as well as the college admission process.


Before you visit:


• Explore the app, including the list of majors, history of the school and college profile/enrollment data.

• Read up on admission requirements.

• View any virtual tours or videos included in the app.

• Look for directions, lodging and other travel info needed to plan your visit.

• Register for campus tours or open house programs.


During your campus visit:


• Search the app for a self-guided or walking tour of campus. This is a great way to get to know the campus first-hand.

• Use the geo-location to find the features of campus that interest you: the labs, dorms, athletic center and so on.

• Take your own photos of campus to help you remember the experience once you return home.


After your visit:


• Did you fall in love the moment you set foot on campus? If so, then snag a photo from the wallpaper section of the app or use one you took on campus and make it the wallpaper or background of your phone!

• Send a thank-you email to the admissions representative or tour guide you met.

• Make notes about your visit and tag them so you can find them later.

• Share photos from your visit with friends and family.

• Plan your next college visit!
