As 
 work to better accommodate lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) students on their campuses, two universities – the University of Tennessee-Knoxville (UTK) and Harvard — have taken steps to promote the usage of proper pronouns for their (LGBTQ) communities over last month.


While UTK’s initiative was “offered as a resource to (the) campus community on inclusive practices,” it was a deprecating and seemingly counterproductive shot at equality. Harvard’s, meanwhile, was a sincere and well-thought-out initiative to better suit all students with their respective pronouns.


UTK, a university of 
, released a gender-neutral pronoun chart in August, recommending students use only these non-specific pronouns so as to not offend those who identify with a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth.




Although 
 said it intended for this suggestion to promote inclusion, students, faculty  and some Tennessee lawmakers fought the initiative almost immediately. 


The uproar ultimately forced the university’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion to release a 
on Aug. 28 that read:


“We would like to offer clarification on statements referring to gender-neutral language.


There is no mandate or official policy to use gender-neutral pronouns. We do not dictate speech. Most people prefer to use the pronouns he and she. However, some don’t.


The information provided in this week’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion newsletter was offered as a resource to our campus community on inclusive practices.


We strive to be a diverse and inclusive campus and to ensure that everyone feels welcome, accepted, and respected.”


Less than a week after UTK’s retraction, Harvard University launched its own gender-inclusive initiative on Sept. 2. The university added a gender identity selection tool to its registration process, letting students select their preferred pronouns upon enrollment, 
.


Unlike UTK, whose initiative would have issued one blanket pronoun – “ze” — to all students, Harvard empowered its students by allowing them to personally select their identifying pronouns.


RELATED: 


The university not only offered a non-traditional pronoun alternative to students who identify with a gender other than one assigned to them at birth, but Harvard also gave its students who prefer to use traditional pronouns – such as “he” or “she” — the freedom to do so.


UTK’s initiative – to standardize “ze” as a universal pronoun — would have been unfair to those who prefer to identify themselves with traditional pronouns such as “he” or “she.” It would have taken certains freedoms away from one group in order to grant them to another.


But Harvard’s suggested system allows its students — whether male, female, trans or other — to express their respective gender identities and request representation that reflects them most accurately, which truly embodies the idea of gender personalization for all.
