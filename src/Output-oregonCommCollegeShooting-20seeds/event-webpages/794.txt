While contributing to a 
 effort through your college is a great way to be involved, student organizations can become more socially responsible in ways that help fulfill the missions of the organization.


My Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) chapter worked with a local Girl Scout troop to conduct a public speaking workshop during the 2011 spring semester. Not only did we give back to the community but our seminar was relevant to PRSSA’s missions and involved our interests. Student-run organizations can easily host community service events, remain transparent and genuine in their intentions, while benefiting both organizations mutually through this step-by-step guide explaining how to get started.


1. Take a look at your club’s objectives and missions. What is it that makes your organization appealing to members? Figure out what your organization is providing to its members and once you establish that, you can all discuss which type establishment you can work with that is appropriate to your organization’s mission.


2. Research your local community. For example, if you are a music organization, you can look into sponsoring a concert to raise money for a local after school music program or host a music seminar where your members teach children how to play instruments. There are always local businesses open to help student-run organizations with community service events.


3. Reach out to the organization that is of interest to you and your team. Find someone to speak with that works with volunteers. Plan out your ideas clearly, so you can provide them with a step-by-step scenario of what you think your organization can provide to theirs. You must also be open to their edits and suggestions and be willing to compromise on how the event or act of volunteerism will work.


Things to do/bring for your event:


• Dress appropriately based on the event (If you are playing with children outside, wear casual clothes. If you are doing a speaking engagement, dress professionally).


• Bring a camera to document your event to share with other organizations and your college.


• Make sure that all the supplies you need are all set (i.e. PowerPoint deck, handouts, laptop, food and etc.).


Still can’t think of anything for your organization? Check out some ideas below!


Advertising club

Have your members make advertisements for local businesses (The business gets free advertisements and your members get portfolio pieces).


Fashion club

Design and create clothing to donate to shelters.


Club Sports

Host a tournament for local children groups.


Business club

Work with a local start-up company and present them a business plan of your suggestion.


Local organizations are always looking for student-run organizations to volunteer and participate with them. What better way to give back to the community than to do something relevant to your club’s objectives? Be transparent, think creatively and your student-run organization will be more socially responsible!
