College life is filled with an unending stream of serious issues, lighthearted frustrations, significant events and viral trends. The College Problems Podcast wades into this stream with a regular series of spirited chats attempting to make sense of it all, while also offering story ideas to student journalists and advice for undergrads on staying safe and sane.


The podcast is hosted by a pair of younger educators and digital media geeks who view the collegiate sphere through the lenses of journalism and personal safety.

, we addressed a single timeless problem: campus parking. More specifically, we touched on a few of the many pronounced parking frustrations shared by students, faculty and staff at schools nationwide — including the rising price of parking permits, the seemingly increasing spate of parking tickets and of course the maddening lack of spots.


Expanding upon that discussion, we tackle a pair of problems in our current podcast segment: the complexities surrounding the issue of firearms on campus and the prevalence of students wearing pajamas to class.




As University of Virginia student Vondrae McCoy 
 about the latter in 
The Cavalier Daily
, “‘Can I wear pajamas out of the house to class?’ As a college student, you’ve probably asked yourself this question many times. I’m here to tell you that the answer is, in fact, no. The answer has always been no. The answer will forever be no. Pajamas, defined as anything you wore or could have worn to bed the night before, should never be worn in an academic setting. Waking up in the morning and not changing your clothes is simply unacceptable. This fashion faux pas is one of the most unforgivable, second only to wearing Crocs.”
