People gather at UNC-Chapel Hill’s “Pit” to mourn for Deah Shaddy Barakat, his wife Yusor Mohammed and her sister Razan Mohammed Abu-Salha in Chapel Hill, N.C., Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2015. (AP Photo/The News & Observer, Travis Long)


Thousands gathered for a candlelit vigil at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Wednesday night to commemorate the killings of three Muslim students.


The fatal shootings, which occurred Tuesday around 5 p.m., have been labeled a 
 of two of the victims and sparked speculation on Facebook and Twitter — much of it using the hashtag #muslimlivesmatter — that the killings were religiously motivated.


Speakers at Wednesday’s vigil chose not to focus on this speculation, but instead centered their remarks on the lives and legacies of Shaddy Barakat, 23; his wife, Yusor Mohammad, 21; and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19.

“Our whole community is heartbroken, and there’s no escaping that,” says UNC Student Body President Andrew Powell. “The clear message is to not fight fire with fire and to not to be ignorant in the face of ignorance, but instead to rise above it, and to carry their legacies forward through our own actions.”


School administrators, members of the Chapel Hill community and UNC’s Muslim Student Association collaborated to organize the event — which over 5,700 people said they would attend on its Facebook page.

“This campus really came together,” Powell says. “We’ve tried to do everything we can to honor our three heroes.”

Karthik Sundaram, a UNC sophomore who attended the vigil, describes the turnout as “powerful” — especially considering the speed with which it was organized.


“We don’t know a lot about the motivation of the murders, but regardless, their family and friends wanted us to be happy that they had been able to live, and live such great lives,” Sundaram says.


Barakat was in his second-year in the graduate school of dentistry at the University of North Carolina, and Mohammad, his wife, was planning to enroll there in the fall. Abu-Salha was a sophomore studying architecture at North Carolina State University.


They were long-time volunteers at the United Muslim Relief, and Barakat and his wife helped found UMR’s community chapter in the Triangle area, according to 
.


Speakers — including UNC Chancellor Carol Folt, friends, family and co-workers of the victims — concentrated on their ambition, loyalty and generosity.

“I promise all of you standing in the cold, these people were worth it,” says a close friend of Mohammad. “They would want you to know that life is short — do something with it, have an impact, continue their legacy.”


Sophomore Pooja Panduranga said that although heartbroken, the largest takeaway from the vigil was inspiration.


“I left tonight wanting to be just like Deah, Yusor, and Razan: caring, sweet, intelligent, selfless people who were dedicated to making the world a better place,” said Panduranga. “I was also inspired by the solidarity and immense support displayed today. We showed that everyone’s life truly matters and that the three victims deserved the highest honors.”
