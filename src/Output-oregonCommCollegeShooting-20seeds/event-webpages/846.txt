Resignations, firings and “forced retirements” for college and university presidents are far more common than you might think.


In just the past few months, dozens of schools’ chief executives have stepped aside — voluntarily and against their wishes. Among the schools that recently lost their leaders: Arcadia University, Community College of Philadelphia, Erskine College and Seminary, Florida Atlantic University, Ohio State University, St. John’s University, St. Mary’s College of Maryland, Trinity College, University of Hawaii, University of Puerto Rico and Virginia Tech University.


Below are three of the more high-profile recent resignations, followed by basic career lessons students can learn from them.


1. Ohio State University president Gordon Gee
 announced his retirement last week. It is regarded by many as a de facto resignation amid a controversy sparked by jokes he made about Catholics and the University of Notre Dame.


Gee, a 
 and one of the highest paid university presidents in the U.S., is known in popular culture for his colorful bow ties and “a history of making questionable remarks.”

Retiring Ohio State President Gordon Gee discusses his decision to leave in July at a news conference on Wednesday, June 5, 2013, at the Ohio State student union in Columbus, Ohio.




Most recently, as 
The Lantern
 student newspaper at OSU reported, “Gee made jokes [in a December meeting] about Notre Dame, and said ‘those damn Catholics’ of Notre Dame can’t be trusted and that’s why the university was never invited into the Big Ten. He was also recorded saying Notre Dame’s priests are ‘holy on Sunday, and they’re holy hell on the rest of the week.'”


Lessons
: Humor is increasingly a high-wire act in professional settings. As 
 puts it, “[I]t’s true that one man’s joke is another man’s offense.”


Separately, always be aware that what you say in a closed-door meeting may be repeated in public. And while one gaffe may be forgiven, regular blunders make you an easy target to eventually be shown the door.


2. Florida Atlantic University president Mary Jane Saunders
 announced her own resignation plans in mid-May. Saunders became the bullseye for a slew of press criticism aimed at the school in recent months.


Among the scandals that went viral: an FAU faculty member questioning whether last December’s Sandy Hook school shootings actually happened and another instructor ordering students during class to step on papers with “Jesus” written on them.


Ultimately, Saunders said she was not prepared for the “intense media scrutiny” accompanying her presidential position and longed to return to the relative quiet of her previous work as a botany professor.

In her words, “The extent of being a quote-unquote public figure was something that I really, truly wasn’t prepared for … An expectation that a president can control the behavior of their students and faculty is unrealistic at best.”


Lessons
: When assuming a position of power, expect critical press attention. To that end, realize that being the face of an organization requires a thick skin. At the same time though, when you become the story — and the story is not a happy one — your days are most likely numbered.


3. George Wasson, president of the St. Louis Community College’s Meramac campus
, tendered his resignation late last semester. His action immediately followed a furor over the school’s handling of a sexual assault assailant and incident.


School officials confirm they “didn’t respond fast enough when a 19-year-old female student was assaulted by … a former male student who has been expelled.”


As 
 confirms, “The uproar after the attack has included questions about why the campus police initially released the suspect with little more than a verbal warning not to return to the campus, and why no one sent out an alert about the attack.”


It is unclear how much Wasson was involved with these miscues and others. The assault victim has even publicly stated, “I just hope they’re not pinning this all on him and hoping it will all go away.”


Lessons
: Along with day-to-day oversight, a leader’s job is often measured by their handling of crises and scandals. Your ascension to the spotlight of a leadership position comes with a caveat — you are also more likely to be made a scapegoat. To help ensure that doesn’t happen, be proactive in establishing procedures to handle potential problems — lessening the chances things will go awry when a crisis occurs.


But in the end, recognize your job security is always tenuous, at times due to events totally or largely out of your control.
