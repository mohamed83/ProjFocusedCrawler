The man wanted in the deadly shooting at a community college in North Carolina has been arrested in Florida, police said Tuesday.


Kenneth Stancil III, 20, was spotted sleeping on the beach in Daytona Beach, Fla. and arrested without incident, Goldsboro, N.C., police reported on the department’s Facebook page.


Stancil is accused of shooting a print shop director, Ron Lane, at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro on Monday morning.


WNCN-TV reported that a relative of Lane’s said that Stancil had once worked for Lane and had been fired, but police have not said if that’s why Lane was killed.


Goldsboro police said Stancil had a knife with him when he was arrested Tuesday morning.


Officials will work to have Stancil returned to North Carolina to face charges, Goldsboro police said.
