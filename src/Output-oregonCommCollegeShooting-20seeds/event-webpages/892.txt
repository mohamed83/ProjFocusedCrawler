For nearly two months, Christian lived his life without a family or a permanent home. He spent his days at a facility in North Carolina, waiting.


In February, luck found him. It came in the form of Rachel Shaw, a sophomore at East Carolina University. The exercise physiology student formed an immediate bond with Christian, spending multiple afternoons with him and even hosting him at her apartment for several weeks in February.


Ultimately, Christian, a two-year old pit-mix dog, found a permanent home with a North Carolina family.


The fostering experience, Shaw says, was the most rewarding opportunity provided to her through the 
 (HSEC), an organization she joined in January as a way to serve the needs of animals in her community. Her family currently cares for five foster animals: three dogs — Carson, Avery and Berkeley — and two kittens.


Carson, who Shaw and her family rescued from Snowflake Animal Rescue in Raleigh, N.C., will stay with Shaw in her Greenville N.C. home during the academic year. After fostering Christian, Shaw knows taking care of a dog while balancing a full college course load will be challenging, but says she looks forward to spending time with her dog and continuing to volunteer at HSEC.

“Making time is always the biggest challenge. If most college kids are like me, well then they are busy all the time with school stuff,” Shaw says. “I try to plan my days accordingly so I have time to walk Carson for at least 45 minutes — it’s good for his health. And once he gets his exercise, he usually sleeps for the rest of the day.”


Bethann Wilkie, the executive director of the Humane Society of Eastern Carolina, says HSEC’s weekday foster program provides great benefits for the animals during the spring semester. Wilkie credits Shaw with helping Christian at a crucial time in his life.


“Christian was one of those dogs that was becoming insecure. [Rachel] kind of stepped in when he needed her. He was becoming an institute dog, and that’s never a good thing for shelter animals,” Wilkie says. “He got lots of love and attention [from Rachel] and kind of took a break from the day-to-day activities of what he would do in a shelter.”


Other college students around the country have also connected with their local animal rescue facility to work as both volunteers and interns.


, the health professional society at Virginia Tech University, allows students to earn membership points by volunteering with the Christiansburg Humane Society. Virginia Tech, as a university, has also actively contributed funds to Humane Society of Montgomery County and contributed more than $7,000 to the organization in 2012, according to the university’s 
.

On the other end of the country, Bonnie Buntain, Shane C. Burgess and the University of Arizona are looking to launch a hands-on curriculum in 2016 as part of the university’s veterinary medical education program. Buntain, who previously organized a veterinarian school at the University of Calgary in Canada, will apply her experience working with modern veterinarian schools to help the University of Arizona move through the accreditation process.


Although the program will not begin until 2016, Buntain anticipates that its partnership with the Humane Society of Southern Arizona (HSSA) will allow students to expand their skills and become proficient in a variety of animal medical fields.


“The exciting thing about the Humane Society is that [the students] get to see a whole population of animals, not just individual animals like you see in a veterinary practice,” Buntain says. “They also are introduced to the business of a non-profit organization and the important roles that veterinarians play and veterinarian surgeons play in these clinics..”


Burgess, vice president for veterinary sciences and cooperative extension 
at the University of Arizona, says the school’s partnership with the Humane Society in Tucson, Ariz. benefits both the students and HSSA.


“It will be a win-win for the Humane Society of Southern Arizona,” Burgess says. “HSSA is an independent organization – they aren’t affiliated with the Humane Society of the U.S. – and university investment in facilities or equipment used for teaching will make a positive impact on the number of shelter animals they’re able to care for.”


While HSSA is independent from the national organization, the Humane Society of the United States does offers internships for students in a variety of fields including public policy, media relations and animal care. Renee Urban, a North Carolina State University senior studying communications and animal science, currently works as a media relations intern for the Humane Society. She says she aspires to find a career with a nonprofit animal organization.


“I wanted to be a voice for those who couldn’t speak for themselves. I became proactive and started to volunteer at a local animal shelter and also started keeping up to date on all activities the HSUS was involved in,” Urban says. “I decided to become more involved by applying for an internship at the HSUS so I could help it promote their mission of celebrating animals and confronting cruelty.”
