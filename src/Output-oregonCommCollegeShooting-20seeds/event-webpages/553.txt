It is now officially final exam time at colleges across the United States. Students are finishing up their final projects, spending hours studying inside their campus libraries and dealing with rising stress levels.


Many college students today face a greater stress-induced environment than their predecessors. 
 of the 2014 freshmen class, over 150,000 students ranked their emotional health at approximately 50%, which is the lowest level recorded in the study.

“Some of my clients who are college students don’t always feel comfortable with some of the classes and professors at their school,” says Dr. Sheri Siegel, a psychologist who specializes in child and young adult behavior, “These issues become even more prevalent during finals. Their grades are on the line.”


Despite evidence of deteriorating mental health in college students, some universities have found innovative methods of reducing anxiety at the most stressful time of the year. Others possess long-standing school traditions, which have grown in popularity over time.


Here are six schools that have special techniques to help their students cope with stress during finals:


1. New York University


At NYU, students receive delicious and motivational gifts from the campus health center. “They hand out goodie bags with stress balls and chocolate in them during our midterms and final exams. They get really into it,” says NYU freshman Alison Swoish.


2. Brown University


Brown University students have actually taken it upon themselves to help their fellow undergraduates get through rough study sessions. “Towards the end of our reading period, a secret group of people will go all over campus and hand out doughnuts in the nude,” says Brown sophomore Brian Cohn. The decade-old Naked Doughnut Run is a sacred tradition and one the university continues to support every semester.

3. Tulane University


Down in New Orleans, Tulane University keeps their dining facilities open late in the evening for a celebration students like to call Cram Jam. “It’s a theme night where the freshmen dining hall opens up to all Tulane students for extra hours,” says Tulane senior Laura Aronoff, “There’s a ton of food, music, and fun!”


4. University of Georgia


Instead of singular events at the end of each semester, UGA students get to experience school-sponsored relaxation in their libraries throughout the year. Their de-stress tables have many options to ensure the average stressed-out college student can relieve some anxiety. “They include coloring books, puzzles and sometimes free coffee for the students,” says UGA senior Emily Salerno.

5. Arizona State University


ASU takes an alternative route by getting the parents of the students involved during finals preparation. “The honors college has something called Smoothie Saturday,” says ASU sophomore Katherine Segell, “Moms and dads come in to make homemade smoothies for their kids.”


6. University of Southern California










Every night before final exams, the USC Trojan Marching Band plays USC fight songs outside the only campus library open for 24 hours. “The Primal Scream is a really fun way to let off steam, to represent our school, and motivate the students studying away in the library,” says student and band member Katherine Desmond, “It’s nice to have a study break every once in a while!”
