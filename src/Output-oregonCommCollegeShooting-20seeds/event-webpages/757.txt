When Doug Messer decided to leave Syracuse University to pursue his business, 
, he knew he wouldn’t be leaving the college environment far behind.


University Beyond is a website that allows college students to connect with businesses that are offering jobs on campus. The job listings on the site range from brand ambassadors to working on a social media team.


Messer credits his entrepreneurial spirit to his family.




“I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so I’ve been exposed to it my whole life.” Said Messer. “My grandfather started an accounting firm, and my dad started a construction and development company, so it was a natural progression for me. I was that kid selling candy on the bus at 12 years old for a few cent profit.”

Messer and co-founder Brendan Weinstein came up with the idea for University Beyond when they were trying to expand on another business idea. 


“We were frustrated with the lack of options to recruit additional students for our program and had to use multiple platforms to execute it.” Said Messer “That’s when the idea for University Beyond came to mind.”


The pair have already worked with Mountain Dew, Dunkin Donuts and Amazon, among other employers who have listed on the site.


Messer credits some of University Beyond’s success to the opportunities that given to young entrepreneurs at Syracuse.


“I recommend all young founders get involved with their universities entrepreneurship program if it’s available.” Said Messer “I was provided office space, assistance with various aspects of developing my business and had the credibility to tell my teachers if I was going to be late because of a client or investor call.






Some people want it to happen. Some people wish it would happen. Others make it happen.


— Doug Messer (@Dougyymesser) 




Now that University Beyond is off the ground, Messer is aiming to build upon that success next year.


“Our goals for the next year are to raise our next round of funding and ramp up our student acquisition. We’ve been lucky to work with a ton of really cool brands and were looking forward to having our students gain experience with the dozens of brands hiring for Fall 2015.”
