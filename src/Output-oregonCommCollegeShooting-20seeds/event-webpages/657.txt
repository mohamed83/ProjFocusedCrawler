As a freshmen just starting your first year at college, it’s normal that your nerves and worries are kicking into high gear. You’re about to enter uncharted territory, an entirely different world than high school (socially and academically). That said, the first week of college is a complete blast. This is the time to put yourself out there, meet a huge variety of people, and start school on a carefree, high note.


…but before you get too giddy, notice that I said carefree… not careless. Yes, a carefree student may be chill and cool, but she’s definitely classy.


So, we’ve prepped you on 
 and navigating your 
, but now it’s time to hit you with an all-too-necessary list of things NOT to do that first week on campus.


1. Hook up with multiple guys in the first week


Welcome to the realm of college boys. You’re far away from (hopefully) immature high school boys with teenage acne and cracking voices. To put it as simply and politely as possible, just because you now believe what your mom said about there being many fish in the sea doesn’t mean you have to catch as many as you can. If you’re patient the first week and actually make a habit of getting to know the guys you meet before getting ‘intimate’ with them, then your chances of catching a keeper improve significantly.


2. Pick teams


Avoid hanging out at the same place every night. Don’t spend all your time in the same guys’ suite/frat house/hockey house (you get the picture: don’t pick one and only one nightly hangout spot). We get it—you don’t know many people yet and having a familiar place to go is comfortable. But if you keep an open mind and don’t limit yourself to one place and/or one group of people, you’ll be more comfortable at your new school in the long run. This is the time to branch out and, trust us, it’s harder to branch out and randomly introduce yourself to people the further into the school year you get.

3. Pick your besties


Why do we mention this next, you ask? You can’t be closed-minded when it comes to meeting new people. You cannot, should not, choose your best friends and play ‘favorites’ the first week at school. As HC Contributing Writer Tarina from Harvard says, “The first week is an opportunity to hang out with lots of different people and see who you really click with.” Don’t let one person or one group of people hold you back from meeting more. “Plus, a girl’s circle of friends changes up a lot during the first year of college, so it’s important to mingle a lot from the beginning to get to know a variety of people,” Tarina says.


4. Run your mouth


Don’t talk about people you just met (or worse, people you have yet to meet) behind their back. This is probably one of the easiest ways to repel friends, not make them. Enough said.

5. Go doll-ed up the first day


Don’t get overly dolled up for your first day of class. This isn’t the first day of freshman year in high school where you’re trying to impress your classmates by having the cutest outfit or being the best dressed. Dress for yourself: wear what makes you comfortable, and wear it with confidence. That said, while you want to make a good impression on your peers and potential future friends, you can’t forget about the other important group of people you’re meeting for the first time: your professors. Even though I say you should dress comfortably, do not wear sweatpants or pajama pants on your first day of class (or any day of class, ideally). This is a dead giveaway to teachers that you just don’t give a sh**.

6. Be a homebody


You didn’t move away from home just to go running right back (metaphorically speaking) to your mom and dad. Try to avoid the urge to call home every time a problem arises. For example, before you pick up the phone to ask for the step-by-step directions about how to do your own laundry (yes, you are a grown-up now—well sort of), try asking someone in your suite or hall if they want to brave laundry day together. Chances are, you’re probably not the only one who is unsure about whether to wash in hot or cold water… So, how about it? Instead of being a homebody, try meeting somebody.
