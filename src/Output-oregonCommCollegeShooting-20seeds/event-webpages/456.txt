While student newspapers may attract more journalism students, it’s a worthwhile experience for students of all majors. (Thinkstock)


Freshmen are often bombarded with the opportunities that college holds for them — whether these are discovered through an a cappella team serenading them in the quad or an environmental awareness club ironically passing out flyers on every corner.


Some of these opportunities leave you with a free t-shirt and something small to tack onto your resume. Others help you develop lifelong skills that will shape your postgrad life. Writing for your campus newspaper definitely falls into the latter category.


While student newspapers may attract more journalism students, it’s a worthwhile experience for students of all majors.


1. It gives you a well-rounded set of writing and research skills, regardless of your chosen major.


The campus newspaper may seem daunting to those without prior journalism experience, but it’s actually the perfect way to develop a balanced set of writing skills. While most colleges require students of all majors to take writing classes, these courses will never be able to provide the same opportunity to discover as many different styles of writing. From writing Op-Eds to taking pictures for the photo desk, the kinds of storytelling skills you will gain are exceptionally diverse.


Olivia Deng, a rising senior at Boston University, says her time with 
The
 
Daily Free Press 
has rounded out her economics major and enriched her undergraduate career.


“Though I may not study journalism, the research, time management and writing skills that I gained from my experience have helped me greatly,” she says. “There is something very rewarding about wholeheartedly pursuing a subject outside of your area of study. Non-journalism majors, do not be deterred.”


2. It teaches you how to manage your time wisely.


The sudden surge of freedom accompanying the beginning of college can be exciting, but after syllabus week is over, it can be tough to balance homework, extracurricular activities and a social life. The key to success? Efficient time management.


Taking on the additional task of writing stories for the campus newspaper forces you to prioritize what’s important and to work more resourcefully. After a while, that task becomes a true passion.


“I’d tell anyone who wants to join a paper that it’s a definite time management adjustment because it’s important to keep up with schoolwork too,” says Monika Nayak, a rising sophomore at Boston University. “But try to take every opportunity for a story you can handle … Consistency and hard work really pay off.”


3. It’s your best chance to get a close look at how real-world newsrooms operate.


College serves as a transition between the sheltered high school experience and the hectic real world. It gives you the opportunity to mature not only personally, but professionally. Knowing how a newspaper functions is vital for future journalists, but also for anyone looking for a way to take the metaphorical training wheels off of their career.


Brianne Johnson, a recent alumna of the University of Michigan, wrote for the
 Michigan Daily
 for five years. And while she did gain professional experience outside of her campus newspaper, the 
Daily
 provided her with lifelong lessons and talents.


“The kind of forced independence and professional ‘growing up’ is one of my biggest takeaways from college,” she says. “I learned more at the 
Daily
 than I ever did — or probably could — from an internship.”

Felicia Gans, a rising junior at Boston University, echoes Johnson’s sentiments.


Gans is currently a member of the 
Boston Globe’s
 
 — a temporary, entry-level news-writing program for college students — and credits 
The
 
Daily Free Press
 with helping her transition from college to the professional journalism world.


“College newspapers are the harshest version of reality a young, 18-year-old freshman can ever jump into,” she says. “They push you, challenge you and shape you until you’re the journalist you never realized you could be.”


4. It gives you the chance to discover your interests.


One of the best parts about writing for your campus newspaper is its flexibility. Since they are typically student-run, your editors are there to help you explore your interests, even if that means encouraging you to write for multiple sections at a time.


Reflecting on her college career, Johnson credits the 
Daily
 with giving her the chance to define her interests and passions as a writer.


“
The Daily
 created space to grow and gave me both the freedom to build my own tone and style and the structure to develop my skills as an effective reporter.”


Clinton Nguyen, a recent alumnus of Boston University and a current writer for 
, a division of Vice Media, agrees with Johnson.


As the multimedia editor at 
The Daily Free Press
, he had the ability to try out innovative projects — the kind that tend to attract many newcomers to the newspaper.


“I’m grateful I was given a weird position at the 
FreeP
 [
Daily Free Press
] too,” he says. “Multimedia editors constantly redefine their roles depending on where their strengths are. In my case, it gave me an avenue to do some coding and crack a few jokes on social media and take a few risks within the website.”


5. The newsroom becomes your home away from home and your fellow student journalists become your family.


Moving out can be a difficult transition for many freshmen, especially those who have grown accustomed to their steady community of friends and family at home. Even if you have friends attending the same college, joining the newspaper launches you into a welcoming environment full of students with similar interests. The long hours spent writing and editing in the office help everyone bond quickly and you have the opportunity to gain friends that you admire both personally and professionally.


“It [the newspaper] gave me really tight rapport with some very hardworking colleagues,” Nguyen says. “It makes you feel accountable to them and you lose that pretty quickly in the real world when you run into larger and more disconnected teams.”


Gans adds: “It was my home at a point in college when so many people struggle to find one. It was my comfort after a long day of class when I was stressed or upset. It was my inspiration when I was having writer’s block, freaking out about an internship application or worrying about my future as a journalist.”


6. The experience you gain can be a great springboard.


While many of us wish that we could write for our campus newspaper forever, it is important to recognize that our time in college is limited. But the skills you gain 
will 
stay with you forever and will likely help you launch your career.


Anna Novikova, a recent alumna of Boston University, recalls her postgraduate job search and says that her time at the campus newspaper continues to help her in a unique way.


“The communication, organizational and writing and editing skills that I learned while juggling the 
FreeP
 with the rest of my schoolwork partially helped me get a job right out of college,” she says. “It’s not a journalism job per se, but I’m a communications specialist with an environmental trust group. I use a lot of the skills that I learned at my student newspaper.”


Nguyen took this one step further, suggesting that — while the campus newspaper is a valuable resource for the first few years of school — it is critical to get outside experience as well. But of course, those first few years are what help you land internships and jobs in the first place.

“I think it’s important to leave at some point,” he says. “Employers are looking more frequently for rule-breakers and people who can do reporting and incorporate a distinct and authoritative voice while doing so. The newspaper will put you in a position where reporting is unavoidable and that’s great. But I think it’s super important that you have a ‘shout space’ where you can do your best work without it being … edited out.”
