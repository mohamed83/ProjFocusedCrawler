A new class at Texas State University is teaching students all the keys of social media.




Blogging and tweeting are some of the assignments required in Fundamentals of Digital and Online Media, a class recently added to the core curriculum of the mass communication degree at Texas State University.


The first day of Jon Zmikly’s Fundamentals of Digital and Online Media class had one assignment: join Twitter. The purpose of the assignment was to generate class discussion and interaction.


“There are about 370 students in my class. Twitter encourages interaction among them. It lets them connect to others with similar interests,” says Zmikly, a senior lecturer at Texas State University.


The Fundamentals of Digital and Online Media course was recently added to the new Bachelor of Science degree program for mass communication majors at Texas State. According to the Texas State School of Journalism and Mass Communication website, the course is part of a more technology-based core curriculum that aims to enhance digital media skills among the students.


“The department noticed many mass communication students graduating without basic digital media skills and knowledge,” Zmikly says. “An objective of the class is the importance of creating an effective online personal brand for a student with social media. Ways to show off a professional representation of a person.”


Using Twitter and posting blogs are two assignments for students in the class. During class, students can tweet questions to Zmikly.


The class is not just about social media, Zmikly says. In addition to using Twitter, the course teaches basic HTML coding, concepts behind engaging users online and the changing nature of digital media.

“With social media it’s so easy to be inward. The course shows that social media really isn’t about you, it’s about connecting with others,” Zmikly says.


As part of the course requirements, every student is required to set up and maintain a blog for the semester via WordPress. Throughout the semester, students experiment with different media platforms like YouTube, Storify and creating a mock mobile app.


Allie Horton, a junior at Texas State University, says she benefited from the social media platforms introduced to her when she took the class last spring.


“During an interview for an internship, they asked if I had any experience with WordPress. I was able to say yes and ended up getting the internship,” says Horton, who works as a marketing intern at The Long Center for the Performing Arts in Austin, Texas.


Horton says it was great getting to see students connect with each other through Twitter. The experience inspired her to set up a Twitter account for Long Center Interns.


“I use social media for my internship to promote events,” she says. “It was great that the class showed me how to go beyond using it passively and start using it in effective ways.”


 Colin Ashby is a senior mass communications major/writing minor at Texas State University. He serves as the financial officer for the Public Relations Student chapter and coordinating relations officer for the Social Media Club at Texas State.
