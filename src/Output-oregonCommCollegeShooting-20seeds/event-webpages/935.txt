I was driving home from my college town of Austin, Texas to my hometown of Dallas on Sunday afternoon when I first got word of the 
 at Waco, Texas’s Twin Peaks restaurant. Reportedly, nine people died, around 170 suspects were arrested and 18 were injured.


Evidently, 
 that the gathering was going to take place and police later recovered around 
 from the crime scene. Recently the media revealed mugshots of the suspects in question and many of the bikers 


In light of the gunfire and deaths that occurred in Waco, those on social media have begun to notice discrepancies between the way the media depicts the bikers and the way they 
. Furthermore, as a picture of the arrested bikers — who evidently were sitting without handcuffs on — took over Twitter, some wondered if the predominately white biker gang would’ve received different treatment if black.






Damn 9 dead…No tanks? Tear gas? Media calling them thugs? Nothing?

It is also noteworthy that I saw no images of slain bodies today though 9 were killed. I just saw gang members chilling.

Why is it when I Google the fatal biker shootout, I find credible news outlets referring to what happened as a “
” or “
”? However, when I look up the Baltimore protests I see the words “
” and “
?”


To me, the racism is present when a 
, the same teen whose 
, is seen as a violent protestor, while a massive gang shootout is referred to as a 


It seems that the negative terminology is solely reserved for people of color (i.e. the Baltimore protestors) and not the predominately white bikers that engaged in acts of extreme violence. Not only was the mild word choice on various news articles an issue for me (something that inherently revealed cultural stereotypes that the media often pushes,) the lax behavior of the officers at the crime scene was also pretty difficult to watch.


When the bikers in question were able to sit quietly, uncuffed before being taken to jail after the shooting ended, and when it became known that these prominent gang members planned the meet-up, it becomes evident that there is a double standard in how each racial group is depicted.


Why was the National Guard not called? Why were the officers at the scene not dressed for a shootout? Why is there an absence of the term “gang violence” when looking up the events that occurred? Why is there no talk of how “white-on-white crime” is a problem? Why has no city-wide curfew been issued since there are 
?


All of these things happened following the Baltimore protests; however, none with the Waco shootout. Personally, I found the double standard of unfair treatment by police officers reprehensible. If these men in Waco were black, I can only imagine the uproar.


White privilege is the ability for some of the suspects to not be placed in any type of restraint while having 
 after going on a shootout. White privilege is when the 
 for what happened, but officers didn’t take the blame for the murder of Freddie Gray that caused the Baltimore protests.


By now, if you’re unable to see the bias with how the media depicts black people compared to white people, you may not be paying attention. It’s unfair that a predominately white biker gang can kill nine people and leave multiple injured 
 and have it be called a “brawl.” When white people get violent, it’s seen as a “once in every blue moon” incident, but when black people get angry over years of police brutality, we’re painted as thugs, and even some prominent figures in the black community say we need to 
 before law enforcement can.


There’s an inherent fear response to black people being angry vs. white people involved in a massive shootout. Somehow the cops were able to arrest almost 200 violent bikers without pepper spray, mace or murder. It’s a shame that the protestors in Baltimore couldn’t get the same treatment.


What I think is important to understand is that social media commentators don’t seem to be upset with how various media outlets depict the biker gang. Instead, what seems to be issue is that the Waco shooting revealed the inherent hypocrisy when it comes to policing and covering white crime.
