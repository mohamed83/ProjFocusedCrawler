Cristina Velasquez


Senior year of high school is usually met with a barrage of uncertainty about the future. For Cristina Velasquez, an undocumented student from Venezuela, that pool of uncertainty was significantly deeper.


Velasquez, 20, immigrated to the Midwest with her single mother when she was six years old. There, she learned English and acquired an American education. In no time, she says felt as though she was an American.


When she moved to south Florida years later and enrolled at a predominantly Hispanic high school, she stood out among her friends for being overwhelmingly Americanized – so much so that it landed her the nickname “Wisconsin.”


Twelve Fourth of Julys later, Velasquez says she felt American in every way — except in the one way that mattered most if she hoped to attend college: legally.

Her circumstances are not unique.


According to 
, a nonprofit organization that awards undocumented students college scholarships, there are approximately 
 in the U.S. What’s more, an 
 of them drop out of high school. Those who don’t drop out tend to develop early-onset senioritis. Since the road to college for undocumented students often leads to a dead end —  obtaining a high school diploma often marks the final stop —  many opt out of taking the SAT and fulfilling other college admission requirements.




But Velasquez wasn’t fazed. If attending college as an undocumented student seemed far-fetched despite having good grades, then it would be next to impossible with bad ones.


“One day during high school we came home from a concert and we had an AP history exam the next day,” says Ashli Molina, a Boston University student and Velasquez’s close friend. “[Velasquez] was the only one of our friend group who stayed up all night studying, even though she wasn’t sure if she’d be able to go to college.”


“The only thing I could control was the grades I was getting,” Velasquez says. “I knew no harm could come from taking difficult classes and doing well.”




“It was so frustrating that I couldn’t even attend a community college when I had worked so hard.”




But things were about to get more difficult. By the time the fall after high school graduation rolled around, Velasquez’s friends were all packing up for college. She, however, was meeting with a counselor from a local community college.


Because of her status as an immigrant, Velasquez learned she’d have to pay out-of-state tuition.
 
She also learned —  despite having graduated in the top 6% of her high school class — she could not use any of the scholarship money she had earned throughout high school.

“I went home and just cried,” Velasquez says.  “It was so frustrating that I couldn’t even attend a community college when I had worked so hard.”


This harsh reality was interrupted when the Obama administration passed the 
 (DACA) act in 2012, which was enacted shortly after Velasquez graduated from high school. It allowed certain undocumented immigrants — those entered the country before turning 16 and and before June 2007 —  to receive a renewable, two-year work permit and be exempt from deportation.


And it couldn’t have arrived at a more perfect time for Velasquez. After racing to file her paperwork, Velasquez had her long-coveted driver’s license and work permit in hand within months.




“I started working as a secretary at a dentist’s office full-time, and saving so I could afford out-of-state tuition,” Velasquez says. “Knowing that I’d eventually get to go to school made taking a year off feel okay.”


She made it a point to not become idle during her gap year, religiously watching lectures online given by professors at top universities.


RELATED: 


“I found out that there were these free online lectures with worksheets and homework assignments available for download,” she says. “I really didn’t want to go a whole year without school, so I treated these classes as if I’d receive a grade in the end.”


In August of 2013, Velasquez finally enrolled in the honors program at Miami Dade Honors College. Remaining loyal to her personal philosophy, she maintained an impeccable GPA and took on a multitude of extracurricular activities. After two years at the community college, it was time for her to transfer.


“I did a lot of research and applied to 14 schools,” Velasquez says. “I narrowed it down to just the schools that were known to grant financial aid regardless of immigration status.”


Georgetown University — Velasquez’s long-time dream school — proved to be the perfect fit for her needs. When her acceptance and financial aid package were disclosed in May, she says “every single hardship I faced became worth it”

Now, days away from the start of her first semester at Georgetown, Velasquez acknowledges that even within the many layers of her struggle, she was fortunate.


“Many undocumented kids live in cities where people don’t know what being undocumented even means,” she says. “Living in Miami provided me with a lot of resources I fear most people in my situation don’t have.”


Velasquez recognizes that the issue is divisive and that her battle is ongoing. For now, she hopes to offer guidance to other undocumented students, and patiently counts down until orientation.
