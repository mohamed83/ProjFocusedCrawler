In 2012, 
 participated in stand-up paddle boarding (SUP), an activity that has since developed into one of the fastest growing water sports in the world.


In order to meet student demand, colleges and universities across the country have capitalized on the growing interest of the stand-up paddle boarding.


Several colleges, including 
 and the 
, now offer for-credit stand-up paddle boarding. Tom Carroll, a senior instructor at the College of Charleston, has taught the stand-up paddle boarding summer course for four years and hopes the college will consider adding a fall session in 2016.


“We just have to figure out the proper way to do it, and we have to do it safety,” Carroll says. “I think that’s one reason why the classes do well. We don’t just throw them out there, we take our time and do our research.”

Stand-up paddle boarding classes at the College of Charleston count as two credits, and Carroll says students learn about tides and water safety in addition to paddling.


The course remains popular with the students because it allows them to socialize while also exercising and learning new skills, he says. Several of his former students have continued their paddle boarding education beyond the course and worked to gain certification as paddle boarding instructors.


Students at Rollins College have also expressed enthusiasm for the sport, according to adjunct professor Ned Johnson. He says the college’s two SUP classes fill up every semester.


“SUP is the fastest growing water sport in the world,” Johnson says. “Lots of folks enjoy just casual paddling, cruising the rivers lakes and springs, bays. But there is also, fitness, yoga, racing, surf, whitewater, that are all extremely popular and fun on a board. That diversity and the ease of entry into the sport is what I think will keep paddle boarding growing for a long time.”


In an effort to bring the community together through the shared passion for water sports and nature, the 
 and the 
 hosted the bi-annual “Paddle the Potomac” event July 23 in Washington, D.C. More than 100 individuals signed up to paddle on the water, with many flocking to the Key Bridge Boathouse to learn about the environment and experience the beauty of nature.

Mark Wenzler, the senior vice president of conservation programs at the National Parks Conservation Association, says the event let young people take the boats and boards out on the water while also learning the skills and tools necessary to protect their environment.


“Getting more kids involved, bringing parks to more people, helping them understand how they can connect, is really important,” Wenzler says. “Kids love this stuff. Who doesn’t want to be in a boat paddling on a river or looking at a bison or climbing a mountain or skiing down a really cool hill?”

Shannon MacDowell , a 
, has taken her love of paddle boarding and the outdoors to an academic level. In 2013, she launched SUPLOGIX LLC, a company dedicated to discovering the biomechanics behind the sport of paddle boarding.


A 2009 Rutgers graduate, MacDowell partnered with Rutgers University’s BTS bioengineering program and the Manhattan Kayak Company to launch a research project, which evaluated the physical and physiological benefits of paddle boarding. She also completed a second study the assessed the forward stroke of Travis Grant, one of the world’s most elite paddlers.


MacDowell says SUP offers benefits to people of all ages and schools should work to engage their students with the sport, if possible.


“Colleges and universities with access to lakes, oceans, rivers, or even just pools have a super exciting opportunity to explore incorporating SUP into all kinds of recreational programs,” MacDowell says. “SUP paddling, SUP for sports rehabilitation and cross-training, SUP racing, SUP fitness, SUP Pilates, SUP surfing, SUP Yoga and meditation…the possibilities are vast, and all of them are really fun!”


Building off her research, MacDowell entered a floatation device design called the “Infancy Vest” into the BoatUSA 2015 Innovations in Life Jacket Design Competition. Her submission advanced to the “voting round,” and winners of the competition will be announced in September.


Until then, MacDowell is working to develop her vest into a marketable, safe product for paddle boarders across the country. She says her work as a paddle-boarding instructor and personal trainer allow her to connect and support individuals who may never have experienced the sport before.


“I love sharing with my clients the application of gym work to outdoor activities, whether it’s paddling, hiking, cycling, swimming, etc. SUP is great because it requires little equipment, its full-bodied exercise, and it’s super fun.”
