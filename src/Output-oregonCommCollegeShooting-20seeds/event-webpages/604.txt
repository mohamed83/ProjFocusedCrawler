College students combat religious intolerance with interfaith groups

Johnny Martin first heard that Islam is the fastest growing religion when he was in middle school. It was a frightening thought at the time, mainly because he was raised in a Christian family and was told that other religions were bad, he said.


As a converted Muslim pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Religious Studies, and interfaith leader, Martin’s perspective has changed quite a bit since then.


College students around the country promote interfaith to combat religious intolerance that may emerge as religious populations grow, through movements such as the Better Together campaign.


According to projections by the Pew Research Center, the Muslim population will not only equal but also surpass the population of Christians by 2070. Islam will increase faster than the population of the world from 2010 to 2050 with a 35 percent growth, researchers said.


Surveys conducted in the United States focusing on switching also show that Christians are expected to experience the biggest loss in numbers from those who grew up as Christian becoming either unaffiliated or leaving the religion.


Martin, who converted to Muslim after a series of changes in religious identities, including Christian, pluralist and even atheist, did so during his college career.

“In college, students are forced into an environment that is ripe in diversity. A lot of students who come from homogenous communities will go to a large university, where within close proximity there are thousands of Christians and thousands of Muslims and Buddhists and Hindus and atheists, so most students know at least one person from different traditions,” Martin said.


Martin is a founder of Sun Devils Are Better Together, a student organization at Arizona State University that is part of the Better Together campaign. 


The group has a saying: “We shouldn’t focus only on the elephant in the room—the fact that we have vastly different religious beliefs, or none at all—when there are so many other animals in the zoo,” said Spencer Hawkins, a member of Sun Devils Are Better Together. “To me, this means that even though we may believe different things about gods or an afterlife, this shouldn’t prevent us from finding common ground and discussing our shared values in order to move forward together,” he said.

Better Together is a movement that helps students build interfaith cooperation on college campuses, according to the Interfaith Youth Core website. There are over 400 schools that have their own Better Together campaigns, Martin said. Interfaith, as defined by Interfaith Youth Core, builds religious pluralism, including respect for diverse religious and non-religious identities, inspiring mutual relationships between people of different backgrounds, and common action for the common good.


According to research, by 2050, several countries are projected to have a different religious majority than they did in 2010.


Martin believes that interfaith plays a major role in the population’s perception of religion in the future. The research will be regarded with a variety of opinions and reactions in an interfaith audience, Martin said, but will ultimately be observed with tolerance. 


“I would imagine interfaith groups will say, ‘Okay, that’s what we’re dealing with; this is likely happening in the future,’ and will be aware that they will need to focus on combating bigotry and making sure there’s a safe space,” Martin said.


“If the dynamic of the global population’s religious diversity is really going to change so dramatically, it requires people to engage across lines of difference to combat ignorance and intolerance,” he said.
