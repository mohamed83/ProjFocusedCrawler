(By Comstock)


Using a blender is a great way to get a fix of your vital nutrients early in the day or at night.


Grad students are often viewed as intellectually well-off, but a wreck in other categories: broke, starving, unshaven, frantic and sleepless. Vegans, meanwhile, have the reputation of being highly disciplined, organized, Zen-like and even picky.


Grad students are known for eating whatever is free and available, while vegans must plan every bite that goes in their mouths. Do the terms “grad student” and “vegan” sound contradictory to you?


These terms aren’t mutually exclusive to Scott Miller, a PhD student in psychology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and a vegan of three years. He thrives on a vegan diet and you can, too.


Here are five bits of advice from Miller on how to be vegan on a grad school budget and schedule.

• 
The vegan diet can actually be more affordable


You’ve probably heard that veganism is expensive. Well, it’s not actually that expensive, Miller said.


“Generally, I’ve found that it’s cheaper to eat vegan than eat meat,” he said. “Meat is incredibly expensive. Really, just super poor-man’s food like ravioli, that come packed with meat remnants that I wouldn’t touch, are both cheap and not vegan. But if I go out to dinner, I always pay half of what people with me pay because I’m not buying meat.”


The things that are more expensive are meat alternatives — such as “tofurkey” or vegan cheese — and the things advertised as vegan in the healthy aisle of a conventional grocery store, Miller explained. Otherwise, the vegan diet can definitely be affordable for even a poor grad student such as himself.


Google “poor vegan” and you’ll find a ton of 
 resources and recipes.


• 
Blender and vegetables? You’re good to go


A blender is an especially useful tool for a vegan (and everyone, really). Miller recommends the 
, which continually gets ranked the best blender by several different sources. Miller lucked out and found one for $50 used 
. But it should be noted that it costs nearly $500 new.


Other alternatives to the Vitamix that are much cheaper and also ranked high are the 
 ($199.99) and the 
 ($59.99).


“It’s [using a blender] a great way to get a fix of your vital nutrients early in the day or at night,” Miller said.


He recommends a smoothie made with almond milk, bananas, ice and kale. Perhaps throw in a tablespoon of chia seeds for extra nutrition.


• 
Get your nutrients in your diet


Outside of a protein supplement that he puts in his smoothies when working out, Miller doesn’t take any vitamins or supplements. Eat a well-balanced diet and you might not have to either, he said. This is good news for a grad student since multivitamins and other supplements can be pricey.


Another thing vegans are often charged with is: Where are you going to get your protein?


“I don’t know of a food that doesn’t have some amount of protein, even if a small amount,” Miller said. “Protein is so vastly abundant, it’s not something I worry about. It’s in everything.”


Depending on your age, size and gender, you’ll need a different amount of protein per day. The Vegetarian Resource Group has a 
 on its website for vegan protein options.


• 
Don’t fret: There’s almost always something vegan on the menu


Surprising as it may sound, the grad school life is sometimes social. And when it is, Miller has no problem finding food.


“There are very few restaurants where I can’t order something on the menu,” he said. “Most places at least have the option of a salad.”


Some vegans eat before going to social events to be on the safe side, or have a snack with them at all times. Just don’t be arrogant about your diet and most people will respect you and even sometimes cater to your veganism.

 Try these simple recipes:


Here are two of Miller’s favorite quick, cheap vegan meals:


Mashed potatoes:
 Wash potatoes and cut in smaller pieces. Put in boiling water and once soft, drain them. Perhaps throw in a tablespoon of vegan butter and whatever herbs you have handy. Almond milk or soy milk can make it creamier. Miller uses a fork to whip the mixture.


Oatmeal:
 Buy oatmeal in bulk, boil some water, pour it in and kabam! You’ve got oatmeal. Probably add some brown sugar or cinnamon in it. “Fantastic place to throw in walnuts for omega 3 for the day,” Miller said. “Requires very few dishes.”


Also, you can’t go wrong with a salad.


You see? Being vegan doesn’t have to be time consuming or expensive. So much so that even a poor, stressed, hopelessly busy grad school student can pull it off.
