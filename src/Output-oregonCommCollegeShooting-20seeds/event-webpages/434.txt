Applying to college can make anyone’s head spin. And if you’re the first person in your family to ever try it, the application process can be completely overwhelming.


If you’re a 
, know that you’re not alone. “About 15 million students are enrolled in a postsecondary institution. Thirty percent of those students”—some 4.5 million—“are low-income, first-generation students,” says Chelsea Jones, associate director of student programs at I’m First, an online resource center for first-generation college students.


So how do you figure it all out and make smart choices? Here are four things you can do before applying to college this fall.




1. Rally someone to be in your corner.


The best advice is to seek help from others who will support you on the road to college. This could mean reaching out to a teacher, a counselor or friends currently enrolled in college. “Find someone that will rally for you,” says Jones. Their guidance and support will help you get through the ups and downs you might face when applying to and choosing a school.


Students can also get help from organizations like 
. Founded by the Center for Student Opportunity, the online community aims to connect first-generation students with others who can offer support through student testimonials and college planning tools. “We encourage students to be proud of who they are and where they come from,” Jones says. The site can also connect students with colleges that offer services specifically for first-generation students.


2. Speak with your counselor about local college-bound programs.


You high school counselor can help put you in touch with 
 programs that are available in your hometown. These federally funded programs are designed specifically to help lower-income, first-generation students with services that may be hard to find elsewhere, like college advising and mentoring, financial guidance and academic tutoring. Getting involved in one of these programs early on in high school is a great way to stay on track to earning that college diploma.


Many colleges host their own TRIO programs and work with high schools to mentor first-gen students. Joining a college’s Upward Bound program can set you up for success later and possibly better your chances of acceptance to your program’s host institution.


3. Attend fly-in programs and college fairs.


Distance shouldn’t stand between you and your dream school. If the college you’re hoping to attend is in 
, consider visiting the campus before you apply. Some schools offer so-called fly-in programs, where first-generation students “can see the school for themselves at little to no cost,” says Laura Stratton, director of admissions at Scripps College in Southern California. These visits typically include free overnight stays, information sessions and campus tours.


When attending a fly-in program isn’t possible, see if colleges will be hosting events in your area. Local college fairs are a great alternative. Admissions representatives will likely attend fairs in your state where you can learn more about the campus without venturing far from home.


Make sure to ask admissions representatives about their college’s financial aid offerings as well. If you’re planning to apply for aid, NerdScholar’s 
 will walk you through filling out the FAFSA and is especially helpful for students with nontraditional family situations.


 4. Find support among your peers and other first-generation students.


Don’t reinvent the wheel. Other first-generation students can help you navigate the application process. Speak with friends, or friends of friends, who are currently in college and ask to hear their story.


As Jones says, the challenges don’t end once you’re accepted. Attending college brings on new ones, such as enrolling in classes, 
, finding housing and searching for internships. Lean on your peers and other first-generation students who can help you through the ups and downs. They may be the best resource of all.
