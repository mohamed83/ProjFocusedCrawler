Students should think twice before taking out a student loan.

Tiffany Heikel believes she could’ve cut her undergraduate student loan debt in half if she had just done what she’s planning to do for grad school: land scholarships, pay out of pocket and avoid private student loans.


“
 is not a bad thing to invest in,” said Heikel, who graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree in psychology and is currently applying to grad schools. “I just wish I didn’t invest so much money into it…I took out more than I needed for tuition.”


According to Heikel, she owes several hundred dollars a month in repayment toward what are mostly private student loans. She regrets how she went about the entire thing.


But are private student loans all bad? No, but answering that question in your own special case requires a few considerations.


Interest rates and amounts

How much you’re able to take out varies between student loans. But generally, you can take out more money with private student loans than public ones, according to San Francisco State University student loan counselor Keina Sanchez.


“A freshman may only borrow $3,500 subsidized and $2000 unsubsidized (both for public, Stafford loans) for the school year,” Sanchez said. “With a private loan, you may borrow up to the cost of attendance if approved.”


But you may want to be careful, because interest rates are typically higher with private loans.


According to 
DailyFinance.com
, private loans are often variable, meaning “a loan that starts out charging 5 percent can — and often does — rise into double digits.” Federal loans, on the other hand, rarely change interest rates throughout the life of the loan and can be as low as 3.4% interest.


Also, with most private student loans, you accrue interest during college, unlike subsidized Stafford loans where interest doesn’t accrue until after graduation. So you end up paying more than the original amount you signed up for, sometimes significantly more.


“Reading the fine print is very important,” said Heikel, who accrued around $10,000 in associated fees alone. “I find it more true for private loans.”


Compare all the interest rates side by side, and how much you’re being offered, before making a decision.


Repayment

Repayment differs between 
.


According to the federal student aid page of the U.S. Department of Education, some private student loans require you to pay while you’re still in school, which is the total opposite of most federal student loans. And private loans may not offer forbearance, deferment, forgiveness or consolidation, so you better be ready to pay those loans back one by one pretty immediately.


To do so, Heikel worked all through college. You may have to, as well. If you don’t and can’t make the payments, it could hurt your credit. “There are several other factors that can make it harder to repay private loans,” according to 
Daily Finance
. “For example, if you’re planning to pay your loan off early in order to avoid paying extra interest, you might need to think again: Some private loans levy a prepayment penalty on borrowers who try to pay ahead.”


Don’t overlook the repayment section in the paperwork. It can make all the difference.


When to consider private student loans

Private student loans aren’t all bad. Some instances call for them, according to Sanchez.


“If higher education is important and a student has no other resources to finance their education (such as scholarships, grants and public student loans), it is an investment,” Sanchez said.


That seems to be a common response: Take out private student loans if all else fails or doesn’t suffice.


If you do take out private student loans, consider your career goals to ensure you’ll have the means to pay them off after you graduate and start working in your field. For Heikel, a lot of her salary goes toward loan repayments, which slows down her plans to travel and have fun money. She wishes she knew what she knows now back when she signed those loan papers.


“Make sure you talk to a financial aid assistant at the university you’re going to,” Heikel advised. “It’s something I didn’t do. I probably wouldn’t be in the mess I’m in if I would’ve done that. I just thought I could handle it and knew what I was doing.”


Since a college degree may be able to help you advance professionally or personally, don’t not go to school just to avoid student loans. But usually, private loans can be avoided or minimized. Make sure to thoroughly consider all of your 
 before signing those papers.
