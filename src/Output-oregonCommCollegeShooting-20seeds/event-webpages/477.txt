You too can bust out of the hackneyed “poor college student” narrative by finding on campus employment. 
 that won’t make you schlep off campus will give you experience, an hourly salary and flexible schedule. Here are six ways to do it:


1. Make a plan
 


First figure out what interests you, what will utilize your skills and where you can get the most experience, suggests Lynne Sarikas, executive director of the MBA Career Center at the D’Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University in Boston. From there you can build a list of potential opportunities for which you might be suited.


2. Apply early


On-campus positions fill up early so apply before the rush. The best time is before the semester in which you hope to start working, says Clare Tauriello, director of the career center at Mount St. Mary’s University in Emmitsburg, Maryland. If you’re looking for a job in September, inquire during the summer rather than waiting for classes to start.

“You can express interest before you need a position. But a lot of students are intimidated and don’t know where to start,” says Tara Goodfellow, managing director of Athena Educational Consultants Inc., a career and college coaching firm in Charlotte, North Carolina. She suggests going to career services to walk through the process of applying for a job or 
.


3. Apply for work-study
 


Work-study is a federal aid program that provides part-time employment to college students to help them pay for education expenses, according to the Federal Student Aid Office of the U.S. Department of Education. If you qualify, you’ll receive information on how to secure a position. You’ll work a job on campus or off that will earn you at least minimum wage for hourly work. You can work only as many hours as needed to equal the total award amount you’ve been given. To qualify you must fill out your 
. Schools award funds on a first come, first served basis, so apply for aid early.


4. Get personal


Network your way through campus by joining student organizations, chatting up your professors or visiting departments where you’re interested in working. It’s a good way to find out what jobs might be available or ones that could be coming up. Plus, when you do apply you’ll already have a rapport established.


“I always recommend students try to forge their own relationships,” says Maxcimillion Alexander, co-founder of Scholarship Superhero LLC, a company that handles questions related to college scholarships and resumes. In college, Alexander scored a job at the campus gym by networking. “I worked out a lot and made friends with the guy in the weight room and he put me in touch with his manager,” he says. “Those interactions make it easier to get a job rather than applying into a black hole.”


5. Keep your eyes, ears and mind open


Pay attention to those bulletin board fliers and online job boards and you might find a position that works for you. Be open to all kinds of jobs.


Employers want you to have a range of experiences, Tauriello says. “They want to know you showed up on time, did the work and were accountable in a professional manner in any position. That’s career development. That’s what the college journey is for.”

Some jobs might include giving tours, helping out in the library stacks or assisting professors. Ask around at the alumni center, administrative offices, tutoring center, student union, IT center, gym, dining hall or on campus child care centers to see what positions are available.


You may more easily find a paying job in a department or position you want to pursue, but moving out of your comfort zone can also benefit you. “I’ve seen a student major in psychology, but because of the skills he gained in his student position in the IT department, change his career plans and enter the information technology career field successfully,” says Patti Goff, director of the Career Education Center at Providence College in Providence, Rhode Island.
 


6. Be professional


No matter what job you apply for, maintain professionalism. Wearing nice clothes, smiling and having a firm handshake will take you further than sweats, a grimace and crossed arms any day. Bring a resume with you even if all you have to show are jobs and activities from high school.


“First impressions are made in the first eight seconds. It’s important the student goes through what they want to do in terms of approach,” Tauriello says. She suggests students go in with questions prepared. “Ask, ‘Do you have any openings? My major is ‘blank’ and I’m interested in getting a job doing ‘blank.’ Be able to articulate the goal, be pleasant, open and not pushy.”
