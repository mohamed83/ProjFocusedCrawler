A student’s journey from high school graduation to college graduation is not always clearly defined. Today, with such a wide variety of ways to earn a college degree, and with several types of degrees to choose from, that journey can feel quite challenging at times.


Students who ultimately intend to earn a bachelor’s degree, but who are unsure about what they wish to do with their future, can often benefit from several semesters of community college (perhaps even earning their associate degree). Many then move on to a four-year school. Community college can thus provide students with the opportunity to earn college credit and to acclimate to the rigor of college academics, often at a reasonable cost and with less pressure.


However, the transition from community college to university is not always a simple one. If this switch is not made carefully, problems can arise, and they can end up costing you both time and money.


If you are thinking of moving on to a four-year school from community college, keep these tips in mind:


1. Prepare for your transfer as soon as possible


It is important to begin the transfer process early on — this can help to ensure that it proceeds smoothly. Start by researching four-year colleges, and then visit those schools that you are most interested in. By now, you likely have a sense of what major you would like to pursue — consider focusing on colleges that have strong programs in that field of study.


RELATED: 


When you visit these colleges, set aside time to stop by each school’s admissions office. Schedule an appointment with an admissions counselor, and make clear your desire to transfer to his or her institution. Collect any paperwork and guidance materials that you will need to make this transfer a reality. As always, it is wise to educate yourself on the positives and negatives of each potential school before ultimately making your college transfer decision.


2. Investigate credit transfer policies


After you create a list of the four-year colleges that interest you, investigate their credit transfer policies. Certain four-year schools, especially those located in the same region or state as popular community colleges, have articulation agreements with those community colleges. An articulation agreement – which outlines course equivalencies across two or more institutions – facilitates a relatively simple transfer, where most of the classes you took in community college apply to your four-year degree.


RELATED: 


Even if your school does not have an articulation agreement, it is still possible to transfer smoothly from community college to university. In this instance, read up on which of your credits will count toward your intended degree. Besides the class itself and its compatibility with your “new” college, the grade you received and the semester that you took the course in can influence whether or not it is transferable.


3. Visit your academic adviser


One of the final transfer steps is to meet with your academic adviser to officially set the transfer process in motion. If you have questions about this process, now is an ideal time to ask them.


Speaking with your adviser can also help you compare four-year colleges. He or she may be able to recommend a school where you are more likely to thrive as a student. Your adviser can likewise secure the necessary transfer paperwork or direct you to online transfer applications. Keep a running checklist of the transfer tasks your adviser describes, so that you can easily follow a clearly defined path to a successful future at a four-year university.
