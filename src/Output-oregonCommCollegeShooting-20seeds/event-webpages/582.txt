There comes a time where many college students decide to move off of campus. As the U.S. Census Bureau 
, 25% of college students live off campus without a family member. Along with a new freedom comes the potential for making mistakes.


Here are some tips to make sure your apartment living is smooth.


1. Money, money, money


Unlike living on campus with a meal plan, living off campus can easily drain what little funds you have. Plan out your budgets to make sure you have enough for rent, late night pizza runs and to still have fun. The general 
 is to not rent a place that is more than one-third of your income. Communicate with your roommates to keep utility costs low as well.


2. Set boundaries


Chances are, you’re going to have roommates during most of your college career. Right at the beginning, have a discussion about what your 
 are for your living situation. If you’re taking a 8:30 a.m. class and need to have the shower before 7:15 a.m. — tell them! The more proactive you are early on, the more likely you can avoid awkward conflicts later.


3. Talk about significant others


If you have that “one roommate” whose significant other spends way too much time at your place, you’re not alone. Consideration and a few dashes of common sense go a long way. One awkward conversation is better than an academic year of awkwardness.


4. Find a study space


Everybody’s study habits are different, but some find it difficult to study in their apartment. If that’s the case, scope out your neighborhood for places with free Wi-Fi and enough space for your laptop and notebooks. Just remember, if a coffee shop has free Wi-Fi be a good customer and buy a new cup of coffee or a scone every few hours.


5. Have fun!


Living off campus comes with it’s own unique challenges, but with a new level of freedom. Let loose, and relax. This is your home!
