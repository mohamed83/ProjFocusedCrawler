Game day cheers, chatter and groans filled a popular bar next to the University of Missouri campus Wednesday night as students and locals watched the Chicago Blackhawks in the playoffs.


But it wasn’t quite loud enough to muffle the gunshots that rang out across the street, catching all the revelers by surprise.


University of Missouri


Shortly after 11 p.m. Wednesday, local and university police shot and killed a man, tentatively identified as a suspect of armed robbery earlier that day and a registered sex offender, in one of MU’s campus parking garages after the man shot at officers, 
 from the university.


But the university didn’t warn students about the nearby pursuit of a man 
 until dozens had already seen the man’s body on the parking garage floor.


Around 11:39 p.m. Wednesday, students received the first e-mails and texts messages about the incident through the university’s emergency alert system, MU Alert, that read, “During a search for an armed robbery Columbia Police asked MUPD for asst. Suspect engaged PD, was shot & killed.”


One of the students at the bar, junior Garrett Oligschlaeger, says he didn’t know anything was wrong until bar customers outside said they heard gunshots and police cars “swarmed” the area around the campus parking garage across the street. Soon the bar patrons were peering through the windows and across police tape at a body on the garage floor, he says.


“I don’t think anybody had any clue to what had possibly been going on,” Oligschlaeger says. “At first we didn’t know if he was dead or not, because like I said, nothing was being posted.”


About 15 or 20 minutes after the man was shot the university sent out its first alert about the incident, he says.


The university 
 for its failure to “follow established protocols and procedures in alerting the MU community in a timely manner” and not activating the alert system when local police contacted the university about the suspect’s description and possible location.


A preliminary review of the situation revealed the delay was likely caused while staff members attempted to find out the exact location of the suspect, according to the release.


Most of the time, 
 is used to update students about campus closures due to weather or to distribute tornado warnings. However, it has been used previously to warn students about suspects running from police.


In May, campus administrators 
 near campus for a man suspected of multiple break-ins and sexual assaults. The suspect later committed suicide.


For some students, however, the fatal shooting has already done its damage on their perception of campus safety.


Sophomore Emily Russell had just gone to bed in her apartment across the street from the garage when she heard multiple gunshots. Although she’s used to hearing noises from downtown, the gunfire made her jump.


“I was like ‘Oh my gosh, is it the students who are being shot at or is one of my friends hurt,” she says. “All these thoughts were going through my head. I wish MU would have let us know there was a dangerous guy on the loose. Not knowing the context of the situation made it even more stressful for me.”


It was hard to calm down that night, she says, and the effects of the stress of the shooting lingered into the morning.


“I’ve never felt unsafe on campus ever,” she says. “But I don’t know, just going outside my apartment this morning it was different. It’s just a little scary that that can happen so close to where I live and there was no warning about it.”


Oligschlaeger says he felt safe the whole time at the bar Wednesday night, but looking back on it he can only wonder how things could have gone differently.


“But now that I think about it, I probably was very unsafe,” he says. “I had no clue that they were searching for a suspect or what he looked like so if had walked through the front door of the bar I would have had no idea and it would be a completely different scenario.”
