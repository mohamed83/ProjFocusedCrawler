University of Georgia student and recent Georgia Highlands College graduate Jessi Austin recently told me that before attending community college she’d heard it was ‘a poor excuse for an education’, that it was for ‘stupid people’ and that generally it was a ‘waste of time’.


Justin Deal, who will graduate with an Associate’s in Political Science from Georgia Highlands College this spring heard some of the same biases, “I heard negative reviews about the caliber of classes, teachers, and extracurricular opportunities. Also, in some people’s opinions, going to a community college infers a second-rate education compared to a four-year institution.”


As Chris Lee, an English/Art History major from El Camino Community College, put it though, these preconceptions seem to come more from people who have never attended community college rather than from people who would know first hand.


According to the Community College Research Center 45% of undergraduate students were enrolled in a public two-year college during the 2011-2012 school year. That came out to be about 8.3 million students.


Of those students, 3.3 million are enrolled full-time and 4.8 are enrolled part time.


Money is often a big part of whether or not someone gets a ‘higher’ education. The Community College Research Center notes that 44% of low-income students (low income being defined as those families with incomes of less than $25,000 per year) attend community colleges as their first college after high school.


Apprehension of loans was one of the big reasons why I decided to go to community college over a traditional university.

Deal, who considered cost as part of their decision to go to community college over university had an interesting perspective on the student loan problem in America:


“We all know the state of student loan debt in America and how the job market is becoming oversaturated with graduating students. It really is like playing a game of Life. Either you take the path of working your entire life with slight windows of opportunity, or you bear the burden of loans in hopes that your newfound career will keep you financially afloat post-graduation. I was very apprehensive about taking out loans, and, once again, that is why I chose a cost-effective community college. It made it easier to borrow the money to fund my future career.”


According to U.S. News & World Report a year’s worth of tuition at a community college costs $5000 less annually than in-state tuition at a four year college.


For those who have a fear or apprehension of loans there seems to be justification for those feelings. According to the American Student Assistance (ASA.org) there is between $902 and $1 trillion in total outstanding student loan debt in the U.S.


All three students I talked with said they will be transferring or have already transferred to university. What’s more, they all believe that their community college experience has better prepared them for what university will require.


For Deal and Lee, you get out of community college what you put into it.


“I have networked, I have become a more effective leader, and the world is not as much of a mystery to solve. I feel able to harness the world and its offerings. I am more able to mold my future to fit my goals and desires. It is an investment only if you want it to be.” Said Deal, when asked if he thought education was an investment.


Lee also finds that the community college’s offer a unique networking opportunity.


“Community college has met my expectations and exceeded them because I’ve been able to form relationships with people who are in their professions and who are doing really well in their professions. Like just today I got to meet Victor Morina, who is a Pulitzer Prize winner and I was able to have a one hour long conversation with him through my school.”


Deal has been accepted to Columbia, Lee has been accepted to the University of California, Santa Barbara, and I myself am waiting to hear back from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California.


Hopefully the takeaway here is that despite what the naysayers think, making time at a community college part of your higher education goals will prove to be worthwhile.


J.A. Fisher: I’m a sophomore at Georgia Highlands College. I’m in pursuit of my associate’s in communications and I plan to transfer to university in the fall. In my free time I listen to copious amounts of music while reading copious amounts of comics. My main political focus is LGBTQ activism.
