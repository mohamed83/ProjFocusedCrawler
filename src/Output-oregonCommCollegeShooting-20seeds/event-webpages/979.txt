Seamus Mulcahy, 20, of Omaha, Neb., woke up at 4 a.m. last winter to a phone call from an intoxicated friend who was babbling incoherently.


About an hour later, Mulcahy arrived at a party on the opposite side of town to find his friend shaking, convulsing and vomiting. He says it was the worst case of alcohol poisoning he has ever seen.


At the time, his friend was actively enlisting in the Army. Fearing a minor in possession charge would hurt chances of successfully enlisting, his friend refused to seek medical attention at a hospital.


“I was kind of in a catch 22 because I knew (my friend) needed to go to the hospital, but they had been planning to enlist for years and years,” Mulcahy says. “I didn’t want to ruin their life plan.”

But Mulcahy says the Good Samaritan Policy will save students like him from that “catch 22” situation.


The policy, which was passed in Lincoln, Neb., in the April 2 and went into effect on Aug. 29, allows intoxicated minors to call 9-1-1 and seek medical attention for themselves or another person without being charged with an MIP.


Now, Nebraska is one of the 31 states that has adopted a medical amnesty law.


The Association of Students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (ASUN) first pursued this idea after attending a Big Ten Conference for student leaders, according to Erin Cooper, UNL graduate and former ASUN officer.


Cooper said they spent two years researching and developing the idea before bringing it to the floor. They approached Sen. Adam Morfeld, 30, of Lincoln, Neb., with the idea soon after he was elected in 2014. And he went for it.


“Even many years from college, I know there were several situations each night where young Nebraskans had to decide to get their friends medical help or be charged by the police,” Morfeld said.


While working on the bill, ASUN and Morfeld drew ideas from existing medical amnesty bills, like Minnesota’s.

Joelle Stangler, 21, of Minneapolis, Minn., says the process of enacting the bill was entirely student-led and took only a few months.


Stangler, the student body president at the University of Minnesota, says the bill was passed in August 2012, and the years since have been focused on educating the student body.


“People will say, ‘You know if you call 9-1-1 for an intoxicated friend…’ and people will respond, ‘you wont get a minor in possession,’” Stangler said. “So there’s a high level of awareness and consciousness.”

A few months after the policy was implemented in Minnesota, Stangler says she was walking through campus and came across a student who was alone and vomiting from what appeared to be alcohol poisoning. Without hesitation, she says she called emergency services and made sure the student was cared for.


“If (students) know there’s no risk whatsoever they might be more inclined not just to help their own friends, but also other people they see,” Stangler says.


Aaron Letzeiser, 26,from Novi, Mich., said he has the same vision for college campuses across the nation. That’s why he founded the 
 three years ago while he was still an undergraduate at Michigan State.


His nonprofit organization is “dedicated to the introduction, passage, and education of Medical Amnesty (Good Samaritan, 911 Lifeline, etc.) legislation throughout the United States,” according to its 
.


Letzieser says he works with students and senators from different states to create medical amnesty bills.


He, along with volunteers, provide support, data and other information schools might need throughout the process of developing a bill. And since launching the organization in June of 2012, Letzieser says he’s seen a significant increase in the amount of states adopting the policy.


“There is a lot of evidence to suggest once it passed and exists, it has the exact impact we want it to have,” Letzeiser says.


But some Nebraska law enforcement officials were skeptical at first thinking minors might abuse the bill as a “free pass” to get out of trouble, Morfeld says.


Morfeld says the language of the bill is written so minors in dire situations are only granted immunity from an MIP charge — not other crimes that may occur in relation to underage drinking.


He says he met with Lincoln, Neb., Mayor Chris Beutler, the police department and other Nebraska senators to assuage their concerns.


“This is something that has not been abused in other states, and it’s not going to be abused in Nebraska,” Morfeld says.


In the end, all senators that voted were in favor of the bill,, according to Morfeld.


“I talked to a lot of senators on this issue and every one can remember a time when they or someone they were very close to were in this exact kind of situation,” Morfeld says. “They needed medical attention and didn’t get it because they were afraid to get in trouble.”


While Mulcahy says the situation with his intoxicated friend turned out OK, he attributes it to luck.


The scenario, he says, could have easily ended differently if that 4 a.m. phone call hadn’t woken him up, or if someone hadn’t grabbed his friend’s phone to tell Mulcahy the location of the party or if his friend failed to call him in the first place.


“It all would’ve been much simpler if somebody had been very comfortable to make that (9-1-1) call,” Mulcahy says. “I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that … (the Good Samaritan Policy) is something that is going to save lives.”
