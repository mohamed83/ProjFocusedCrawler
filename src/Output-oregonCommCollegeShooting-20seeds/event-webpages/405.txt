Glass shatters around 16-year-old Sarah Taha on a weekday morning in Iraq. The van she sits in with 13 other girls was being shaken violently, as the sharp voices of terrorists engulfed the screams of the passengers.


“I truly thought I was going to die,” Taha said. “Being born and raised in Iraq, just wanting to learn, which is such a simple act, was considered a crime.”


“I can’t even tell you what it was like. Even when I was sleeping, I never felt safe. I was hoping I would die.”


Fast forward 10 years.


Taha, now 26, is sifting through various college acceptance letters from surrounding universities in California. She is pursuing a Bachelors degree in Business Administration, with hopes to achieve her Doctorate in Accounting and help those who are in the situation she was able to escape.


And, she was just named to the All-USA Community College Academic Team.


The honor comes with a $2,500 scholarship and national media coverage.

It was a long road for Taha, filled with death, relocation and a perseverance that was able to lead her into the success she is seeing today.


“I don’t feel like a great inspirational person,” she says. “I have power and I need to use it. If everyone thought this way, the world would be changing. I’m doing something, but it’s just the beginning.”


Taha grew up in Iraq, and was living in the country when American troops invaded in 2003. Her two brothers signed up to be interpreters for the U.S. and that decision ultimately led to murder of Taha’s father at the hands of terrorists. Afterwards, her family fled and Taha sunk into a deep depression during their displacement.


After being granted asylum to America, Taha’s brother suggested she return to what made her happy in Iraq: getting an education.


She landed at 
, and despite her little knowledge of English “which I got from a few American TV shows like 
Friends
 and 
Lost
,” Taha soon excelled in her math and science courses. Her professors encouraged her to expand her class load to gain a degree.


“It can best be described as my ship to salvation,” she says. “It was my first glimpse of hope and my first step towards my next life. I used to view education in the United States as unattainable but I would eventually get it. I overcome the death of my father and war in Iraq. Once I’ve done that, I can do anything.”


Now that she has left her violence-filled home, Taha wants to continue helping those still there. She is currently working with companies to import dried lemons to the U.S. She also wants to work with other businesses from her home country to help them thrive as well.


Her latest project is becoming a Regional Director of 
, which works across the world to help Iraqi orphans find safer, opportunistic homes. She has already helped one child move out of the country, and hopes to continue the work nationwide in the U.S.


“I wanted to help because this is something I’ve been through, I know their struggles,” she says. “People would see their struggles on the television but never feel them. I want to give them the confidence and the determination to move forward.”


Lending a helping hand is not something Taha likes to boast about, or even sees significance in doing. For her, it’s simply what she cares about.


“When you experience helping others, you’re not just eating and sleeping and doing nothing in life,” she says. “You’re taking an active position in life. I feel like I’m not doing something big, it’s what I love to do.”


For those in war-torn countries or at a disdvantage in life, Taha has a simple piece of advice: just keep going.


“Fight to be educated and never give up,” she says. “If you can leave this world and you’re educated, and doing great things, you will leave it peacefully.”
