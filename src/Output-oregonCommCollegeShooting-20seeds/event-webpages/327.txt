Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include new information.


Columbia, S.C. (WLTX) – The South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division says a shooting at a University of South Carolina campus building Thursday afternoon was a murder-suicide.


The shooting took place just after 1 p.m. in the Arnold School of Public Health. SLED Spokesman Thom Berry said additional information on the circumstances leading up to the shooting were not immediately available, but he did call the shooting “isolated.”


Berry would not say if the two that were dead were students or faculty.


“There was no active shooter situation, other than the two individuals that are now deceased and were involved in this situation,” he added.


Berry said Richland County Coroner Gary Watts is also investigating and may have information Thursday night or Friday morning.

The lockdown on the school’s campus has been lifted, and classes for most of the university have resumed, although some department heads made the individual decision to stop their instruction schedule.


The school sent out a Carolina Alert, its campus notification system, on e-mail and Twitter around 1:20 p.m. telling students to seek safe shelter and to obey officials.

Students News19 spoke to who were inside the building said they initially thought it was a fire drill, because they heard that alarm sound. Law enforcement then instructed them to get out of the building.


Hayden Dunn, a senior at the school, was inside the building and was leaving when he heard about the shooting.


“I got on the elevator and a policeman came into the elevator with me and asked if I had heard any gunshots,” said Dunn. “About five minutes after that the fire alarm went off and we all went outside. About three minutes later, another officer came outside and told us we needed to get as far away as possible.”


“I didn’t think that it was for real maybe, just like a drill at first,” said Kali Bishop, another senior at the school.


At 2:15 p.m., they followed up with an additional alert that said there was no longer an existing threat on campus.

Multiple buildings on campus were locked down, and students and media were about two blocks away from where the shooting was reported. The campus lockdown has been lifted.


The Arnold School of Public Health is located on Assembly Street. Assembly and College Street were shut down while police responded to the situation.


The Columbia Police Department and the U.S. Marshal’s office are assisting in the investigation.
