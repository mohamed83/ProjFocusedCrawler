Iowa State students Alec Norem and Amanda Nerem hug in front of the Parks Library on campus in Ames, where they spent 31 hours locked in each other’s embrace to notch a new world record.


AMES, Ia. — Spend a few years in journalism and you develop a love-hate relationship with 
.


Sure, the branded database of wacky superlatives can make a young reporter’s life more interesting. Everyday people attempt extreme or just plain weird feats; cap off your account with a catchy headline and — congratulations — you just successfully avoided covering another boring committee meeting.


But this is different. Iowa State University students Amanda Nerem and Alec Norem get a pass for their recent Guinness stunt. Their brainstorm led to this past weekend when Amanda, 19, and Alec, 20, became even closer — some would suspect awkwardly closer — friends: They spent a record 
 in front of the campus library.


I completely understand their motivation: They were nothing more than two bored young adults in small-town Iowa who dreamed this up in the middle of a dull summer day.


It’s only appropriate that their surnames are one letter apart: These two have been platonic best friends since at least fifth grade. They hail from tiny neighboring towns in north central Iowa — he’s from Goldfield, she’s from Renwick — and graduated from a high school class of no more than 80 students in nearby Clarion.


There’s not much to distract them back home during summer break, they explained. The two were hanging out at Amanda’s house in Renwick one evening after work; most of their other friends were away. What if they tried to break a world record?


They noticed that the 
 had been notched five years ago in Canada by a couple that lasted 24 hours and 33 minutes.


Perfect: Their personal mission also could be patriotic as they claimed the record hug on behalf of the United States.


Approval for their attempt from Guinness took about six weeks, which is why Amanda and Alec ended up hugging in Ames. (Guinness has parameters for what records it tracks and approves applications for attempts to break existing records.)


Finally, they locked themselves in each other’s arms at 6 p.m. Friday on the steps of Parks Library and didn’t let go until 1 a.m. Sunday.


They rented cameras from ISU to record their epic embrace and bought a supply of Lunchables and granola bars. They swigged energy drinks to help stay awake.


“We should’ve planned this a lot better than we did, honestly,” Amanda admitted.


Getting approval from campus officials was funny enough. (Try to sound serious on the phone while explaining a marathon public hug.) At least there’s Guinness World Record precedent at ISU: 
was made in 2001 during Veishea.


By rules Alec and Amanda had no more than five minutes each hour for a quick bathroom break and to stretch — or to collapse flat on the ground to rest their weary legs.


At least two witnesses had to observe them at all times, but no witness could be used for more than four hours.


And what’s this I heard about an emergency potty bucket? Precisely how did that work?


“We just had it there just in case,” Amanda clarified, “but we did not use it.”


Otherwise the friends had to lock arms and remain rooted to the same spot.


Their muscles tensed up in the overnight chill.


“The wrists were the first thing that hurt on me,” Amanda said. “It was the weirdest thing.”


Amanda is a sophomore in kinesiology and health.


But Alec is a sophomore in advertising. His dream job is to work promotions for Universal Studios.


Skeptical question No. 1: Was this some sort of sly experiment in viral marketing?


No, they reassured me. It was nothing more than rural Iowans’ creative solution to boredom.


Skeptical question No. 2: Wasn’t it the least bit sexually awkward to press their bodies together for so long?


People online even speculated that the hug was prelude to a marriage proposal.


Again, no. Alec, not currently in a relationship, is good friends with Amanda’s boyfriend. The two live next door to each other among a group of friends in in a pair of apartments with connecting balconies. I politely pried into their private lives as much as possible, but their ultimate message is that they know each other too well to feel uncomfortable.


“We’re just that close of friends,” Amanda said.


But they did get frustrated with each other. The dark, cold wee hours of Saturday morning were the worst: Amanda began to sag against Alec; the couple swayed unsteadily.


They endured. They quoted 
SpongeBob SquarePants
 (their favorite TV show) to each other.


They watched YouTube videos, Netflix. Their other friends played video games to distract them.


The stunt had to be in a public place, but they could have done this indoors. If Guinness doesn’t approve their documentation for this hug, they’re determined to try again — albeit in a climate-controlled spot.


Didn’t they learn anything new about each other during those 31 hours, I wondered?


“I think we just got closer somehow, someway in that embrace,” Alec said.


In more ways than one, no doubt.


I’m just glad they didn’t have to use the bucket.
