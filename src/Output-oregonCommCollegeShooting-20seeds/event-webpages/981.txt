The 
 announced on Saturday that it has re-entered the business of helping students find their dream schools with the roll out of an updated online hub of information about colleges.


The White House Scorecard aims to give students and families a more objective look at universities than other websites that rank institutions, the release said. The relaunched College Scorecard adds more forward-looking data to the controversial website that officials abandoned in June, like estimated salary outlooks for six and 10 years after students enroll in schools.


The updated system continues to provide information including tuition costs, financial aid opportunities, degree plans and some admission requirements, just like the previous Scorecard site. Eleven other federal organizations are also going to pull information from the Scorecard, including PayScale, a salary database that ranks returns on investments for college educations, the release said.


The relaunch comes days after 
U.S. News and World Report
 released its annual university 
. President Barack Obama 
 a ranking system like the 
U.S. News and World Report
‘s “doesn’t serve our students well” in a weekly address on Saturday.

“The status quo serves some colleges and the companies that rank them just fine,” Obama said in the address. “There are colleges dedicated to helping students of all backgrounds learn without saddling them with debt. We should hold everybody to that standard.”


But don’t expect to see colleges ranked by number like 
U.S. News and World Report
’s list because the Scorecard doesn’t have numerical rankings.


The data centers around college affordability, one of Obama’s 
 in his push for tuition-free community college.


The revived interface and database comes after some believed federal official don’t have the capacity to build a fair system to judge colleges, 
. Before the first iteration of the website launched in June, for instance, Education Secretary Arne Duncan 
 the website “more than a little silly.”
