Last week, the President Obama unveiled his 
 to make the first two years of community college and technical school free for part and full-time students. The proposal was met with some hesitation, with many asking how it would be funded and questioning the likelihood of congressional approval.








































If implemented, how will the program affect students, community colleges and other institutions? Here are three questions we have about Obama’s proposal:


What effect would this have on college enrollment rates?


In the aftermath of the recession, the number of students enrolling in community colleges increased, in part due to lower attendance costs. The same thing will likely occur following this proposal. But exactly how much of an increase can we expect?

With
 nationwide, it’s likely that four-year public colleges will see a drop in enrollment. But it’s unclear how severe that drop might be, not to mention how large of an effect it could have on school budgets and expenditures.


What happens if someone doesn’t complete his or her education?


As the President noted in his Jan. 9 speech, community colleges provide individuals with financial, familial or personal commitments a chance to get an education despite the hurdles they may face.


Many community college students drop out for personal reasons. According to the 
, only 31% of those entered in a two-year program will graduate within three years. If financial reasons aren’t the primary reason why most people drop out, there’s concern that this proposal won’t do much to improve completion rates, and that the money might be better spent elsewhere.


What effect would this have on education quality?


Under the President’s plan, funds provided to community colleges will be based on performance. But it’s possible this proposal will actually harm quality.


Related: 


With increased pressure to improve graduation rates, schools might be incentivized to inflate grades in the hopes of getting additional federal and state funding. If that happens, students could graduate without the knowledge or skills needed to succeed at a four-year college or in the workforce.
