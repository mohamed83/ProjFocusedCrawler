Students break the bank to buy their books

Going by the book has never been easy. For college students today, it often means busting the budget.


For Megan Kavanaugh, a junior studying mechanical engineering at Oakland University in Rochester, Mich., her standard 16-credit semester’s required supplies list from the university bookstore this winter totaled just under $900. And that’s without the additional $200-worth of recommended materials.


“I get that someone writes the book and has to be paid,” she says. “But I just don’t think they should be so expensive.”










To cut costs, Kavanaugh sought alternate, cheaper sources to acquire her supplies.


“I bought one book off of someone, rented one, and bought another one off of Amazon,” Kavanaugh says. “A lot of times we don’t actually even use the book, so I usually wait after the first week of class to buy anything to see if we’ll actually need it.”

According to a 
 by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (USPIRG), as of Jan. 27, 2014, the average American college student spends $1,200 per year on books and supplies, which is equivalent to 39% of tuition and fees at a community college and 14% tuition and fees at a four-year university.


By these numbers, it is estimated that the average student will spend $4,800 on textbooks and supplies by the end of his or her undergraduate stay—even more if the program requires five or six years of education.


The study asserts that “publishers keep costs high by pumping out new editions and selling books bundled with software.” This is something Rona Jin, a junior studying psychology at the University of Michigan, faced firsthand when she was forced to fork over $244 for the newest edition of a cognitive psychology book software bundle for a class.

While Jin ultimately bit the bullet to buy the book, according to the USPIRG, 65% of college students have opted to forgo purchasing class texts “because it was too expensive.” Of these students, 94% had concerns that doing so “would hurt their grade in a course.” The study concludes that the high prices of the books ultimately affect students’ decisions on the number and type of classes they take each semester.


At a time when the average U.S. student is receiving a diploma alongside $33,000 in student loan debt, 
, reducing the price tag of higher education seems to have become a top national priority. Just last week President Obama announced a 
 to make two years of community college free for those “willing to work for it”.


The hefty price of textbooks has yet to be mentioned in this battle of the budget.


“I think it’s ridiculous,” says Kavanaugh. “The university is making enough money from tuition and other things. They shouldn’t be able to earn a profit from us buying the books we need.”
