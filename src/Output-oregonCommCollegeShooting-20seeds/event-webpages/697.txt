Whoo gets discounts from all kinds of places? You do, college student, you do.


Being a college student isn’t cheap.


Between nights out with friends, lunch with your roommate, the occasional movie, groceries, toiletries and annual tuition, your expenses can add up quickly.


There are a ton of stores out there that feel your pain, though. Many offer you a break via student discounts.


Keep these establishments in mind next time you’re looking to do some smart shopping and save some cash:


Apparel


— 
: Finally be able to afford some clothes for work or your internship with 15% off full-priced items in the store.


— 
: Stock up on some fall favorites by getting 20% off regular and sale priced items in any Club Monaco store and online.


— 
: Whether it’s outdoorsy clothing basics or camping equipment, you can get 15% off regular priced items in stores with your ID.


— 
: Think you can’t afford Ralph Lauren? Get some discounted swag when you flash your ID for a 15% discount.


Food


— Papa John’s: Pizza is a perfect option for any fast-paced student. Papa John’s discounts vary based on location, so ask the restaurant closest to your campus what discount they offer.


— Qdoba: Qdoba offers a free drink for students when you purchase a meal as well as burrito meals for $5.


— Subway: At Subway, you can eat fresher with a 10% discount when you flash your student ID.


— Waffle House: Breakfast is cheaper when you add this 10% discount with a student ID.


Technology


— Apple: Want an iPhone 5 for less? Students can get an 8% discount online and in Apple stores on all Apple products.


— Dell University: A program through Dell that offers discounts on technology for students.


Transportation

Many stores offer student discounts, even if they don’t broadcast them.


If you’re not sure whether or not a store offers a discount, go ahead and ask. You may end up finding more deals than you were bargaining for.


And always carry your student ID!
