In seventh grade, Hayden Dahmm created a little bit of electricity.


For a science competition, Dahmm built a small solar collector out of a soda bottle and some pieces of copper that he had oxidized on a hot plate. It emitted a couple of microwatts — and ignited a passion that will soon power him across the Atlantic Ocean.


Dahmm, 22, an honors engineering major at Pennsylvania’s 
, will receive his diploma Sunday at the school’s commencement ceremony. Soon after, he will head to Britain through 
 to obtain his master’s degree in sustainable energy futures.


During a recent interview, he described himself in five main ways. “I’m a Swarthmore student,” he said. “I’m an engineer. I’m a nerd. I like science. And I’m blind.”


His lack of functional vision is a part of his identity, but there is a reason it appears last on his list.


“Blindness is just an attribute I happen to have,” said Dahmm. “It doesn’t define who I am. I’m just like everybody else. The only difference is that sometimes I need to take in information in different ways.”


Atop his own intellect and hard work, Dahmm has succeeded academically over the past four years through a mix of human and animal kindness, technological innovation and even actual building blocks.


For example, in respect to the latter, in summer 2012 he worked with Swarthmore engineering professor 
 to create a learning aid partially comprised of repurposed parts from popular K’NEX building sets.


As Dahmm explained, “We took the plastic rods that you snap into the stars and we placed these plastic elements we made on a 3D printer on them to represent the resistors, capacitors, conductors and other things you’d find in an electrical circuit. I can then snap these together to form whatever electrical diagram I want to make. It allowed me to do things that my sighted peers could do with just a pad and pencil.”


Dahmm and Everbach subsequently collaborated on a more ambitious project aimed at presenting complex data displays in a way Dahmm could understand. The pair named their finished program Sound Plot. It’s an audio adaptation of mathematical diagrams, including those known as 
.


Dahmm patiently explained the program to me in (almost) layman’s terms:


“If you’re collecting data in a lab, you might be looking at how the force on a block changes with time. You would represent that with a graph. You’d have the ‘force’ on the Y axis and the ‘time’ on the X axis. And you could understand visually how that changes. But for me, we had to work to find a way that we could represent that through sound. So we took a trackpad … which is used for sound processing. Then we hooked it up with an engineering program. So if I install a data file, I can experience the data by running my finger over the trackpad and the computer works to understand where my finger is positioned and then figures out what that corresponds to on the visual plot and makes a sound corresponding to the data value. So if it’s a high data value it puts out a high frequency and if it’s a low data value it puts out a low frequency.”


Prior to his work with data, Dahmm dabbled in the visual arts. Born along with his twin brother Ethan more than three months premature and beset by a range of complications including severe visual impairment, Dahmm has never seen himself as a hero. But he did create one.


As an eight-year-old in Delaware County, Pa., Dahmm designed a comic book featuring a do-gooder toilet as the superhero star.


Inspired by 
 book series, Dahmm said the unnamed crime-fighting commode “occupies this world made out of inanimate objects. [In the first book] he has to fight two candlesticks who have robbed a bank. … He drives around in a toilet tank and the police commissioner is a roll of toilet paper and his girlfriend is a bidet.”


Dahmm drew and sold printed copies of the first book in the series soon after the September 11th terrorist attacks, raising more than $10,000 for victims and their families. Proceeds from the sales of later installments went to help free child slaves in Africa and to establish a memorial scholarship for his father, who died of a heart attack when Dahmm was 12.

One real-life hero during Dahmm’s time at Swarthmore has been Fathom, a guide dog trained by 
 organization in New Jersey. Dahmm calls Fathom “my best friend and a constant source of comfort and love who I couldn’t imagine going through Swarthmore without.”


As he shared in 
 with The Seeing Eye, “Fathom and I were actually teamed up on Independence Day 2012. And in my fight for independence, Fathom is like my George Washington. He really leads the way and helps me do things I could not do otherwise and allows me to feel more independent self-confident.”


For his efforts, Fathom recently received an honorary certificate of appreciation from the college registrar. He will also walk with Dahmm at commencement — wearing a bow tie and his own graduation cap.


While pursuing his degree, Dahmm has also been beholden to his “homework whisperers” — a small set of classmates and an adjunct professor with whom he met regularly each semester.


“They’ve helped me read assignments that are not legible to me due to graphics or mathematical equations being present in the documents,” he said. “Sometimes I’ll also need help drawing out diagrams or writing equations or doing other things that are visually based. So they help me get through that. It’s all my brain, but they serve as my eyes.”


Upon graduation and his subsequent relocation to 
, Dahmm is excited to continue exerting his brainpower toward using the tools of engineering to make energy generation more sustainable.


As he asked, “How can we become less dependent on all this consumerism that generates waste? How can we become a better society that is not as destructive toward the environment? Instead of having no harm, how can we have a positive effect? … If everyone was to look at their lives, they’ve had to face things no matter who they are. I think my story underlines that we can all fix our challenges better if we come together as a community and just work to help one another.”
