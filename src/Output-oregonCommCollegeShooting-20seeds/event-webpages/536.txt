Finances have always proved challenging for college kids who are just starting to live on their own. But how far would you go to save some money? One 24-year-old University of Manchester student took it to the extreme by living in a tent for an entire academic year.


Evan Eames — originally from Montreal — posted an appeal on various social media sites asking, “Can I live in your backyard for a year?” With a 
 (approximately 
) tuition to pay for his Master’s degree in astrophysics, Eames 
 he couldn’t afford to add residential fees to that bill.


RELATED: 


In his appeal, Eames offered to act as extra security and do the dishes for his host. The added bonus? His host would get to brag about having a Canadian physicist living in his or her backyard.




Luckily, Eames received an offer. After noticing the appeal on 
, a UK classified advertisements website, 34-year-old Charley Mantack volunteered her backyard in Heaton Chapel, Stockport in Northern England. In exchange for Mantack’s backyard, Eames also agreed to help tutor her in math and physics for her 
, or GCSE.


Eames faced cold winter months full of rain and snow, sheltered by the thin layer of his tent. According to the 
, Eames stayed warm by wearing two pairs of thermal pants, a sweater, a onesie and a jacket.


Eames was able to stay clean by using the shower and toilet facilities at his school. When answering questions by users on 
, Eames said that he did use the garden a few times, but maintains that he was “on good terms with his bladder.”


Eames also said that he used Mantack’s shower once, but only when he first arrived. On the same Reddit 
, Eames said that he sometimes watched TV with Mantack and used her washing machine, though he tried to stick to his tent to avoid imposing on her.


“Seeing as I wasn’t paying rent, I would have felt somewhat guilty living in their house,” he wrote on Reddit. “The owner many times offered her sofa, especially on the cold nights, but I was quite cosy in my tent, and didn’t want to impose.”


According to 
, after spending a total of 10 months in a tent, Mantack said he is more than glad he made this decision; he saved a lot of money and has a great story to tell. Eames 
 that there was one incident where he almost called it quits due to a snowstorm that flipped his tent over, but said the overall experience was “really fun.”

Eames told the 
: “There [were] some days I would wake up, there was birds around and reeds blowing in the wind, or you could hear the pitter-pattering on top of the tent some days of the rain, it was really enjoyable.”
