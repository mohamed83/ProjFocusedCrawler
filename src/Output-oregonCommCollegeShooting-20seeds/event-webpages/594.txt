Colorado State University-Pueblo mass communications major Mike Marino authored his first two books  — 
Campus-Preneur: How to Have More Fun, More Money, and Survive College Without Starving To Death
 and 
Straight Talk for Student Success
 all before graduating.


Known as a ‘leading authority in student success,’ Marino has spoken at a wide variety of colleges including a recent visit to Pennsylvania State University. He enjoys speaking to students about how they also can achieve being successful in their own unique way before they graduate.


Marino hopes to see students find the success that they are looking for whether it comes while they are still in college or after graduation.
