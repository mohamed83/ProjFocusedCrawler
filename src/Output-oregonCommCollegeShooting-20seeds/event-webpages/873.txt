Millersville University students are in shock after 18-year-old freshman Karlie Hall was found dead in her Lancaster, Pa., dorm room early Sunday morning.


Hall’s boyfriend, 19-year-old Gregorio Orrostieta, 
 after an autopsy revealed Hall suffered injuries from a beating and was strangled.


Orrostieta, who is not a Millersville University student, told police Hall hit him after the pair argued at a party. The two made up and returned to the dorm around 1:30 a.m., but engaged in a second physical altercation in which Orrostieta shoved Hall, causing her to fall and hit her head on a chair before he gave her a “back hand” to the face, the affidavit said.


Hall was found unresponsive after Orrostieta called police around 5:20 a.m.


Hall was from Chadds Ford, Pa. and attended Millersville University with her twin sister, Kristin.


The university sent two emails on Sunday to students regarding Hall’s death — the first around 3 p.m. and the second at 11:30 p.m.

President John Anderson provided students details about the incident from the Lancaster District Attorney’s Office as well as where to seek counseling services and spiritual guidance on campus. Anderson asked students to keep Hall’s family in their thoughts and prayers.

Casey Knapp, a senior communications studies major, says she was shocked to hear how police believe the crime was committed.


“Hearing that Karlie’s death may have been caused by someone close to her put me at a loss for words even though I did not know Karlie personally,” Knapp says.


Curtis Silverwood, a senior majoring in meteorology and speech communications, says it’s unsettling to know such a violent incident happened on campus.


“It is just a scary thing to think about happening where I’ve spent the past four years of my life,” says Silverwood, who is also a former peer mentor at Bard Hall.


“I’m aware that domestic violence happens everywhere and most always behind closed doors,” says Vassana Mee, a junior majoring in speech communications and public relations. “To be honest, having it happen right down the street from me does upset me in ways I can’t really put into words.”


Amanda McFadden, a senior art education major and former resident of Bard Hall, says she was “heartsick” to learn of Hall’s death.


“She is not a campus story or statistic,” says McFadden about Hall. “She is a human being who was robbed of a bright future.”
