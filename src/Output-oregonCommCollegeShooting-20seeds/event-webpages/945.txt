Much has occurred since the
 took place at The University of Oklahoma earlier this month. After the 10 second video of the fraternity brothers singing a racist song that advocated lynching African-Americans, rather than accepting them, went viral, the fraternity’s national organization
 of OU’s SAE fraternity and 
 have been spotlighted.


But what has made recent headlines was the 
 by OU President David Boren and questions of legality surrounding the student’s first amendment right to free speech.


According to OU’s
, abusive conduct is listed as:


“Unwelcome conduct that is sufficiently severe and pervasive that it alters the conditions of education or employment and creates an environment that a reasonable person would find intimidating, harassing or humiliating. These circumstances could include the frequency of the conduct, its severity, and whether it is threatening or humiliating…Simple teasing, offhanded comments and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to abusive conduct.”


According to these rules, the students could be sanctioned with expulsion. In SAE’s video, abusive language was being directed toward a particular group of students (i.e. African-Americans who wanted to pledge their fraternity). That chant was more than just a casually recited song meant to invoke a sense of brotherhood amongst those in the chapter. And the meaning and significance behind the words in the chant did more than just offend a few students.


As Boren mentioned, the attack on black people that SAE alluded to could make students feel unsafe in a learning environment. After numerous 
 experienced 
, students may feel intimidated by verbal attacks from white students.


However, some have argued that the students should at least have a fair shot at defending themselves after gleefully chanting that they’d rather let someone “hang [n-word] from a tree” than let them join their fraternity on video. I mean, to be fair, they didn’t 
know
 they were on video.


The problem with this argument is that, in fact, they did have this shot.

In a tweet by an OU senior, the supposed expulsion letter for the two chant leaders shows that they were given the opportunity to appeal the decision in the days prior to being expelled. Students of the now defunct fraternity chapter will probably leave that out of press conferences as 
.


Logically, these students’ expulsion is possible because they created an intimidating, hostile and exclusionary environment for their black peers. Given their extreme language, President Boren had the authority to do this even if he had believed this was an isolated incident. However, we know that it was not.


In the last two years alone, 
 five Greek organizations have been suspended and two have either been closed or banned due to racially intolerant behavior.


In fact, for SAE this is not the first time they have been accused of racist behavior towards African-Americans. While they have over 200 total chapters that, for the most part, seem to have a decent reputation on most college campuses, they have been held responsible for various incidents throughout the years.


, in 1982 members from the chapter at The University of Cincinnati were suspended for throwing a racist Martin Luther King Jr. party. Party goers were encouraged to bring items such as cancelled welfare checks, their fathers “if (they knew) who he (was)” and a radio “bigger than your head.”


In light of recent events, 
 into the University of Texas and Louisiana Tech after hearing that students at these schools sang or knew of the song sung by Oklahoma University students.


According to the Associated Press, the board of trustees and alumni of 
 that the chant appeared “three to four years ago and was not immediately and totally stopped.”


The idea that we live in a post-racial society can and should be accepted as fictitious. For anyone to believe racism is over, they must remain blind to the ways that opportunities have been withheld from people of color based on the narrow-thinking of prejudice.


For example, even in a college setting where students of color are getting the opportunity to better themselves educationally, they’re often met with resistance from predominantly white, and sometimes upper-class, members of Greek life who unfortunately can use negative stereotypes and assumptions about black students to exclude them from joining their organizations.


For months now, for years, really, a movement has been boiling to bring justice for those black bodies brought down unjustly in the streets. The names of these men, women and trans people are too many to list here: there have been children 
 or 
, there have been those walking down the street with 
, allegedly 
, or looking for help only to be 
.


The students who sang that heinous song had no way of knowing that, less than two weeks later, that a
, in a scene that would recall some of this nation’s most fervent racial animosity.


As terrible as they may be, these issues extend far beyond the edges of any one campus. Moreover, they unfortunately extend beyond the prejudice and discrimination of a few individuals. The singing of racist songs — the unnecessary violence — they are symptomatic of a larger, more subtly and fundamentally engrained problem in the American system.


What President Boren did was not only legally sound, it was imperative in order to stop the symptom from perpetuating the disease. There can be no refuge for the kind of behavior exhibited by those students and perhaps acted out on Otis Byrd in Mississippi. As uncomfortable as it may be for some, this country and its institutions are going to have to take action against the reprehensible behavior that is meant to uphold some while dehumanizing others.


There’s enough blame for this behavior to go around. As abhorrent as the action taken by the students in SAE were, they should be used as one more catalyst to enact the change necessary to transform a country steeped in white supremacy into the land of equality it has always maintained that it is. In order to prevent incidents like these from happening in learning environments and in the streets of the United States, we must affirm that justice and compassion for each other are the strings that hold together civil society.


The alternative is perfecting this racial dystopia we are in with vigilante violence.
