To succeed in college, you need more than just motivation and perseverance to get things done. You also need a supportive environment — conducive to efficiency and success to complement your hardworking nature as a student, right?


So, what exactly might you need? Here are 10 suggestions.


1. Bluetooth speakers


If music is the only way you survive long days heavy with classes and studying, bluetooth speakers will make a fantastic addition to your apartment. You can play your tunes straight from a smartphone or any other bluetooth-enabled music device.


Bluetooth speakers are a huge upgrade on those tiny smartphone or laptop speakers.


You can even get Bluetooth speakers customized for your school — like these at shown at the CES Convention in Las Vegas Convention Center (Photo: David Becker/Getty Images)


2. Large desk or table


College has a way of requiring a lot from students, materials-wise. It seems you’ve always got a mass of textbooks and notebooks around when you need to study. The best way to keep track of important materials and stay afloat is as simple as having a big workspace.


A large span of surface area will really matter when you need to spread out your flashcards and test your knowledge of cell membranes —  or when you have to compare multiple sources for an argumentative essay.


3. Dry erase board


Dry erase boards are basically the key to life itself. They save paper when doing scratch work, they’re easily cleaned and customized, and they’re all-around convenient for working through complicated math problems, making shopping lists — and writing down inspirational quotes to keep you going.


They’re also perfect for when you want to hold review sessions at your apartment, since your group can use dry erase boards to illustrate a tricky chemical structure or design an outline for a project.

4. File box


It feels so “adult” to talk about file boxes.


File boxes are actually life savers in a college apartment. When was the last time you needed your original birth certificate to get a blue card for a work-study job, but could only find copies? What about the time you were asked to provide a letter of recommendation for an internship application, but you couldn’t ever find the sweet letter your calculus professor wrote you two months ago?


If you’re constantly losing critical documents or simply forgetting where you stashed them (likely in a “safe place” so safe it jumped your memory), a file box is absolutely critical for easy document organization. You can buy various types of dividers to separate different sections of your file box into folders for recommendation letters, certificates and awards or just about anything important.


5. Label maker


Label makers come in handy for academic and non-academic use. If you have housemates who seem to always mix up their phone charger with yours, or who tend to eat the container of leftover macaroni and cheese you were saving for yourself, a label maker can help.


Labels go a long way in keeping you successful as a student, since you’ll know which folder is for receipts and which folder is for copies of your resume. When everything is clearly labeled (and in the file box you hopefully have handy), you eliminate the hassle of tracking down papers that you may not have all day to locate.

Surely you’d rather catch a movie with your cute lab partner than stay home scrambling to find a tax document due in 24 hours for financial aid applications.


6. Bookshelf 


You really can’t get by without a bookshelf in your apartment if you expect to be a highly-functioning college student. The habit of tossing books on top of other books on the floor in an apartment can lead to not only an unsightly book tower (your apartment shouldn’t look like a 24/7 game of Jenga), but can also constitute a tripping hazard if you get too comfortable leaving books all over the floor.


7. Lockable storage containers


Clear plastic storage containers are great, but they’re even better when they can stack on top of each other and lock into one single unit that can be broken down and recombined. Locking containers allow you to store something different in each separate container, and use each container as separate units; when it comes time to move into new housing or transport your storage containers, you’ll be thankful they lock together into one movable piece!


8. Lap desk


Lap desks (basically flat surfaces with a cushiony pillow stuck underneath) are great to have in an apartment. You never know when or where you’ll need a flat surface, so it’s great to have a portable desktop in case you need a makeshift desk on the couch, or even in bed if you get sick and still need to study.


9. Aesthetic elements


Wind chimes, table fountain, white noise machine, a small vase of flowers — any of these calming items can have a grounding effect on a person. And college students need all the calm they can get. To make your apartment a pleasant workspace, add some pleasing items to the rooms in which you spend the most time.


Unless you happen to be irritated by all kinds of noise (even “good” noise), add some natural noisemakers to your apartment. For many people, trickling water or the sound of breeze floating through a pretty set of wind chimes serves as a great reminder to slow down and stay calm.


10. Air ionizer


You know the feeling where you can’t seem to focus and you don’t know why? It may actually be because of too many positive ions in the air making you feel unsettled.


Negative ions are known to make people feel good, promoting wellness and health (think beach or mountain air).


 by distributing electrons that bond with air molecules to make ions; negative ions attach to dust and other pollutants that may be irritating you, and filter through the ionizer to clean the air.


An ionizer in your apartment could be the solution you never considered for making your environment peaceful and clean.


An apartment that both feels good and contains everything you need for school can only help you meet the multiple demands of college.
