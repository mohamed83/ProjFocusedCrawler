Grey smog surrounds the Eiffel Tower last week in Paris (Photo by Natalie Marshall)


Study abroad students Analise Kump (Stonehill College) , Jennifer Ihnacik (Arcadia University)  and Rebecca Parra (Saint Michael’s College) have noticed over the last week that skies in their host city, Paris, were greyer than usual.


“You could feel the thick air,” says Parra.


They also noticed that some people were walking around wearing surgical masks.


It was not until they arrived in the metro station on Saturday, March 21 and heard an announcement about free public transport due to pollution that they realized what was happening. The skies weren’t dark because of the recent solar eclipse.


It was smog from pollution.


 , Paris very briefly came out on top of the world charts for air pollution on Wednesday, March 18. In response to the high levels of pollution — which were much higher than the 
 — the city issued a partial driving ban and made public transport within the Île-de-France region free for three days.


France 24 also reported that Paris is looking for long term solutions to pollution, including potentially banning the most polluting cars and trucks, upgrading the public transport system, and reducing the number of private vehicles on the street.


Ihnacik is pleased with the city’s response to the pollution problem.


“I think Paris had a good emergency response and I hope the long-term plans to reduce pollution are successful. This city is too beautiful to be covered in smog.”


Parra agrees that Paris responded well to the pollution.


“I think they reacted efficiently. I got one of the public Vélib’ bikes and didn’t have to pay for the rental like you usually do. I don’t know if you’d ever see this response in New York.”


Parra is also impressed with how well Paris conveyed the message to visitors in the city.


“Paris is one of the most popular tourist destinations, and the city made it really easy for tourists to understand the temporary measures the city was taking against pollution. There were announcements and signs in French, but I also saw signs in English.”


Kump, however, thinks Paris needs to put more long-term plans into effect.


“I think the city made great immediate changes and I think Paris’s long-term ideas are good, but I feel like they’re going to have to do something more. They can’t make public transport free forever.”


Kump also worries about the effects the pollution will have on people’s health in the long run.


“On one hand, I probably won’t be directly affected by these few days of high pollution levels in Paris, but in the long run, we’re all going to be affected by pollution in cities everywhere.”


But the students are not concerned when it comes to the rest of their time abroad in Paris, as the pollution levels are not always through the roof.


“This is a temporary spike in pollution levels. I have been here for almost eight months and current conditions are very unusual for this city,” says Ihnacik. “I am not worried for my health, and the temporary spike in pollution levels is not going to change my daily life.”


You won’t find Parra wearing a surgical mask, either.


“I’m not in any way concerned about my health,” she says.


The students noticed that since Monday of this week, the smog has been slowly clearing


“After the driving bans and free transportation on the weekend, the skies returned to blue on Monday,” says Ihnacik.
