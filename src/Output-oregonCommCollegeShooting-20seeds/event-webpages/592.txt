As a new week begins, a pressing question continues to buzz not only in Philadelphia, but across the nation: Where is Shane Montgomery?


After 19 days full of strenuous hours 
 the town of Manayunk and the nearby Schuylkill River, there has not been any luck in finding the 21-year-old West Chester University student who went missing on Thanksgiving Eve.

“If love could rescue Shane Montgomery, he’d have been home by dinner on Thanksgiving,” wrote Ronnie Polaneczky in 
 for 
Philly.com
.


In theory, this statement is as true as it gets: family and friends have not stopped looking for Shane, and their motivation has inspired over 400 volunteers in the area to help in the search.


On Dec. 9, the Montgomery family announced a reward of $65,000 for “reliable information” on the whereabouts of Shane.


In addition to spreading awareness — through social media, press coverage and wearing green ribbons throughout town — the family hopes that this reward money will help bring Shane home.


Police have obtained a surveillance video from Christy’s Nail Salon — located on Main Street in Philadelphia next to Kildare’s Pub where Shane was last seen — of Shane walking toward a footpath over the Manayunk Canal, according to 
.


Due to this video and additional tips, police have refocused their search to the Manayunk Canal and the Schuylkill River.


Authorities say Shane became separated from his friends and was escorted out of Kildare’s Pub by a bouncer at 2 a.m. Thanksgiving morning after stumbling on a bar stool. He is a liberal arts major, 5-foot-11 and 140 pounds, with short brown hair and green eyes.

West Chester University President Greg R. Weisenstein issued a statement on Dec. 1 that read, “The Counseling Center and Student Affairs staff stand ready to provide the WCU community with counseling and support…Again, please keep Shane and his family in your thoughts. We will communicate additional information as it becomes available.”


Anybody who may know details on the whereabouts of Shane Montgomery is encouraged to contact Kevin Verbrugghe at 267-304-0864, or email bringshanehome@gmail.com.
