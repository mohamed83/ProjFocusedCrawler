Simmons becomes latest women’s college to admit transgender students

Danny Boucher was born a female. Now, at 21 years old, he identifies as a transgender male — and is a junior at Simmons College, an all-women’s university.


“As an out transgender guy, I have never once worried about being kicked out of school for this,” said Boucher. 


A new regulation at his school ensures that he won’t have to.


Simmons, located in in Boston, formally adopted an admissions policy last week that allows students who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming to attend the historically all-female institution. It becomes the third US women’s college to create a more inclusive policy, which extends admission to some students who were born male.

)


President Helen Drinan believes society is changing, the way individuals define themselves is evolving and the policy change is meant to reflect that.


“As an institution that values inclusion, Simmons College acknowledges this reality and believes that this policy is aligned with our values,” she wrote in a statement. “We are a campus community that supports a full range of gender identity and expression.”


The term “transgender” is explicitly defined as an umbrella term for people whose gender expression or behavior does not conform with that typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth, according to the American Psychological Association. 


The policy change at Simmons — a private college with roughly 1,900 undergraduates —  was announced in the midst of 
, celebrated annually throughout November.


Under Simmons’ policy, the school will accept students born female, regardless of current gender identity. They will also accept students who were born male but now identify themselves as female. 


They will not accept students who were born male but do not identify as male or female, or students born male who identify as male. 


The school’s website says that undergraduate applicants are not required to provide government-issued identification proving their assigned gender identity. The policy also only applies to their undergraduate programs, because their graduate program already accepts both females and males.


Students already enrolled, like Boucher, will be awarded a degree even if their gender identity has changed, according to Sarah Neill, Vice President for Student Affairs. 


The school has also discussed other steps to support the transgender and gender nonconforming communities, including offering students medical insurance with transgender health benefits and building more gender-neutral restrooms on campus.


Freshman Karina Bercan believes the policy is a crucial step for colleges and society as a whole.


“I don’t feel that it is acceptable for anyone to have an opinion about someone else’s gender identity or expression and it’s hard for me to believe so many people can be so closed to change,” says Bercan. “It really is important that our culture moves towards inclusion of everyone, especially in terms of giving transgender students more opportunities in a supportive, safe atmosphere.”


Simmons will join two other U.S. colleges that recently announced policies welcoming transgender applicants. Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts and Mills College in Oakland, California. The latter announced in May a policy allowing transgender students to enroll, becoming the first women’s college in the country to do so.


Allison Fisher, a recent graduate from Mount Holyoke, says “institutions that recognize that self-realization and becoming are legitimate processes — and are willing to adapt their policies as changes evolve — are maintaining the initial intent of women’s colleges: to provide women a space to gain knowledge and be empowered.”


There are more than 40 women’s colleges nationwide, according to the 
, and some are being pushed to adopt similar policies.


At Smith College, an all-female private university in Northampton, Massachusetts, students have protested and launched online petitions in recent weeks, including a Facebook page, 
. 


In 2013, Smith College’s admission policy came under harsh scrutiny when a transgender applicant 
 to her Tumblr blog.


According to the 
, schools accepting transgender or gender nonconforming students do not jeopardize their federal funding. 


Women’s schools who adopt more open admissions policies may continue to turn away applicants who were born male and identify as male.


“As a women’s centered college, Simmons needed to take a stance on transgender applicants,” said Boucher. “I think that Simmons is standing on the right side of history. We as a society are moving forward, and this policy helps us be part of that move forward.”
