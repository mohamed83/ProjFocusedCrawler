Community colleges welcome Obama's challenge

's focus this week on training programs for laid-off workers reflects a long-standing view by his administration that community colleges are the linchpin of a transitioning workforce.

His State of the Union speech underscored one of the ironies about today's changing economy: Even with high unemployment, many jobs in good-paying fields such as data management and high-tech manufacturing go unfilled because employers can't find enough people with the training to do them.
To help close that gap, Obama wants to forge partnerships between community colleges and businesses. He said his goal is to train 2 million workers with skills that will lead them directly to a job.
"There really is a mismatch out there, and it's gotten worse during the recession," says Tony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, which studies the value of college in the labor market.
About 13.2 million Americans are unemployed, and 10 million more have taken part-time jobs or given up looking for full-time work, Carnevale's studies show.
About 3.2 million jobs are open, many of them requiring less than a bachelor's degree. Carnevale estimates 10% to 30% of those jobs are not being filled because people don't have the skills.
Obama cited a partnership between Siemens and Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte as a success. Siemens helped design a program offered by the school to train workers in lasers and robotics for a gas turbine factory it opened in Charlotte. It paid tuition for workers, including Jackie Bray, a single mom who had been laid off as a mechanic. Such partnerships are not new but need to be expanded, Obama said. 
Leaders of community colleges, which enroll nearly half of the nation's college students, welcome the challenge. But bruised by cuts in state funding, they hope Obama's budget, to be released next month, will provide details of how such programs will be financed.
"New initiatives are ready to go with the right funding," says 
, president of Ivy Tech Community College in Indiana. "We have terrific support from our local communities, but resources are limited."
 Some of the programs most in demand, such as nursing, health care and technology, are also the most expensive. 
Companies, too, must  invest in employees, says Tom Bowler, senior vice president at United Technologies, which makes jet engines, Otis elevators and other products. It has spent more than $1 billion on  training over the past 15 years, he says.
