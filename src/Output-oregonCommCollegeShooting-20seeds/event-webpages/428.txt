Tuition is just one of many college expenses. In order to award financial aid and scholarships, each school predicts its "cost of attendance
[
]
 " for a typical student attending for a full academic year. The COA is generally based on estimates of tuition and fees, books and supplies, room and board, transportation and personal expenses.


Typical costs:
For public 
 with two-year programs, tuition and fees can cost 
 $1,000-$12,000 
or more a year for state residents and 
 $4,000-$30,000 
or more for out-of-state students.
Full-time annual undergraduate tuition and fees at a four-year public college or university can cost 
 $4,000-$16,000 
or more for state residents and 
 $10,000-$35,000 
or more for out-of-state students, depending on the school, the location and the program of study. For example, 2013-2014 tuition and fees at public universities in Texas
[
]
 are 
 $4,446-$11,806 
for residents and 
 $9,714-$33,128 
for non-residents, with an average of 
 $7,625 
for residents and 
 $18,251 
for non-residents. For the Oregon University System
[
]
 2013-2014 tuition for state residents is 
 $6,856-$9,310 
and for out-of-state students it is 
 $15,720-$23,670
. At the University of Cincinnati
[
]
 , full-time annual undergraduate tuition is 
 $5,890-$10,784 
for Ohio residents and 
 $14,516-$25,816 
for out-of-state students.
The estimated COA for public colleges and universities can be 
 $10,000-$30,000 
or more for state residents and 
 $15,000-$55,000 
or more for out-of-state students, depending on the school, living arrangements and the local cost of living. For example, at Edison State College
[
]
 in southwest Florida, the COA is 
 $16,245 
for residents and 
 $28,864 
for out-of-state students. In Oklahoma public colleges and universities
[
]
 the average COA is 
 $11,163-$16,588 
for residents and 
 $17,916-$28,414 
for non-residents. The average undergraduate student budget in the Oregon University System
[
]
 is 
 $21,766 
for residents and 
 $35,888 
for out-of-state students.
At private four-year colleges and universities, annual undergraduate tuition and fees can cost 
 $25,000-$45,000 
or more. For example, undergraduate tuition and fees for the 2013-2014 school year are 
 $27,890 
at Wilmington College
[
]
 in Ohio; 
 $38,891 
Harvard
[
]
 ; 
 $44,000 
at Yale
[
]
 ; and 
 $42,690 
at Stanford
[
]
 .
The estimated COA for private colleges and universities can be 
 $50,000-$70,000 
or more. For example, the total estimated COA for undergraduate students for the 2013-2014 school year is 
 $60,460 
at Brown University
[

 $59,950-$65,150 
at Harvard
[
]

 $60,900 
at Yale
[
]
 ; and 
 $60,749 
at Stanford
[
]
 .
Many schools provide an online net price
[

 calculator, allowing students and their parents to enter basic information and get a rough estimate of the total amount they might be responsible for paying (through loans or savings) after typical grant and scholarship aid. For example, net price calculators are available for the City University of New York
[
]
 , the University of Michigan
[
]
 and Harvard
[
