Some of the firefighters who were at the scene of the shooting here in Roseburg have gathered at the Winchester Fire Station roughly a mile away as reporters wait for the Douglas County sheriff to hold a news conference. 


The firefighters were some of the first people on the scene. They said they had drilled for incidents like these, which helped the rapid response. Still, they were shaken.
