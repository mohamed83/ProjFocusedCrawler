Students get frugal about flying

When Sam Dolce flew home for summer vacation in June, he threw everything he needed in a large backpack and left everything else behind.


Dolce, a sophomore at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn. is just one of many college students who are trying to fly with as little as possible as airlines jack up fees for checking baggage. For college students who fly home frequently and live on tight budgets, the high fees mean that trips are planned further in advance, and students must be more frugal about what they bring with them to school.


For each of the five round trips he made home to Buffalo last year, Dolce bought his tickets on 
. While Dolce was able to find cheap airfare on the site, he had no control over the fees that airlines charged for checking baggage.


“Bag fees hamper going home,” Dolce said. “As a college student, it’s just not affordable.”


According to a Monday 
USA TODAY
 
, airlines are becoming increasingly reliant on bag fees to generate revenue and offset the rising cost of fuel. According to the article, U.S. airlines collected $1.38 billion in fees for checked baggage and changed reservations during the first three months of this year. The record high revenue is a $1.1 billion jump from the first quarter of 2007, when airlines introduced extra fees.


While airlines say that they depend on the strong source of revenue to maintain adequate service to customers, Jackie Resnick, a sophomore at Emory University in Atlanta, says that the fees have made planning trips home a headache.


When Resnick flew home from school last June, she arrived at the airport to find that her bags were over the weight limit. Resnick wound up paying $200 in fees to get her baggage home.


“It was horrible,” said Resnick, who flies Delta Airlines home to Los Angeles about three or four times a year. “Overweight fees are dumb,” she added.


According to a recent 
USA TODAY
 
, Delta charges an additional $90 for overweight checked bags weighing 51-70 pounds and $175 for oversized bags 63-80 inches on domestic flights. International travelers on other airlines fare even worse, with bag fees reaching $450 on some international flights.


In order to avoid bag fees, Dolce prioritizes what he wants to bring to and from school. This means leaving some of his clothes and his favorite vinyl record set at home when he goes away each semester.


“Even though you get financial aid for schooling, you can’t get it for travel,” Dolce said.
