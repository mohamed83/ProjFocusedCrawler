                                $10,530
                                And
                                $61,320

                                Feeling a little stressed about paying $61,320 to attend
                                Vassar College each year?

                                This number can be deceiving, and for many, the net price you pay will be less.
                            

                                While there is no tuition reduction for in-state students, 63% of freshmen
                                receive some form of financial aid, with the average amount totaling $38,451.

                                
                                    Students from low-income families receive an average of $50,790 in aid during their first year.

                        Total college costs include the estimated
                        cost of tuition, fees, books, supplies, room, board and other living expenses for freshmen living
                        on-campus.
                    

                                Projected Costs
                                
                                        Between $66,384 and $383,001
                                For a Four Year Degree.

                                
                                        Between $29,490 and $184,823
                                For a Two Year Degree.
                            

                                        Looking at the total projected cost for a college education over the course of two / four (or more) years can feel a little overwhelming.
                                        However, doing so will help better prepare you for the financial commitment you are making.
                                    

                                        The overall cost for on-campus students to attend Vassar College in
                                        2013-2014 was
                                        $61,320.

                                        To calculate future costs, we looked at the prior five years of data and determined that this cost

                                        increased an average of 3.6% each year.

                                        If this trend continues, we expect the full cost for incoming freshmen to be
                                        $65,751 during their first year.

                                        By their senior year, that cost will be approximately $73,005,
                                        for a bachelor degree candidate ($68,085 for an associate degree candidate)
                                        for a grand total of $277,343 over the course of four years
                                        ($133,836 over the course of two years).

                                        These numbers do 
not
 factor in financial aid, which reduces this overall cost by varying amounts per student.
                                    

                                Remember, the full costs quoted above are not what most students will pay, and the net price varies quite a bit based on individual circumstances.
                            
Net Price Decreasing

                                While the overall costs at this college have increased, the average net price for students receiving
                                financial aid has actually 
decreased
 over the past 5 years.

                        This table also highlights the impact student loans can have on the overall cost of college.

When can you expect to begin receiving bills from the college? Is there an option to make payments in monthly installments?

Will You Graduate On-Time Years?
20.1% of Vassar College students take more than
                            the expected time (two or four years) to graduate,
                            while 9.1% don't graduate at all.
                            This can inflate your costs if you are the former and reduce your ability to pay back loans if you are the latter.
                        
Cost of Compound Interest

                        Paying off a 10 year loan at 

                        interest is like paying for an extra year and a half of college.
