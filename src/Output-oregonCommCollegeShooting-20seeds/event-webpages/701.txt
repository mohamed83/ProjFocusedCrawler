IFC’s 
Portlandia
 is more than just a satire on Portland, Ore. and hipster culture. This show’s wisdom is hidden beneath the pokes at people who ask way too many questions about their chicken at a restaurant and bicycle riders who go too far to make their presence known. 


Well, 
, that is.


Here are five indirect lessons for grad students from 
Portlandia
.




By Chris Hornbecker, IFC


Carrie Brownstein and Fred Armisen — 
Portlandia
 Season 3.


1. Be careful where you buy your school books


As we saw in the 
 featuring Aubrey Plaza, it’s not always the best idea to venture far from your school’s bookstore or 
 source.


In the scene, a Portland college student is trying to buy books for class from an independent book store. But it’s met with lines like “we can order that for you … it’d take a year to get here,” “this class you’re taking, you don’t need it,” and “we’re about two seconds away from jumping up on this table and kicking everything in sight.” 


It even gets to the point where she spots one of the books she’s looking for, but the employee (played by the show’s star Fred Armisen in drag) claims she can’t reach it.


Be a bit selective about where you buy your grad school textbooks, because it could lead to problems (and/or laughter).


2. Just because you’re a starving student doesn’t mean dumpster diving’s for you


Yes, if you’re a grad student, you’re probably poor and starving. But this doesn’t mean you should resort to dumpster diving. At least not right away.


In the 
, you see some of the “realities” of dumpster diving: watermelon with a hair in it, baby sweaters that don’t fit no matter how hard you try, hard bread, vinegar mistaken for water, friends not wanting to have dinner with you, random people in the dumpster who criticize your lifestyle, etc.


Of course, some people can successfully dumpster dive but it’s not for most of us so don’t even try. Besides, who wants to use baby food as a sauce?


3. Arrogance about what you’re reading in class could lead to accidents


Look, I get the appeal of bragging about what you’re reading, especially if it’s to a cute person you’re trying to impress. But as we saw in the “
 sketch, it can lead to problems. Like you and your friend yelling back and forth about what you’ve read, racing across the street to grab a publication neither of you has read and getting hit by cars in the process.


The moral here is: If you brag about the cool, complex, beyond-the-average-mind books you’re reading in grad school, it could lead to an angry friend or, worse, getting hit by a car. 


Okay, so that’s a stretch, but seriously: No one likes a grad student who is just oh-so intellectual, so keep the bragging about how smart you are because of what you’ve read to yourself.


4. Everyone gets that you’re a broke student but casual loans aren’t a thing


Sure, you probably are below the poverty line, surviving on Ramen noodles and free lunches from friends who studied engineering during undergrad. But if you go to the bank asking for a loan to attend, say, your friend’s birthday party, like characters did in the “Portlandia” 
, you’ll probably get laughed at.


If you do find a bank like the one in 
Portlandia
 that has separate forms for adult birthday party loans and kid birthday party loans, you’ve struck gold and should never bank anywhere else. 


But finding loans to fund a sushi night out with fellow classmates or other things that the average American has money for probably won’t work out. The premise is funny, but the takeaway is serious: Don’t go into debt for fancy dinners and wild weekends while in grad school … or ever.


5. Don’t make a fictional video to get accepted into grad school


Even though the kid in this 
 was trying to get accepted into a pre-school, the same rule applies for grad school admissions: no clearly-false videos as a tactic to get in. Especially ones that interview your parents where they claim you taught them about literature as a baby and you’ve been a prodigy since birth.


Grad school 
 can see right through lies like that, no matter how good the production value is, how many times you quote Barack Obama in the video, or even if you have a really cool name like Grover. Unless you score Wes Anderson as the director. Yeah, that might sway them.


Of course, it’s unlikely that 
Portlandia
 ever tried to teach lessons about grad school or being a grad student. But you can find wisdom in anything, even satires about the city where young people go to retire.
