                        The Campus Safety and Security Data Analysis Cutting Tool is brought to you by the Office of Postsecondary Education of the U.S. Department of Education. This analysis cutting tool was designed to provide rapid customized reports for public inquiries relating to campus crime and fire data. The data are drawn from the OPE Campus Safety and Security Statistics website database to which crime statistics and fire statistics (as of the 2010 data collection) are submitted annually, via a web-based data collection, by all postsecondary institutions that receive Title IV funding (i.e., those that participate in federal student aid programs). This data collection is required by the 
Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act and the Higher Education Opportunity Act.





                         
                    





                        The crime statistics found on this website represent alleged criminal offenses reported to campus security authorities and/or local law enforcement agencies. Therefore, the data collected do not necessarily reflect prosecutions or convictions for crimes. Because some statistics are provided by non-police authorities, the data are not directly comparable to data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting System which only collects statistics from police authorities. 
                    



                        The fire statistics are reported only by institutions with an on-campus student housing facility or facilities, and the fire statistics are for those facilities only.
                    



                        The site contains a glossary that provides definitions for the various crime, fire, and geographic categories presented in the reports. Please note that valid comparisons of campus statistics are possible only with study and analysis of the conditions affecting each institution. 
                    



                        The OPE Campus Safety and Security Data Analysis Cutting Tool website is linked to the Department of Education's Federal Student Aid site, and
