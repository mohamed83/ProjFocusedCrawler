I think college students would agree that Robin Williams as John Keating in 
Dead Poets Society
 embodied the English teacher we all wish we had.


He leapt on desks. He encouraged his class to rip pages out of the textbook. He was defiant, comical, energetic and noisy. And his lessons were often taken outside of the classroom.


The character of John Keating, one of the roles Williams will be best remembered for, was a champion for possibility, for undiscovered greatness. Williams brilliantly portrayed Keating as an inspiring teacher who taught more than literature — he tried to change lives. As a result, any teacher who says he or she hasn’t dreamt of students standing upon their desks to appreciatively declare, “O Captain! My Captain,” is probably lying to you.


The lessons delivered by Williams in 
Dead Poets Society
 25 years ago seem all the more relevant today, perhaps especially to college students entering adulthood.


Inspired by four quotes from John Keating, here are a few things for college students to remember as they seek to make their lives extraordinary.


“I stand upon my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way.”


College is the perfect time to question what you think you know and to decide who you’re going to be for the rest of your life.


Like Williams says later in the film, “I always thought the idea of education was to learn to think for yourself.” While your best professors probably won’t encourage you to climb a desk like Robin Williams did, they will emphasize the need for you to be a creative thinker. Take them up on that challenge. It will serve you well your entire life, especially if you don’t always draw the same obvious conclusions as your peers.


The people that have the most extraordinary success don’t often approach things like everyone else. If you are going to accomplish your goals and see your dreams become reality, you are going to have to dare to be different. Embrace that perspective.


“There’s a time for daring and there’s a time for caution, and a wise man understands which is called for.”


Keating warns his students with these words after a practical joke, reminding them that it’s important to control themselves so they can continue their education. Remember you can’t always say “yes” to friends, dates, parties or extracurricular activities; you still won’t please everyone and you’ll probably flunk out of college. At the same time, you can’t say “no” all the time either, or you’ll miss out on life.


As you enjoy your time, make sure you have margin in your life so you don’t sacrifice your education. If you make wise decisions about what happens as you pursue your degree, you’ll almost always have room to add in some terrific experiences.


“No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world.”


The impact of words is an essential theme to the 1989 film as Keating opens his students’ minds to the world around them. As a college student, focus on what you think is fulfilling and important, what you want for your life and the world. Then share those things.


Get involved with student organizations like the college newspaper, the debate team or maybe student government. Never underestimate the potential for influence you have, especially on campus. Many people are passionate about something but have no idea how to make a difference or get where they want to end up. But you don’t really have to know. You just have to start communicating.


“Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.”


During the movie’s most iconic monologue, Keating’s students listen intently as he whispers the motto they will adopt: “Carpe diem.” Everyone wants to seize the day, but few people do. The patterns of college life combined with everyday distractions like Facebook or video games can weigh you down and hold you back. However, your college career will be over quickly.


So, don’t merely live in reaction. Be intentional with your time. Do more of the things you love and less of the things you like. Pursue the best opportunities. Fill your daily life with moments that are fresh, exciting and meaningful.


In a poignant scene in 
Dead Poets Society
, after quoting Whitman’s “O Me! O Life!” Robin Williams turns to the students and asks a striking question about life and legacy: “What will your verse be?”


Whatever your verse is, I hope it’s extraordinary.
