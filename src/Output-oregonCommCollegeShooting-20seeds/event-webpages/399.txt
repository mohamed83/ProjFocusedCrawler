College still worth the cost for students?

Although Meghan Rissky graduates from the University of Maryland in May, leaving the state won’t be an option for another four years.


Rissky receives a “scholarship” that pays for her tuition if she becomes a nurse in Maryland after graduation. If she doesn’t, she will owe UMD more than $100,000. And that’s on top of $50,000 in student loan debt she has yet to pay Texas Tech University for her first two undergraduate years.


“I plan on stopping after this degree,” Rissky says. “As far as payments go I’m just going to pay it off one month at a time … if I joined the military they’d forgive some of my payment. But if I did that, I would have to pay back to the state for nursing school so it wouldn’t really be worth it.”


Rissky’s situation isn’t uncommon according to a recent study by Junior Achievement USA and PricewaterhouseCoopers. More students are exploring alternatives to attending – and paying for – a traditional four-year university. The study revealed it is no longer guaranteed that students will continue their education past high school. What’s more, the increasing prevalence of college degree recipients, online courses and alternative schooling options make it difficult to determine the value of a college degree.


Viewpoint: 


“It’s almost a perfect storm,” says Junior Achievement CEO Jack Kosakowski. “These young people live through experiences of downsizing, people being let go, older siblings graduating without jobs then not ending up in their field … and they start to question if it’s worth it.”


Kosakowski says the rise in cost for traditional four-year universities causes students to question what is required to live a fruitful life, rather than simply assume higher education is the next step.


According to Junior Achievement and PwC’s survey, 32% of students between the ages of 13 and 17 believe they will attend their first choice university. But the study shows only 19% of students actually attend that top-choice school, with a record-high 57% of students last year electing to attend a school that wasn’t their first choice.


Financial aid is the critical factor for 60% of students when deciding which school to attend, with 62% not attending their top choice due to financial constraints.


“I think kids are being very practical,” Kosakowski says. “I think they’re starting to question what is required. There are opportunities for students without four-year degrees if they go to a community college. They’re starting to realize they can get the same experience without investing as much.”


Despite this shift in perception of the value of a college education,
 from Pew shows college graduates make an average of $17,500 more than high school graduates. This indicates a widening education pay gap as students increasingly seek alternatives to higher education.


Jamie MacMillan, president of the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation, a group that invests in improving learning in Idaho, says this trend is especially visible in rural areas .


“It’s a 1-2 punch,” MacMillan says. “It’s a combo of the fact our kids are poor and the cost of college tuition has doubled in the last 10 years. It’s almost nearly impossible for our kids to go on … I think many students in the last decade have rightfully questioned the value of the degree that they have.”


Rissky is among the many students nationwide who pay out of pocket for a college education due to insufficient financial aid packages. Despite having a 4.0 GPA, coming from a military family and initially pursuing an engineering degree, Rissky says she received no financial aid from Texas Tech University.


“My parents had it in my brain that I was going to college,” Rissky says. “I don’t think that I would have not gone to college, but maybe I would have waited a couple years. But it’s harder to get in if you do wait, so it’s a tough situation.”


Groups like J.A. and Kathryn Albertson say they are looking to make higher education more accessible, even if that means changing the traditional model. In the meantime, Kosakowski says students are increasingly exploring alternatives such as joining the military, attending community college or trade school and opting out of college entirely to avoid debt and enter the workforce immediately.




“When you look at stats on student debt and student loans, it’s frightening. We need to make kids aware of this big decision that’s one of the biggest investments of their life,” Kosakowski says. “Across the board folks are looking at other options, perhaps other ways to do things. The medical field, for example, with all the jobs that are opening up … technicians that make very good salaries, but require less education are a great value for young people.”


MacMillan says students are also learning the hard way that some schooling can be worse than no schooling at all. When students only make it through part of their education before dropping out for financial reasons, they are left with substantial debt and still no degree.


“The few that have been successful in obtaining a degree are faced with a mountain of debt and a low paying or no job at the end of their education,” MacMillan says. “I think questioning the quality of the degree is happening on the end of the pipeline.”
