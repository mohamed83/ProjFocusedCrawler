The rise of student entrepreneurs and start-up gurus like Evan Speigel of Snapchat have resulted in a Northwestern University idea incubator, which debuted this academic year.


The Garage, a 24-hour hub on the Evanston, Ill., campus, was established by the university Board of Trustee’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship Committee, and aims to bring students of all disciplines together to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.

“I want this to be a home for anybody who is interested in entrepreneurship or is starting a company and needs a space to work,” says Melissa Crounse, executive director of The Garage.


Crounse, an ex-Googler who spent 10 years in Silicon Valley, Calif., manages programming at the innovation lab. She also oversees a residency program, which allows select students 24-hour access to the space as well as mentorships with established entrepreneurs.

Crounse aims to “foster a culture of entrepreneurship” by also establishing an accelerator program for students who wish to learn how to formally market, research or pitch an idea. Along with programs, the new space includes areas for classes, meetings and prototyping. It also comprises two high-tech boards, a 3-D printer, privacy booths and an open kitchen.


“What I really want to create is the experience that I wish I had as an undergraduate,” Crounse says, “and to really foster a community that is collaborative and bringing like-minded people together to experiment in this space.”
