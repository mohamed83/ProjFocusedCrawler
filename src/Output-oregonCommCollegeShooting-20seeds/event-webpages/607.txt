College isn’t easy.


From classes to expectations of participation in campus clubs and organizations to part time jobs to the “classic” college social scene, time management can be a challenge for even the most organized students. Add in a family and the juggling act becomes one of Olympic proportions.


Ashley Woods, 27, is a full-time undergraduate student at Western Kentucky University (WKU) studying nursing. She’s taking 17 credits and works in the visual performing arts library at WKU. She’s also a mother of two — a five-year-old and a toddler.


They keep her hands full, she says. From making sure her daughter gets to kindergarten on time to making sure her son is cared for during the day to dinner and bath time at night, she’s constantly planning her college life around the lives of her two kids, which can be difficult.

She says she’s always worried she’s not spending enough time with her children, but reminds herself that pursuing her education is what is best for them in the long run, and hopes she’s setting a good example about the importance of education.


Fortunately, Woods says, she doesn’t have to go it alone and has a great support system in family members and her fiancé.


“I was a single parent for a while doing this, but I have so much family support,” Woods says. “Women who do it completely without any help, I don’t know how they do it. It literally takes the village that I have and I wouldn’t be able to do it without them.”


Nick Benson, 23, faces similar time management challenges balancing school, work and sharing custody of his two-year-old son.


“It really makes you have to grow up a little quicker and be more mature and think about situations and plan a lot more,” Benson says. “He’s the first priority.”

Benson says it would have been easy to stop going to school to care for his son, but instead he became more motivated than ever to graduate and provide a better life.


Benson is studying film with a minor in theater at WKU. He plans to graduate in December, but because he wants to keep his son near his mother, he won’t make any big moves yet.


“It’s just time consuming and it’s a balancing act but it works out,” Benson says. “I try to stay positive and not stress out too much. It’s just something you have to deal with and there’s ways to take care of it.”

Lauren Mcclain, assistant professor of sociology with expertise in family demography, says she doesn’t believe there’s a stigma associated with non-traditional students with children, but admits the different experience could influence student interaction and relationships simply due to different life experiences.


“You have a different perspective on life and what your education means to you (when you’re a parent),” Mcclain says.


While Woods says the challenges are obvious — time management and the constant worry she’s not spending enough time with her children — she doesn’t regret taking the non-traditional student route to get through school.


“I do sometimes feel like you miss out on some of that college experience,” Woods says. “No sorority is going to ask a 27-year-old mom of two to join.”


But Woods says she doesn’t believe she was mature enough at 18 to handle being a traditional college student. She believes her grades are better than they would have been at 18 and that she has a better idea of what she wants to do with her degree.


“I am glad I’ve made the choices that I did,” Woods says. “It’s crazy and it’s hectic, but they make you laugh and it’s worth it. At the end of the day, if it wasn’t for them I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing. It’s a different path — harder but more rewarding.”
