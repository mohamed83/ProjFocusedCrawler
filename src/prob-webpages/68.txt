Air India says those who didn't make the cut had failed on other parameters as well."This is a joke," said one of the rejected candidates on condition of anonymity. "Psychometric tests are dynamic in nature, are written and 3 hours long. It is not verbal. Also, elsewhere, if the candidates aren't up to the mark, they are counselled.""We got all our medical tests at places recommended by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. We can't be called medically unfit," said another.Air India has justified the new system, saying it is modelled on best global practices. Also, it incorporates systems developed by the IAF that go beyond brain mapping and check behavioural patterns, the airline said. It has denied claims that there were no verbal tests earlier.In a press statement, Air India said for the first time, an Indian Air Force psychologist was on the interview panel. Candidates were chosen based on marks scored in the simulator test as well as the interview.The DGCA says that psychometric tests are not mandatory for airlines, and they have developed their own yardstick but talks are on with all stakeholders to put new guidelines in place.RelatedApple Updates 15-Inch MacBook Pro With Force Touch Trackpad; Introduces Cheaper Retina 5K iMacColgate-Palmolive India Q4 Net Profit Rises 24% to Rs 164 CroreTeewe 2 Wireless HDMI Media Streaming Dongle Launched at Rs. 2,399Story First Published: May 19, 2015 21:42 IST        Exclusive: Glaring Errors in Judgement That Allowed Jayalalithaa to Get AwayRahul Gandhi Writes to Rajnath Singh Over Scrapped Food Park ProjectALSO READApple Updates 15-Inch MacBook Pro With Force Touch Trackpad; Introduces Cheaper Retina 5K iMacIndiaIndian Air ForcePilots' testGermanwings crashmental health for pilotsAir IndiaAir India recruitmentAir India testpilot's test................................
