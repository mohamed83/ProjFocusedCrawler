How Nepal can avoid the mistakes of Haiti, fighting violence against women in Brazil – and maternal healthcare









As a second earthquake hits Nepal we look at lessons learned from the Haiti quake, and a report from Brazil talks about challenging social norms on gender violence. We also invite you to submit your stories on childbirth

Nepal is grappling with the aftermath of a second earthquake, just weeks after the 7.8-magnitude quake that killed 8,000 people and destroyed homes and livelihoods. As aid was rushed to the country after the first quake, Haitian aid worker Prospery Raymond warned organisations not to repeat the mistakes made in response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Raymond called for acknowledgment of local NGOs, transparency of aid spending and a greater focus on the recovery process beyond the initial search and rescue efforts. 
Meanwhile, risk-management specialist Katie Peters emphasised the importance for Nepal to invest in “building back better” or risk more devastation in the future. You can also see some of the main appeals that have opened for Nepal quake survivors.

Opinion
While legislative changes in Brazil have paved the way for ending violence against women, more needs to be done on the community level to change social norms, argues Melanie Hargreaves from Christian Aid. Hargreaves says that funding for women’s rights organisations is vital in challenging the view that violence against women is normal. Meanwhile, Meena Bhandari proclaims the power of radio in South Sudan, where a local radio project is helping to calm community tensions. Bhandari says Nile FM plays a critical role in providing people with the fair and accurate information they need.

It is good to see and feel the thaw between both the countries through films, cartoons and other forms of arts and sports at a time when we face each other as enemies on the borders. Hope we could live like two separated brothers living in each one’s house!
