Recalling the Kargil conflict, Pakistan's former military dictator General Pervez Musharraf on Sunday said the Pakistani army "caught India by throat" and that India will never forget the war.
"There was a second line force, too, which caught India by throat and that was later given the status of army," Musharraf said, addressing a ceremony of his All Pakistan Muslim League (APML). Musharraf, who masterminded the 1999 Kargil conflict and ruled over Pakistan for nine years, said India will always "remember the battle of Kargil", the Geo News reported.
"We entered Kargil from four points of which India was not aware," the former President said, In May 1999, India and Pakistan, in their most serious military engagement since 1971, clashed in Kargil area of Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir after militants backed by Pakistani troops occupied the mountain peaks of Kargil. Speaking on the occasion, the former army chief also announced that his political party will take part in upcoming local bodies election in the country.
