(TOI Photo)RELATEDSonowal bats for Indo-Pak cricket series'We're open to discussion on other venues'Further talks needed, says BCCI secy'Ten Sports has nothing to do with rebel league''Have to consider sentiments of citizens'LUCKNOW: The decision on the India-Pakistan bilateral series is likely to be taken after June 15, BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur told TOI on Monday.  The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has proposed to hold the series in the neutral venue of Dubai, but before any final decision is taken some issues between BCCI and PCB need to be looked into, he added.  Thakur, who is also a BJP MP and national chief of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, said the BCCI is trying to sort out these issues with the PCB.  He added that after the BCCI nod, the Central government will take the final call on resuming cricketing ties with Pakistan.  On Sunday, Union sports minister Sarbananda Sonowal had said that "for better friendship and relationship, we want the series to take place".  Meanwhile, Thakur, who was in news after a leaked ICC letter alleged that he had been socialising with a bookie, said that the chapter was closed.  "I have given a befitting reply on the leaked letter," he said, adding that he was still waiting for the list of suspected persons with whom BCCI officials should not socialise.  The letter was allegedly leaked by the ICC's anti-corruption unit at the behest of ICC president N Srinivasan, who is at loggerheads with Anurag Thakur.
