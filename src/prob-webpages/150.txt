Aftershocks hinder rescue efforts as Nepal quake death toll passes 2,500









Dozens of aftershocks, including magnitude 6.7 temblor on Sunday, trigger more avalanches on Everest and cause panic across Nepal, as emergency supplies reach affected areas

A strong aftershock has caused panic and frustrated frantic efforts to reach possible survivors of Saturday’s earthquake in Nepal, with the death toll rising to more than 2,500.

As the government declared a state of emergency, officials said they expected the number of dead and injured to rise, while emergency supplies began to trickle in to affected areas.
More than 5,000 people were injured after the magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck late on Saturday morning. Local authorities said all but a few dozen of the deaths occurred in Nepal, and that at least 721 people had died in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu alone.
Dozens of aftershocks, including a powerful temblor on Sunday afternoon, have jolted Nepal over the weekend, forcing thousands of people to shelter where they can. On Sunday afternoon, climbers left stranded by initial avalanches on Everest were again in fear for their lives after a magnitude 6.7 aftershock triggered more avalanches. It also sent terrified residents running into the streets in Kathmandu.



The aftershock was the most powerful since the initial earthquake – itself the strongest since Nepal’s worst earthquake, in 1934, in which 8,500 people died.
An avalanche triggered by Saturday’s quake struck a section of Everest’s base camp, killing at least 17 people and injuring 61 others in the worst-ever disaster on the mountain. The bodies of the dead climbers were recovered on Sunday, while a plane carrying the first 15 injured climbers landed in Kathmandu at around noon local time.
Bhim Bahadur Khatri, 35, a cook and a Sherpa, was preparing food in a meal tent when the avalanche struck.
“We all rushed out to the open and the next moment a huge wall of snow just piled on me,” he told the Associated Press. “I managed to dig out of what could easily have been my grave. I wiggled and used my hands as claws to dig as much as I could. I was suffocating, I could not breathe. But I knew I had to survive.”

When he finally dug his way out, part of the base camp village was gone.
“I looked around and saw the tents all torn and crushed. Many people were injured,” he said. “I had lived but lost many of my friends.”
Further up the mountain, about 100 climbers were confirmed as safe, and some had been taken to base camp by helicopter. The situation of more people on other routes on the mountain was still unknown.
International efforts to get search and rescue teams on the ground while there is still a chance of retrieving people alive from the rubble were gaining momentum. Justine Greening, the international development secretary, announced a £5m relief package so that its partners and the British Red Cross can address immediate needs in Nepal.

The US pledged $1m (£659,000) to the aid effort and said it would send a disaster response team. India, Sri Lanka, Japan, China, Russia and the EU also announced they were providing help as as governments scrambled to locate their nationals.
Medical workers in Kathmandu worked round the clock to cope with the arrival of injured residents. Bodies were still arriving on Sunday at one hospital in Kathmandu, where police officer Sudan Shreshtha said his team had brought in 166 corpses overnight. “I am tired and exhausted, but I have to work and have the strength,” Shreshtha told Reuters as an ambulance brought three more victims to the Tribhuvan University teaching hospital.

Overwhelmed doctors moved hundreds of patients onto the streets of Kathmandu when aftershocks rattled buildings. Outside the National Trauma Centre, patients in wheelchairs who had been under treatment before the earthquake hit joined hundreds of injured with fractured and bloody limbs, who lay inside tents made from hospital sheets.
“We only have one operation theatre here. To be able to provide immediate treatment we require 15 theatres. I am just not able to cope,” said Dipendra Pandey, an orthopaedic surgeon, adding he had done 36 critical operations since Saturday.
Thousands of residents in Kathmandu and other areas spent an uncomfortable night sleeping in the open, too scared to return to homes that are vulnerable to strong aftershocks.

“We hardly slept through the night. It was cold and it rained briefly and it was uncomfortable but I am glad I brought my family out to the open,” said Kathmandu resident Ratna Singh, a vegetable vendor who was huddled under a blanket with his wife and son.
The full scale of the destruction was becoming apparent early on Sunday, as local and international rescue teams began the dangerous task of digging through the rubble of buildings to look for survivors.
Among the buildings destroyed was the Unesco-listed Dharahara tower. The 60m tower was built in 1832 for the queen of Nepal. All the earthquake left of the lighthouse-like building popular with tourists was a jagged stump 10 metres high.



Plumes of smoke rose above Kathmandu as friends, relatives and others gathered by the river to quickly cremate their loved ones’ remains. Many areas were without power and water on Sunday but when Kathmandu airport reopened the first planes loaded with aid arrived.
The UN said hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded and running out of emergency supplies and space to keep corpses. Aid workers warned that the situation could be far worse near the epicentre, which the US Geological Survey said was located near Lamjung, about 80km north-west of Kathmandu, in the Gorkha district.
World Vision said that remote mountain communities, including in Gorkha, had been unprepared for the violent shaking unleashed by Saturday’s quake.

Villages near the epicentre “are literally perched on the sides of large mountain faces and are made from simple stone and rock construction. Many of these villages are only accessible by 4WD and then foot, with some villages hours and even entire days’ walks away from main roads at the best of times,” the group’s local staff member, Matt Darvas, said in a statement.

Roads to Gorkha were blocked by landslides, hampering rescue efforts, but there had been no reports of fatalities in the Annapurna base camp area, a popular trekking destination. Relief efforts were being hampered by a collapse in communications, raising fears that a widespread humanitarian disaster was unravelling across the impoverished Himalayan nation of 28m.
“Our village has been almost wiped out,” said Vim Tamang, a resident of Manglung, near the epicentre. “Most of our houses are either buried by landslide or damaged by shaking.” He said that half the village’s population was missing or dead. “All the villagers have gathered in the open area. We don’t know what to do.”
