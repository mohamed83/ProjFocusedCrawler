After the Nepal earthquake, Warner Bros will evaluate the worldwide marketing campaign for its disaster film San Andreas, the studio said on Wednesday.
A Warner Bros representative, Paul McGuire, said the studio wants to ensure it is sensitive to people affected by the tragedy.
The powerful earthquake in Nepal on Saturday killed more than 5,000 people, injured twice that many and left tens of thousands of people homeless.
San Andreas imagines the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in California. Promos for the film to be released on 29 May show Los Angeles and San Francisco landmarks crumbling and wreckage flying at crowds.
In future promos, the studio will be including information on how to help the relief efforts in Nepal and also how to prepare for natural disasters.
Warner Bros had already planned public service announcements about preparedness around the marketing of the film, which stars Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino, but adjusted and accelerated those efforts after the quake in Nepal.
Universal Pictures has the film Everest set for release in September. The story is based on Jon Krakauer’s non-fiction novel Into Thin Air, about a tragic 1996 expedition. It follows a climbing group that is devastated by a severe storm.
With 19 people killed on Mount Everest in the recent earthquake, Universal will also consider changes to its promotion.
