Three RAF Chinook helicopters sent to help the Nepal earthquake relief effort are being recalled to Britain without flying a single mission after the Nepalese government turned down the chance to use them.
The twin-rotor aircraft were dispatched after the devastating earthquake, which killed more than 8,000 people and left thousands more in desperate need of aid. But the three helicopters, each capable of carrying up to 55 soldiers plus equipment, never left their base in Chandigarh, in India, because the government of Nepal decided it did not want to use them.
The Chinooks, along with 100 personnel, were deployed two weeks ago to help ferry supplies to isolated towns and villages which had been cut-off by the 7.8-magnitude quake. At the time, Justine Greening, the international development secretary, said: “These highly versatile Royal Air Force helicopters and UN aircraft will mean life-saving aid supplies can be moved around Nepal and reach people in remote communities cut off by the earthquake who are in desperate need.”
A government spokesman said on Friday that it was up to the Nepalese authorities to decide how to organise the humanitarian response. “We are disappointed that our Chinooks will not be supporting the World Food Programme’s request for help in distributing aid, but all decisions in relation to the relief effort are ultimately for the government of Nepal to take,” the spokesman said.
“The UK has been the biggest bilateral aid donor to Nepal in response to last month’s devastating earthquake, contributing over £23m, and we will continue to support the ongoing relief effort.”
Gurkha engineers from the British Army and a 60-strong search and rescue team have also been sent to Nepal from the UK, as well as more than 18 tonnes of shelter kits, lanterns and other essential supplies.
