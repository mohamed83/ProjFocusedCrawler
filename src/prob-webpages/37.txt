The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is likely to declare the Class 12 Board Results 2015 very soon. This year's examination was conducted in the month of March and over 11 lakh students appeared in the exams. 
Students were worried that the delay in decalring the results will cost them and they will be pressed for time while going for further admission processes in various other institutes. 
Central board of secondary education (CBSE), Delhi was established in 1962. There are various zones under CBSE board.

Delhi Zone
Ajmer Zone
Chennai Zone
Allahabad Zone 
Guwahati Zone
Panchkula 
Patna
Bhubaneswar,
West Bengal,
Orissa,
Chhattisgarh 

These exams are conducted in the month of March and April and results of all regions are announced on the same day.
Once announced, students can check their results on http://cbse.nic.in/ and http://cbseresults.nic.in/ .
Students will need to provide their seat number to get the results on these websites. These results will not be treated as mark sheets. Board will issue the originals and students can collect them from their respective schools.  
A candidate has to pass in five main subjects as per Scheme of Studies to be declared Pass in this exam. 
We would like to wish all the candidates all the best for future.
