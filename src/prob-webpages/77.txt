Nepal's prime minister has reportedly appealed for two billion dollars in donations to rebuild his country, devastated by two massive earthquakes in three weeks, which have killed thousands and shattered the impoverished nation's infrastructure.
	Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, whose regime has faced flak in the past over the speed of its response to the quakes, said on Sunday that the administration had set up a national rehabilitation and reconstruction fund, and asked donors to help, reported News24.
	He added that his government had earmarked 200 million dollars as seed money for the fund but urged donors, communities and private sector to make necessary contribution.
	Koirala also said that rehabilitation and reconstruction was very important for them and hoped, "our friends will come with a large heart to assist."
	A massive 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit the Himalayan nation on April 25 and was the deadliest quake to hit the country in more than eight decades. It killed more than 8,500 people and destroyed half a million homes.
	It was also followed by a second massive tremor that triggered landslides and shattered houses, triggering fresh misery amid people still traumatized by the previous earthquake.
	Over 20 nations have pitched in by sending rescuers to help search for survivors and aid in relief efforts since the first quake struck.
