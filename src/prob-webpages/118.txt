 an opportunity for the world. It will also give India the capacity to do more for our world,” he told the gathering of Asian leaders.
Modi said Asia will succeed more when all of Asia rises together. “It must not be a continent of nations on the rise and others in decline; of regions with stability and others with broken institutions.”
He said youth should be empowered with skills and education so that they can look to the future with hope.
“Over the next 40 years, three billion Asians will lift themselves into a higher level of prosperity. Asia’s prosperity and rising population will place a huge demand on our limited resources,” he said, adding that our footprint on earth must become lighter as our economic weight increases.
Stating that combating climate change is in Asia’s enlightened self-interest, he said India has set a goal of 175 Giga Watts of new renewable energy capacity over the next five years. “But, coal and oil will remain the key source of energy for all of us for a long time to come,” he said.
“We must connect our regions through infrastructure and integrate them through trade and investments. We must also do everything possible to secure lasting peace and stability for Asia. We must build institutions that promote cooperation on the principles of equality, co-existence and international rules and norms,” the Prime Minister said.
“It is also our collective task against our common challenges –terrorism; trans-national crimes; natural disasters and diseases,” he added.
