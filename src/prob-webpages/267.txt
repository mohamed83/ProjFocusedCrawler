Scathing criticism against him in the CPM state conference on Saturday prompted him to think about quitting.​Veteran CPM leader VS Achuthanandan left Alappuzha, boycotting the ongoing CPM state conference, by 4 a.m. this morning in protest against the failure of central leadership to address his woes. VS reached his official residence in Thiruvananthapuram by 6 a.m.Opposition leader V S Achuthanandan has sought the urgent intervention of the Centre to save the Sree Chitra Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology. In a letter written to union science and technology minister Harsh Vardhan, the opposition leader has said that the director post of this prestigious institute is lying vacant for the past 18 months and no step has been taken till now to appoint a new director here.Bar bribery row has triggered an unrest within the CPM with the party state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan pooh-poohed the demand of opposition leader V S Achuthanandan to have a CBI inquiry into the bribery charges. The party has a firm stand on the investigation into the issue which the party will declare. The CBI is an agency which has received severe criticism, said Pinarayi Vijayan while speaking at a party function here on Sunday evening.Due to delay in finalizing the name of ruling party leader, mayor Pravin Datke continues to hold the post. Differences between union minister Nitin Gadkari and BJP state president Devendra Fadnavis have led to a delay in announcing the name.

Apply now to volunteer with Teach India at www.teachindia.net for Delhi/NCR & Mumbai region only.The BJP government has insulted and neglected the state through the budget. There is no proposal to help the crisis ridden traditional sectors of the state and even for the PSUs no funds have been allocated. There is not even a mention about Vizhinjam port which is a matter of concern, said V S Achuthanandan, opposition leader.Opposition leader V S Achuthanandan has sought the removal of chief secretary Bharat Bhushan and order a probe into the wealth amassed by him in the wake of Thrissur Vigilance Court registering cases against his wife.``This has proved that the chief secretary has kept secret the details of his wealth. When I levelled this allegation both in the Assembly and outside, the chief minister had tried to protect him. He had even tried to justify the chief secretary,'' he said.Opposition leader V S Achuthanandan has alleged that the chief minister Oommen Chandy is giving silent support to the attempt of a private builder to grab the government land at the heart of the city. Achuthanandan who visited the land in Pattoor where the said private builder has encroached the government land urged the chief minister to immediately intervene in the issue and cancel the order given by revenue principal secretary urging to shift the sewage line to benefit the private builder.Opposition leader V S Achuthanandan has levelled a series of corruption allegations against chief secretary Bharat Bhushan. He alleged that the chief secretary has amassed illegal wealth and he had kept this as secret while declaring his assets.Opposition leader V S Achuthanandan has urged the government to withdraw from the decision to withdraw the ambulances. The government move to introduce a very basic model of ambulances will only help the private players. If the present 108 ambulances are introduced in all district, then it will affect the business of private ambulances. Hence the move to extend the service of the 108 ambulances have been sabotaged with vested interests, he alleged.     The SP also denied the allegation that the police was forcing Vishwas's wife and sisters to leave Amethi stating, "We have information that there are around 40-50 persons inside his house and I am sure not everyone is a family member. We have asked for a list of immediate family member from Kumar Vishwas and those in the list will not be touched.""There is no harassment of any kind. We are simply following the orders of the EC as per which  people other than voters should be sent out of the district so as to ensure free and fair elections," he said. "The drive is being carried out across the constituency," SP claimed.Superintendent of Police, Amethi, Hira Lal rubbished all allegations levelled by AAP leaders against the police and district administration.Accusing police and district administration of taking one-sided action to help Congress rig the elections, Vishwas alleged that more than 15 incidents of attacks on AAP volunteers have taken place in the past four days but police has not taken any action despite written complaints naming attackers.AAP-police confrontation continues.About usPrivacy policyNewsletterSitemapCreate Your Own AdAdvertise with usFeedbackTOI MobileTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal PolicyRSSePaperArchivesOther Times Group news sitesThe Economic Times | इकनॉमिक टाइम्स | ઈકોનોમિક ટાઈમ્સ | Pune Mirror | Bangalore Mirror | Ahmedabad Mirror | ItsMyAscent | Education Times | Brand Capital | Mumbai Mirror | Times Now | Indiatimes | नवभारत टाइम्स | महाराष्ट्र टाइम्स | ವಿಜಯ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ | Go Green | Lifehacker India | Gizmodo India | Eisamay | IGN India | NavGujarat SamayLiving and entertainmentTimescity | iDiva | Entertainment | Zoom | Healthmeup | Luxpresso | Gadget Reviews | Guylife | Online Songs | MensXP.com | Hotels | Travel Destinations | Cricbuzz.comInterest NetworkitimesHot on the WebWorld | Politics | Business | Sports | Entertainment | Science & Tech | New Cars | Real Estate | India Budget 2015ServicesBook print ads | Online shopping | Free SMS | Website design | CRM | Tenders | Matrimonial | Ringtones | Astrology | Jobs | Tech Community | Property | Buy car | Bikes in India | Deals | Free Classifieds | Send money to India | Used Cars | Restaurants in Delhi | Movie Show Timings in Mumbai | Remit to India | Buy Mobiles | Listen Songs | News | TimesMobile | Real Estate Developers | Restaurant Deals in DelhiTrending TopicsWatch TV Shows | Photogallery | You Tube | Delhi Travel Guide | Katrina Kaif
