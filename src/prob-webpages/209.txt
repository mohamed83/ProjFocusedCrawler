Summary

We’re going to bring the blog to close for now. Here’s a summary of the latest developments:

A 15-year-old boy has been rescued from the rubble in Kathmandu after surviving for five days on jars of ghee. Pemba Lama was prised from the debris using a car jack. He was later photographed sitting up in bed eating tinned pineapple. 
Hopes are dimming of finding more survivors after the body of another teenager was found near Pemba. He told rescuers he had been in communication with two others buried in the same debris before losing contact this morning.
The UN’s humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos, has arrived in Nepal to give her support to relief effort. Amos is due to spend three days in Nepal to assess the relief operation and highlight the plight of survivors. 
The death toll from Saturday’s earthquake has reached 5,844, according to figures from the ministry for home affairs. It said a further 11,538 people were injured .
Heavy rain and aftershocks have added to the difficulty of getting aid to remote areas in Nepal, the Guardian’s Jason Burke reported after travelling to within 10 miles of the epicentre of the earthquake in Gorkha district. He said the main priority now was to help hundreds of thousands of people forced to sleep rough with little or no means of survival.
The first British government flight back from Nepal has arrived in London, bringing 120 Britons home to emotional reunions with family and friends. Among those on board were children, older people and those chosen as a priority because of health conditions.
The UN has launched a $415m (£270m) urgent appeal to help estimated 8 million people affected by the earthquake over the next three months. An estimate 2.8 million people have been displaced by the earthquake, it said.

The first British government flight back from earthquake-hit Nepal arrived this morning bringing 120 Britons home to emotional reunions with family and friends.
Here’s video of their arrival.

Britons returning from Nepal after the earthquake that has killed thousands arrive at Stansted airport to be reunited with their loved ones. One survivor says it is a relief to be back, but adds that it is impossible to be happy knowing the number of people who were killed. The death toll in the country believed to be close to 5,500 and rescue efforts are increasingly hampered by poor weather conditions

The Guardian’s Jason Burke has urged NGOs to try to reach some of the remote villages he reported from over the last three days after returning from close to the epicentre of the quake.

Any NGOs etc I have contacts for health worker in swarakoth, in sindhulpalchok. Be good to get aid in there. Jason.burke@theguardian.com



He pointed out that the Swarathok, where all 71 homes were destroyed, had no aid deliveries.
“No one has come. I walked to the police post and told them we were here. They said there was no plan and they had no orders and told us to stay where we are and wait. So we are waiting,” health worker Rashmita Shashtra told Jason on Tuesday.

 10.17pm AEST08:17 

The manager of an orphanage in Bhaktapur, east of Kathmandu, says 40% of the city being destroyed but only one international organisations has come to help. 
Writing for the Guardian’s Global development network Ramesh Prahananga says thre is mounting anger at the lack of help.


There are big organisations like Unicef, UNDP, and other international NGOs in Nepal, but still none have come to Bhaktapur. The people are very angry. It’s been five days and no one has come to us. One international NGO came with around 100 tents but the people needed around 10,000. They were so angry, violence was about to break out.

The number of people sleeping rough has decreased but tens of thousands of people still face a sixth night camping in the open, writes Ishwar Rauniyar.
They include Rajendra Mahato, a 26-year-old carpenter from India and his family who are camping out in Kathmandu’s Tudilkhel army parade ground.
He has been left homeless and jobless with nothing to help support his children and pregnant wife. The family’s rented flat was completely destroyed in the disaster. 
“We only survived because we had gone to the cinema when the earthquake hit” he said. 
The family has had no proper food and is living under a leaky tent. Gesturing to his wife Mahato said: “She is feeling uneasy living in such place, and these two toddlers they are not getting proper food and water.” One of his children has a fever. 
Mahato added: “The Indian government has arranged a vehicle for us, but how can I go? All the belongings, money etc. are buried in the house.”

Relatives of those feared buried in the rubble with Pemba Lama are losing hope of finding their loved ones alive, writes Ishwar Rauniar in Kathmandu.
Kumar Khadka, 21, was waiting anxiously outside the collapsed building at New Bus Park, praying for “good news” of his wife and six-month-old daughter. 
“My daughter and wife is buried under this guest house. I have lost my hope that they would be alive,” he said. 
Kumar, who works as a driver, said: “My wife had come to visit me from home in Kavre district. After taking a tour of city I asked her to take lunch at the guest house while I drove on a job.” 
“An hour later Kathmandu was hit by an earthquake, and took away my happiness,” he said.

 8.29pm AEST06:29 

AFP has confirmed that another teenager’s body has been pulled from the same ruins where Pemba Lama was rescued. Hopes appear to be dimming of finding any more survivors from the spot after Pemba had told his rescuers he had been speaking to other survivors this morning. AFP has more on the rescue:


Libby Weiss, a spokeswoman at the Israeli military-run hospital where Pemba was taken said: “He was under the rubble for 120 hours and it is certainly the longest we have heard anybody of being under the rubble and surviving.
“We understand he didn’t have any food and just two jars of ghee (clarified butter), which he had at the time he was under the rubble. 
“He was triaged but, remarkably, speaking with us, fully conscious and was able to communicate and doesn’t have any major injuries or wounds. He is doing remarkably well.” 
“The area was very narrow. We used our tools and dug him out. We asked ‘Is anyone inside?’ and we heard a ‘dhuk dhuk’ sound and kept searching,” L.B. Basnet, one of the Nepalese rescuers, told local television.
“He was behind a bike, we had to cut through it. And we pulled him out successfully. This was very good, very good.” 
Joy at Pemba’s rescue however was tempered when the body of another teenager was found close to his. 
“He (Pemba) told us he had been speaking to two other people until early this morning but after that he could no longer hear them,” said Narayan Thapa, an APF inspector.

A group of American rescuers together with Nepalese police and army personnel are trying to locate more survivors from the rubble of the building that buried survivor Pemba Lama, Ishwar Rauniyar reports from the scene. 
Everyone is quiet, trying to hear any sound of the survivors. Three sniffer dogs are trying to pick up the scent of those trapped. 
Pemba, who had been working at the guest house when it collapsed said, told rescuers he had been in conversation with two other survivors until 4am on Thursday morning. 
Hundreds of people have gathered in the street hoping to see another successful rescue.

Heavy rain and aftershocks have added to the difficulty of getting aid to remote areas in Nepal, Jason Burke reports after travelling to within 10 miles of the epicentre of the earthquake in Gorkha district. 
In a phone update from Nepal, he said the aid operation is “slow moving” because it so difficult to travel just a few miles on the roads. “The weather has been a real factor in slowing things down,” he said and recalled reaching one village by walking for an hour after the 4x4 vehicle he was travelling in was blocked by mudslides. 
Tensions are beginning to rise, Jason confirmed. “There is a lot of frustration at the government ... There is increasing anger they feel abandoned by the government and are taking the matter into their own hands.” Local businessmen are donating rice, while others are trekking to Kathmandu for food, he reported. 
Jason said the main priority now was to help hundreds of thousands of people forced to sleep rough with little or no means of survival. Many people are trying to camp out with nothing “not even a spoon, not even a bucket” he pointed out. 


It is that basic, those people need basic survival equipment – a tarpaulin, a blanket, a foam mattress, a bag of rice, some kind of cooking utensils, a means of lighting fires, and they need medicine.

Rescuers try to save boy

Rescuers in Kathmandu are trying to reach a 15-year-old boy buried under the rubble and apparently still alive five days after the earthquake.
USAID team leader Andrew Olvera says: “We have lights, we have generators, we have heavy breaching equipment, jackhammers, and we’re trying to get him out.”
He says the boy is not too far down, but the floors have collapsed and “he’s pancaked between them.”
 The team has dropped medical supplies and IV fluid to team members who went down inside, including a U.S. firefighter medic who is part of the team. It’s unclear if the boy was able to receive them, AP reports. 
 The team also stuck a rotatable camera on a pole into the hole to see how best to get him out. Olvera says it looks like it used to be a seven-story building with concrete slabs hanging down.

Hopes had been fading of finding any more survivors. On Wednesday the Nepalese authorities turned away international offers of dispatching more search and rescue teams.
There are at 37 teams on the ground with more than 500 rescuers and their sniffer dogs. 
The UN’s  $415m (£270m) urgent appeal launched on Wednesday pointed out that only 14 people were known to have been rescued from beneath the rubble at the time its assessment was drawn up.

AFP also has an update on the situation at Mount Everest. Remarkably the tourism minister for Nepal has declared that climbing will continue from next week despite the earthquake. Here’s some of that report:

Saturday’s avalanche that ripped through base camp also destroyed ladders through the treacherous Khumbu icefall higher up the mountain, raising doubts about the future of this year’s climbing season.
But tourism department chief Tulsi Gautam advised climbers against abandoning their expeditions, saying repairs were under way.
“The ladders will be repaired in the next two to three days and climbing will continue, there is no reason for anyone to quit their expedition,” Gautam told AFP.
Some 800 climbers were on the mountain when the avalanche roared through base camp, leaving 18 people dead and scores injured.
The avalanche was triggered by a massive earthquake that has devastated Nepal and left more than 5,500 people dead.
Emergency teams using helicopters evacuated the most seriously injured from base camp, while scores trapped higher up Everest were also rescued.
But Gautam said the government has this week held talks with mountaineers and guides who said they were keen to resume climbing.
“There is no scientific reason to expect another quake... and we feel the ground is stable enough for climbing despite aftershocks,” he said.

Reuters has just filed its latest story from the capital. It makes for grim reading with the weather now adding to the problems that rescue and relief workers are facing.

While rescue teams were out in the capital Kathmandu despite the rain, helicopters could not fly to the worst-hit areas in the countryside of the impoverished Himalayan nation. 
“There may not be any more survivors,” said Rameshwor Dandal, chief of the disaster management centre at Nepal’s home ministry. 
“The rain is adding to the problems. Nature seems to be against us.”

Ishwar Rauniyar adds to his previous reporting from Kathmandu:

The city today is little calm and with less movement of people even as thousands are still leaving Kathmandu valley.
“It’s been five days since we have been living in open space, in Bhaktapur, but no one came to help us so I am planning to go back to my home in Sunsari district in the eastern Nepal,” said Rajendra Yadav,39, who was getting bus ticket.
“I along with my wife and three children are leaving today.”
Sukhimaya Magar, 46, a vegetable seller, said: “We are finding difficulty leading our daily lives, everything we had is buried inside the house.” 
A single mother Magar added: “I cannot even go to my village, as there is no one there.”
Sudarshan Satyal, 36, from Kavre district had come to Kathmandu looking for support as relief had not yet reached his village.
 “Everyone at my village near Panchkhal is living under the open space with less access to water and food,” he said. “I came here for support but am returning empty hand. I couldn’t even buy any tents as they seem not available in the market.”
Sambhu Dahal, President of Purwanchal University College Association of Nepal, who is voluntarily managing the buses said:
“There was a chaotic situation yesterday, as we lacked proper coordination, but things are alright today.”
According to him more than 100 “free of cost buses” provided by the government have already left this morning.
“We have more 200 buses in the loop that will leave today to various parts of the country,” he said. “We distributed 5000 coupons yesterday, from tomorrow we do not have any free vehicles.”

 2.07pm AEST00:07 

AFP reports that a group of trekkers has been rescued from the Gorkha valley after they built a 3-metre “help” sign to attract attention:

As the helicopter swooped over Nepal’s lush Gorkha Valley in search of earthquake survivors, the 10-foot ‘HELP!’ sign spelled out by a desperate group of foreign trekkers couldn’t fail to grab the pilot’s attention.
“Thank God you’ve come!” said 31-year-old Julia Strelcoua after the Indian military helicopter landed in a clearing and then whisked her and fellow trekkers to safety in the adventure sports hub of Pokhara.
Strelcoua was part of a group of around a dozen mainly Slovakian trekkers who were enjoying the stunning views of central Nepal’s tranquil Gorkha district when a 7.8-magnitude quake tore through the ground on Saturday.
While they were uninjured, many nearby villages were devastated, with their flimsy brick huts and wooden shacks unable to withstand the impact of the tremors.
“Rocks and rubble tumbled down, it was the most horrifying experience,” Strelcoua told AFP. “We walked around looking for help and we found villages completely destroyed, dead people laying around.
“The sight of dead animals … they were just rotting, the smell, I can’t even describe,” added Strelcoua.
Unnerved by the aftershocks and with communications down, the group decided to stay put rather than try to carry on with the planned trek for fear that their path would be blocked by rockfalls or landslides.
“Four days we were just stuck. No signal, no communication,” said Strelcoua.
“We didn’t know if anybody would find us. What if we were stuck there for weeks or months? It was so scary. I can’t begin to tell you how I feel right now.”

Lydia Ko.


New Zealand golfer Lydia Ko has pledged to donate all her prize money from this week’s LPGA tournament to the relief effort in Nepal.
The total purse this week is $A1.62m, with the winner to receive $A243,400.
World number one Ko told journalists ahead of the North Texas Shootout that she wanted to help victims, saying the disaster had had an impact on her:


We had a big one in New Zealand, too, a couple years ago [in Christchurch], and it affected a lot of people.
Natural disasters you can’t do much about. Sometimes it’s hard to be prepared for it, so I thought, those people there, nice people and very innocent, I wanted to give this tournament’s earnings and donate it to them.

'No one has come to help us'

Ishwar Rauniyar, who is working for the Guardian in Nepal, reports that many people are still awaiting aid:

At a time when the government is saying they have sent relief packages to almost every parts of affected area, this morning I received a call from Swarathok in the remote district of Sindhupalchowk, which has been left devastated by the earthquake, saying “no aid agencies or government has appeared to help them”.
Rasmita Shrestha said: “No one has come to help us. There is not even a single house standing out of 71 houses in the village.”
She added: “We are in dire need of support: there is no water, no food, no shelter and even the dead animals are smelling badly. The local police is not coordinating us.”
It is the same story in Badal Gaon in Kavre district, where Shiva Hari Khatri says: “We are left nowhere, how can we get the support?
“Millions of aid is coming to Nepal but we don’t have a tent to hide our heads.”

Around 120 British nationals who were in Nepal when the earthquake struck have just arrived back at London’s Stansted airport on a UK aid flight that had delivered relief supplies to Kathmandu.

Up to 200 other British nationals remain in the British embassy in Kathmandu.
On Wednesday evening, Philip Hammond, the UK foreign secretary, confirmed that one British dual national, a resident of Hong Kong, had died in the disaster.
More than a dozen Britons remain trapped in the Langtang valley, a popular trekking spot north of Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital, according to some who have been able to get in touch with their families. But relatives say the FCO has done nothing to help them.
Hammond said:


We know that this is an agonising time for those who are waiting for news of loved ones. But the scale of the disaster and the limited communications means that it may be some time before we can account for everyone.
Many are likely to be in a place of safety but not able to communicate easily.

 12.16pm AEST22:16 

The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that it will take time for food and other supplies to reach more remote communities that have been cut off by landslides.
The programme’s Geoff Pinnock, who is coordinating aid flights, said:


More helicopters, more personnel and certainly more relief supplies, including medical teams, shelter, tents, water and sanitation and food, are obviously needed.


He said the relief effort would need to continue for months.
The WFP says it is concentrating its efforts on priority areas outside Kathmandu, including Gorkha, Lamjung, Sindhupalchowk, Rasuwa, Nuwakot, Dhading, Dolakha, Ramechhapp, Kavre, Bhakapur and Lalitpur.

 12.04pm AEST22:04 
Why is aid moving so slowly?

Part of the problem is the sheer scale of devastation: more than 8 million people have been affected by the earthquake and its aftermath, with the UN estimating that 1.4 million people are currently in need of food assistance.
As Jason Burke reports, transporting the aid to those who need it is also a major hurdle:


A series of bottlenecks is slowing the entry of aid into the country. Nepal’s sole international airport, in Kathmandu, is massively congested. Though some major NGOs had stockpiles of basic non-perishable items in Nepal before the quake, the poor country’s inadequate road system has posed huge problems even in areas that emerged relatively unscathed from the quake.
The problems were made even worse on Wednesday by a mass exodus from Kathmandu. Tens of thousands crowded on to buses to leave the city, driven by the prospect of further earthquakes, epidemics and a breakdown in law and order.
By 8am, more than 300 packed buses and coaches had passed the checkpoint on the main western highway out of the city, officials stationed there said, nearly 10 times the usual number.
Most were heading for distant regions where the family homes of many Kathmandu residents were located. One official said the total number of those leaving the city since Tuesday could reach 300,000, more than a tenth of the city’s total population. “They keep coming, I’ve never seen it like this,” said sub-inspector Tara Bhattrai, in charge of the Thankot checkpoint. “They are going to all destinations.”
Supplies are running thin and aftershocks have strained nerves in the city. Many of those travelling appeared in a state of near panic.

 11.42am AEST21:42 

Associated Press reports that China has closed all climbing on its side of Mount Everest for the rest of the spring:

Hundreds of climbers and Sherpas who were attempting to climb Mount Everest from the north side when the earthquake struck the region are packing their gear and heading out after expedition leaders said Chinese authorities had closed all climbing in Tibet for the spring.
Meanwhile, some climbers in Nepal have announced plans to try to return to the mountain, a move that was criticised by others in the climbing community.
In Tibet, climbing guide Adrian Ballinger, with California-based Alpenglow Expeditions, said on Wednesday that they were working to leave the country soon.
“We are focusing our efforts on how we can help in Nepal, how we can get our members home, and how we can get our Sherpa team back to the Khumbu,” said Ballinger, who was leading a team of 10 climbers and 12 Sherpas.
No one climbing on the north side was injured following Saturday’s deadly quake, but Ballinger said the China Tibet Mountaineering Association called back the 25 teams, made up of about 300 climbers, to base camp to discuss whether to allow them to continue.


On Wednesday, Chinese officials held their final meeting and announced their decision to end the climbing season. Ballinger said two reasons were cited: safety concerns over possible additional earthquakes and solidarity with Nepal and the Sherpas. “China believes Sherpas should be able to go home and begin rebuilding,” he said.

Nineteen people were killed in the base camp on the Nepal side of the mountain when a quake-triggered avalanche swept through.
In Nepal, some climbers have received permission to try again for the summit. Russell Brice, leading a team for the London-based Himalayan Experience Limited, posted a blog saying they are considering a return to Everest. “Our Himex team will stay at Everest BC for the next few days and we will then decide if we will continue or not,” he said.
Brice said he met with the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the Minister of the Ministry of Tourism on Wednesday and received permission to fly loads to Camp 1 after helicopters were free from rescue operations.
Longtime mountain guide Peter Athans of Washington state, who has summited Everest seven times, called the idea disrespectful. “Ethically, it’s neither climbing the route and neither is it very respectful to the suffering of the Nepalese who need heli support immediately,” Athans said. “The climbers would be diverting this critical resource at a dire moment in the crisis.”
Ballinger also said the resources should be used on earthquake victims: “My thought is expedition teams on the ground in Nepal guides, doctors, Sherpas could be using their skills and strength for far better purposes.”

Opening summary

Five days after the devastating 7.9 magnitude earthquake that struck Nepal, killing more than 5,000 people and injuring at least 100,000, many survivors – particularly those in more remote areas – have still yet to receive emergency aid.
Despite stories of incredible survival – a four-month-old baby pulled from the rubble of his family house in the town of Bhaktapur; a man rescued after being trapped for 82 hours – hopes are fading that more people will be found alive amid the ruins.

Anger erupted in Kathmandu on Wednesday over what many see as the slow pace of relief efforts to the stricken country. Protesters blocked traffic, with one saying:


We are hungry, we haven’t had anything to drink. We haven’t been able to sleep.
I have a seven-year-old child who is sleeping in the open. It’s getting cold and people are getting pneumonia.


Thousands of people attempted to flee the capital as supplies ran low.
But conditions in many places beyond the city are also dire. The Guardian’s Jason Burke, who has travelled to the remote Gorkha district near the border with Tibet, reports:


 Officials and relief workers are desperately seeking information on about 10,000 people living in the northernmost areas of Gorkha district, where the epicentre of Saturday’s earthquake was located.
Nothing is known of the condition of villagers in these remote and mountainous areas near the frontier with Tibet, but up to 90% of buildings in nearby areas a similar distance from the epicentre have been destroyed or rendered uninhabitable.


The UN has launched a $415m appeal to help the estimated 8 million people affected by the earthquake.
This live blog will have updates throughout the day as aid and rescue efforts continue.
