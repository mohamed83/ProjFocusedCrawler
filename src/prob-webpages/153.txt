Our main concern for animals in the aftermath of this quake is for livestock. The worst effect of this disaster has been on cows and goats in remote locations that have lost their shelters and been exposed to the elements for days, which has made many of them very sick.

People don’t have time to put their animals out to graze because they are rebuilding their houses or trying to find food for the next meal. So these animals have been permanently tied up to keep them safe. They are extremely stressed because of the sudden restrictions on their movements, and when stress levels increase in livestock their immunity goes down. We’re seeing evidence of infectious diseases. The disaster for these animals is not over. It’s just starting. These are the critical two weeks when they have to be given veterinary care because having survived the earthquake is not enough. They have to survive this difficult time.
One difficulty is that these villages are so remote. It takes hours to drive from to one to the next. There’s thousands of villages out there and how do we get to them all? We’ve started working with the district livestock services, giving them supplies so they can distribute to remote places.
In several of the villages we visited people are camping out without any tents and if they have a tarp the first thing they’ve done is set up a shelter for their animals. The animals are their livelihood and their lifeblood. Everybody’s been very appreciative of us coming to treat them. It’s clear they are very important to them, both financially and emotionally.

On the first day we met a woman in a village that had only a handful of buildings left standing. She was in a crumbled building with eight goats. Her husband is working in the Middle East – that’s quite common here. She said she’d lost everything, and these goats were all she had left. She was crying because she was worried about what would happen to them. We gave the goats some treatments to help with dehydration and antibiotics and they should survive.
We are helping people here, too, as well as their animals. We are sending humanitarian supplies like sanitary pads, disinfectant, mosquito coils, repellents, hand sanitiser, biscuits, protein bars, anything that we can do to help. Most of these supplies have been donated by corporates in India. If we’re on our way to help a cow and we meet a person without food, of course we stop and help.

Last week we took part in a ritual that our staff found very touching. There’s a woman who lives next to the Ganesh temple in Kamaladi near the centre of Kathmandu who looks after street dogs and is known as “the dog-mother of Kathmandu”. 
She’s like a goddess who sits with her dog disciples sleeping all around her. It’s quite a sight. All the dogs that live with her are really happy and healthy, all wagging their tails. None of them are tied up. They are are free to roam, but some of them are always near her. We went to see her and she was very emotional. She said she wanted to do something for all the forgotten animals who perished in the earthquake.
On the thirteenth day after the death of a family member there’s a Hindu ritual called “terva” in Nepali. The dog mother decided to do this for the animals and some of the Humane Society International team attended the ceremony. About 50 to 100 people were there, and anyone who passed by stopped to pay their respects. There were prayers. There was incense. It was exactly what someone would do for a beloved human being. As part of the ritual, we all went around the streets of Kathmandu distributing food to street dogs. It was good for our staff to be associated with something like this after exhausting days of working in the field. It felt good to mark the impact of this disaster on animals.

As told to Anna Leach.
