 An earthquake measuring 7.7 magnitude struck 80 km east of Pokhara in Nepal on Saturday, about halfway between the town and the capital Kathmandu, the US Geological Survey said, and witnesses said some buldings in Kathmandu had collapsed.   There was no immediate word on damage or casualties. The quake was 31 km deep.   Tremors were felt as far away as New Delhi and other northern cities in India, said witnesses. — Reuters
