Nepal faces a big hit to its economy as tour operators continued to cancel bookings to the country after a deadly earthquake struck at the weekend.
It welcomed nearly 800,000 tourists in 2013, whose spending contributed at least 2% to its GDP. Now many countries are advising against all but essential travel to Nepal as it struggles to recover from disaster. 
With many ancient temples and popular backpacking trails obliterated, a devastating blow to Nepal’s cultural heritage could be compounded by a jobs crisis if tourists go elsewhere.
The quakes have also scuppered government plans to promote Nepal, which boasts the world’s highest mountain as well as ancient Hindu and Buddhist heritage, as a hotspot destination for mountaineers, rock climbers and spiritual adventurers.

An executive at one tour operator, which runs regular backpacking trips to Nepal, said the immediate impact of the disaster on the country’s tourist industry had been devastating, but he hoped it would soon bounce back.

Michael Edwards, the UK managing director of Intrepid Travel, said the firm’s trips to the country had been cancelled until 11 May. 
The first wave of backpackers and hikers could return to Nepal as early as October, the beginning of the next trekking season, Edwards said, and the tourism industry would help. 
“Us and other operators will do our best to get people back there as soon as possible,” he said. “We’ve all got appeals going at the moment, we’ve all got staff that live there and we want to encourage people to go back there as soon as possible.”
Visitors attracted to Nepal’s heritage could take longer to return, he warned. “The more cultural side of tourism will take a little longer but I’m not anticipating that it will be as long as other countries,” Edwards said, giving the example of Japan, where fears of the fallout from the nuclear accident at Fukushima had kept many away.

Irina Bokova, the head of the UN cultural agency, Unesco, described the destruction to the country’s unique cultural blend of Hinduism and Buddhism as “heartbreaking”. She told Associated Press the preliminary assessment from her agency’s Kathmandu office was a “huge disaster”, with three of the seven places of worship in the extensive world heritage site in and around the region severely damaged.
They include one of the most important, the Durbar Square in Kathmandu, which held pagodas and temples from the 15th to 18th centuries, she said. Unesco said on Monday the Durbar Squares in Patan and Bhaktapur were also almost fully destroyed.
“I will send as soon as possible a mission of experts to make an assessment and see what can be done in order to repair the damage, or maybe, in some cases, will try to reconstruct them,” Bokova said.
Nepal’s tourism ministry says 797,616 tourists visited the country in 2013, the latest year for which figures were available, with each spending an estimated US$42.80 per day.

The visits contributed 1.97% to the country’s GDP, but this proportion was believed to be conservative because it only covered hotels and restaurants. “Large numbers of other direct and indirect sectors have not been included in these estimates,” a tourism ministry report said.
Estimates for the number of Nepalese employed in the tourism industry vary widely, even within the same report, with figures ranging from 38,148 to 178,000. 
After Saturday morning’s 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which struck 50 miles west of Kathmandu, the UK Foreign Office updated its travel advice to warn all but essential travel to the whole country. “If you’re in a safe place, you should stay where you are until it’s safe to leave,” the FCO said. “You should follow any advice provided by the local authorities. If you can leave Nepal safely then you should do so.”
Attempts to contact the Nepal tourist board were unsuccessful.
