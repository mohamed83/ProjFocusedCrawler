Prime Minister Narendra Modi today sought unity among Asian countries and said they must work as Asians to shape the world and reform the global institutions of governance, including the United Nations.

Noting that Asia of rivalries will hold the continent back, he asked the Asian countries to draw upon their shared heritage and youthful energy to pursue a common purpose.
