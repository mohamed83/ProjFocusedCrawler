Cristiano Ronaldo, who has been no stranger to charitable acts throughout his career, has donated £5m to the charity Save the Children to help their aid efforts in Nepal after the earthquake which killed more than 8,000 people and injured another 20,000 last month, according to reports in France.
The French football magazine So Foot reports that the 30-year-old Real Madrid player made the donation having previously asked his 100m Facebook followers to support the charity.
The Portugal striker, who scored in the 2-1 Champions League semi-final first-leg defeat at Juventus last week, is no stranger to such acts. Last year he paid for €60,000 worth of treatments for a 10-month-old boy with cortical dysplasia. He has also worked closely with Unicef and World Vision and in 2004 he flew to Indonesia having seen a survivor from the tsunami there wearing a shirt with his name on the back.
Real Madrid face Valencia in La Liga on Saturday night before entertaining Juve in the second leg of their last four tie on Wednesday.
