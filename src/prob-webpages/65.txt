(Press Trust of India)Patna / Darbhanga:                     A political tussle has broken out in Bihar over the compensation that is being paid to the families of the 70 people who lost their lives in the two massive earthquakes that struck the region in the past month. Allies-turned-foes BJP and the ruling JD (U) are now in a war of words over who should get credit for the Rs 6 lakh compensation that is being given to the families of those killed in the earthquake.
At least two Union Ministers, while visiting the state, have claimed that the share of the state government is only Rs 1 lakh, with the remaining Rs 5 lakh coming from the Centre."We are trying to give 6 lakh rupees to the families at the soonest. Out of this, 4 lakhs are being being given by the state government. Even in that amount, the Centre's share is 3 lakh rupees and the state's share is a lakh. The remaining 2 lakh rupees will be given from the PM's Relief Fund. We are trying to ensure the money reaches the families soonest," said Union Minister of State for Finance, Jayant Sinha, during a visit to Darbhanga.
But Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has hit out at BJP leaders, saying they are being "insensitive", saying no party can claim credit for compensation paid from government funds. "All of this money is coming from designated funds. The money does not have anything to do with any government or a party. But these people will say what they want to. The know how to play politics," said Mr Kumar.
The JD (U)-led Bihar government also argues that hammering in the point about credit for the compensation only amounts to playing politics in an election year, where the Nitish Kumar's JD(U) and the BJP are expected to face off in a mega battle.
