The constant buzz of staying busy with constructive activities and meeting strangers who have the potential to be friends.  One law you would like to break... Law of diminishing marginal utility! We would be never dissatisfied and never get bored of what we have. There will be no heartbreaks!  Best pick-up line you have ever heard... Pick up lines have typically grossed me out. So, none!  Rate in order of priority the three qualities that every woman must possess... Self-reliance, grace and compassion  One achievement that will make you feel your life was a huge success... To represent India across all types of international platforms, whether beauty pageants or business conclaves.  The last movie that made you cry... The girl next door  Rate in order of personal preference, the three qualities that you admire in a man... Honesty, diligence, gravitas  What is the craziest rumour you have heard about yourself... Even at age 6, my schoolmates used to believe that I wear red lipstick everyday!  With which celebrity would you like to go on a vacation... Robert Downey Jr. I would remain spellbound all the time.  If you were to give one bit of advice to the youth today, what would be that... Experiment and find yourself! Keep trying to learn new things and work on a wide variety of opportunities so that you have no regrets in life.  Your body to you means... A mythical medium to let my soul develop and achieve its full potential.  Favourite actor... Farhan Akhtar, particularly for the philanthropic work he does outside of his mainstream career.  Favourite movies... The Iron man series  Love is... Selfless desire to care for and protect without expectations, despite of various hurdles and hardships.  videoMiss India Swiss Diaries: Day 2videoDay 3 for the beauty queens in SwitzerlandvideoMiss India 2015 finalists receive Eye Tex tutorials - Part 5videoMiss India 2015 finalists receive Eye Tex tutorials - Part 6videoMiss India Swiss Diaries: Day 1photo3 PhotosMiss India 2015 Aditi Arya at the launch of iSpace Recently crowned as fbb Femina Miss India 2015 Aditi Arya was seen sizzling at the store launch of iSpace in Meerut.photo4 PhotosTake a look at gorgeous Aditi Arya at Nutricharge event in Kolkata Miss India World 2015, Aditi Arya strikes a pose at the Nutricharge event in Kolkata.Jewelry by Curio Cottage Styled by Surabhi Sharmaphoto5 Photos​Miss India World Aditi Arya attends Nutricharge event in Delhi Stunning Aditi Arya strikes a pose at the Nutricharge event in Delhi.Outfit Credit: Deepankshi & Reena Jewelry by Curiocottage and styled by Surabhi Sharmaphoto5 PhotosMiss India 2015 Aditi Arya dazzle at the Nutricharge event in Raipur Miss India World 2015, Aditi Arya poses for a picture before the Nutricharge event in Raipur.Designer Credits: Aditi Arya - Karleo; Sushruti Krishna - Deepankshi and Reenaphoto10 PhotosMiss Indias at NRI of the Year Awards (From L to R) fbb Femina Miss India 2015 first runner-up Aafreen Vaz, fbb Femina Miss India 2015 Aditi Arya and fbb Femina Miss India 2015 second runner-up Vartika Singh at the Times Now NRI of the Yephoto6 PhotosGorgeous Aditi Arya visits her school in Gurgaon Miss India 2015, Aditi Arya visits her school Amity International School in Gurgaon.Outfit: Reboot by Anuj BhutaniRing is Malleka, and bracelet by Rara Avisphoto9 PhotosMiss India World 2015 Aditi Arya's Residential felicitation Miss India World 2015 Aditi Arya's received a warm residential felicitation by the neighbours who are proud of her achievements.Aditi is wearing a Ritika Bharwani outfit.photo5 PhotosAditi Arya's NGO visit to Protsahan Newly crowned fbb Femina Miss India 2015 Aditi Arya pays a visit to NGO Protsahan and spent some great time with children.photo6 PhotosErnst and Young!
