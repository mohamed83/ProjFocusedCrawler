Learn more about the U.S. response to the earthquake in Nepal and how you can help. 




AFP / Prakash Mathema




WASHINGTON, D.C. - Our thoughts are with the people of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh in the aftermath of the magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck central Nepal today, affecting more than 6.6 million people and causing widespread damage and destruction. USAID is deploying a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to the region and is providing an initial $1 million in emergency assistance as we assess humanitarian needs in cooperation with the Government of Nepal. USAID is also activating an Urban Search and Rescue Team to accompany disaster experts.
The earthquake, which hit just northwest of Nepal's densely populated capital, Kathmandu, has caused numerous buildings to collapse and made some roads impassable. It also triggered an avalanche in the Mount Everest region and aftershocks of a considerable magnitude. In addition to the DART, USAID staff based in Bangkok, Thailand and Washington, D.C. are monitoring the situation closely in coordination with U.S. mission disaster relief officers in the region.
The American people have a proud and generous history of providing help during times of crisis. USAID remains committed to helping the people of Nepal and the region during this difficult time.
