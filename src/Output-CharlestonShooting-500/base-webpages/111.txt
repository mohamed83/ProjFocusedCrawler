CSU responds to Charleston shooting
University Relations
The Charleston Southern University family’s thoughts and prayers go out to all the
                        individuals affected by the shooting last night at Emanuel AME Church.
“We are especially mourning the loss of Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, the mother of
                        rising sophomore Chris Singleton," said President Jairy C. Hunter Jr. "Chris is a member of our baseball team. The CSU family is praying for Chris and his
                        family during this painful time. CSU coaches and campus ministers are assisting the
                        Singleton family as they deal with this tragedy.”
Head coach Stuart Lake said the players and coaches are hurting and are praying for
                        Chris and his family. “Chris’s mother was just that parent that as a coach you are
                        proud to have as part of your program. What she brought to our team is immeasurable,”
                        said Lake.
Charleston Southern is planning a prayer vigil on Monday, June 22 at 11:30 a.m. in
                        the Whitfield Center for Christian Leadership on the campus.

Charleston Southern is a liberal arts university and is one of South Carolina’s largest
                           accredited, independent universities, enrolling 3,400 students. Recognized as one
                           of America’s Best Christian Colleges, the University’s vision is to be a Christian
                           university nationally recognized for integrating faith in learning, leading and serving.
