(CNN) — [Latest developments]
— An official close to the investigation told CNN there are multiple fatalities inside the church. The source said there are several bodies in the church that have not yet been identified.
— The suspect in the shooting is a clean-shaven white man in his 20s, with a slender build, police say.
— Police are asking anyone with information about the shooting to call 911 dispatchers.
[Full story]
Several people were killed in a shooting at an historic African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina, a source close to the investigation told CNN.
The shooter is still at large.
The shooting took place Wednesday evening at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. On its website, the church describes itself as the “oldest AME church in the South.”
“It’s really bad. It’s a very bad scene,” local pastor Thomas Dixon said.
“Apparently the person just entered the church and opened fire. That part has not been fully articulated on what happened yet … they are still looking for the suspect.”
Search on for suspect
Police haven’t said how many people have been shot. But the source who spoke to CNN said several bodies were in the church that were yet to be identified.
Police said the suspect in the shooting is a clean-shaven white man in his 20s, with a slender build. He was wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and boots.
Soon afterward, news camera showed officers taking a man matching that description into custody, but police said they were still looking for the shooter.
The department asked anyone with information about the shooting to call 911 dispatchers
Heavy police presence
Every Wednesday evening, the church holds a Bible study in its basement.
Corey Wessenger, who was standing across the street from the church, said the area was swarming with law enforcement.
“I just saw a group of about 40 people escorted by cops,” Wessenger told CNN by phone.
Community members gathered in a prayer circle just down the street from the scene.
Patrick Wright, a reporter with WFMY News, tweeted, “We’ve been told not to leave our restaurant here in #Charleston for the time being. Helicopter still circling above.”

There was a time when citizens could by dynamite and blasting caps at the hardware store to blast tree stumps.  Nobody thought twice about it, and nobody used it to hurt other people.  Those days of human decency are gone.
