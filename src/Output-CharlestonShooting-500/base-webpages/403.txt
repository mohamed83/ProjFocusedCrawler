Police captured the white suspect in a gun massacre at one of the oldest black 
  churches in the United States, the latest deadly assault to feed simmering 
  racial tensions. Police detained 21-year-old Dylann Roof, shown wearing the 
  flags of defunct white supremacist regimes in pictures taken from social 
  media, after nine churchgoers were shot dead during a bible study meeting.
