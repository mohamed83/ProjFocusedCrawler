FBI investigates Warrenville church fire 










The cause of the fire at Warren­ville’s Glover Grove Baptist Church has been classified as undetermined, according to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division.
“Agents were unable to determine an exact origin or fire cause,” SLED spokeswoman Kathryn Richardson said in a news release. “As a result, agents were unable to eliminate all accidental ignition sources.”
After testing evidence, “investigators observed no element of criminal intent,” the release stated.
Midland Valley firefighters were called to the church about 3:30 a.m. Investigators from the Aiken County Sher­iff’s Office, ATF and FBI processed the scene.
The church, which has about 35 active members, was established about 130 years ago and was at its current location for about 30 years. The fire came the same week as three other fires at Southern black churches and a week after nine black churchgoers were killed in Charleston, S.C.

Put to rest 


This was an awful tragedy for this Church and its congregation, and I am glad that it was not an act of violence. Please,  lets put this tragic accident to rest and move on.

Obama Calls Them Out These Christians  


With president Obama's national call that all these homophobic bigoted , intolerant
" Christians "   should be :
                " Taken down off of their high horse "  ( Obama )
It is not surprising that his national orders being fulfilled is not a possibility .

There's part of the problem in this country 


People who call themselves "christians", but are full of hate and lies. Maybe they just don't have the mental capacity to listen to speeches and put the words together correctly, or even to look up correct quotes, and instead try to put words in people's mouths. "GET" of your high horse vs. being "TAKEN' of your high horse has two very different meanings, but lying, hating, racist, intolerant, bigoted, homophobic, so-called "christians" know that. You see, they aren't Christian. They use religion as their weapon and their excuse to attack others. Take your religion and take it far away because the United States on America is not,and was never intended to be a theocracy. You don't get to force your religion onto others. You can spout your hate and craziness all you want and everyone with any brains and intelligence can laugh at you and all of the rest of the hatemongers in the world. When you and the rest try to use your religion as an excuse to force your beliefs on others, the forces of freedom will stop you. You're no different than ISIS. Now stop trying to lie and misquote others and calling yourself a Christian and work on trying to look up a correct quote every now and then so you don't bear false witness.

Oh don't worry, one of the usual right wing gang will flag my above post and it will get pulled. You see, the right wingers get to lie about the President, lie about anything, misquote, put in total nonsense, BUT your not allowed to point out that it's total nonsense. Just like  with the editor, lies (by right wingers) are allowed, POINTING OUT THEY ARE LIES, is what is not allowed.

Take off your blinders and read the 7:24. He even admitted it would probably be  reported and get removed. That in and of itself was a hateful statement.

Please note, at the bottom of 


Please note, at the bottom of every post is an "Ignore user" option. I suggest you click that if you choose to ignore factual posts. That way only the propaganda of the editor, the rantings of the usual right wing crowd, and the Bible verses from the hatemongers, racists, and bigots will show.

"I see no hate in Bod's post on this one." 


Gee whiz, HL.. You were being sardonic, right?  Just  how do you interpret...
"People who call themselves "christians", but are full of hate and lies." and further are.."lying, hating, racist, intolerant, bigoted, homophobic, so-called "christians" "
Bod habitually posts almost nothing but hate.
Gotta wonder just how he/she arrived at the conclusion that (apparently all)  Christians are "full of hate and lies".
I don't think I've ever seen anyone so consumed with hate and invective.
Nice!
