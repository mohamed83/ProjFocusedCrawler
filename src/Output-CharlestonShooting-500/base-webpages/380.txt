Crazed: Roof wearing Apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia flags


 A gunman who killed nine churchgoers in a hate fuelled rampage told his victims: “I have to do this. You rape our women and you’re taking over our country. And you have to go.” The killer - named by the FBI today as 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof - spared one woman to ‘tell the world what happened’ during Wednesday’s massacre. Roof was taken alive by traffic police today after a frantic 14-hour manhunt. FBI agents had scoured Charleston, South Carolina since Roof allegedly targeted a weekly bible study group at the 150-year-old Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church there. Roof - pictured on his Facebook page wearing a jacket emblazoned with the flags of Apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia - had remained on the loose for 14 hours as FBI and SWAT teams put Charleston into lockdown.

 He was caught in 245 miles away in Shelby, North Carolina. A member of the public spotted his car and called the police to report ‘suspicious activity’, according to Charleston police chief Greg Mullen. When armed officers approached him they found him with his gun but he offered no resistance when arrested. Charleston Mayor Joe Riley said: “In America, we don’t let bad people like this get away.” One eye witnesses to the killings told how Roof, who was given a .45 calibre pistol by his father for his birthday two months ago, remained ‘as cold as ice’ as he opened fire, killing three men and six women. One female survivor said the killer reloaded five times and at one point was spoken to by the son of a churchgoer who tried to “talk him out of doing the act of killing people”.

 They also recalled how he told one parishioner to ‘tell the world’ what they had seen and how a an elderly women told her granddaughter to play dead when the shooter started firing. President Obama expressed his anger at the killings today, saying such incidents of gun violence do not happen in other advanced countries. In a statement to reporters at the White House, he said he and wife Michelle knew the pastor of the church who was killed.

 Following the massacre, officers also investigated a possible bomb threat but several hours later gave the all-clear. Police said the gunman entered the church around 8pm before taking part in the prayer group for about an hour. They received the first call about the shooting shortly after 9pm. Paramedics found eight people dead inside the church, and one was taken to hospital where they later died, chief Mullen said. He added that three survivors were found inside the church and have been taken to hospital.

 Roof duped the group into believing he was interested in the church, often referred to as ‘Mother Emanuel’, after taking part in their studies for an hour before pulling out his gun and opening fire. Among the victims was 41-year-old Reverend Clementa Pinckney, pastor of the church who the killer had asked for and sat next to at the meeting and a South Carolina state senator.   Pinckney’s cousin Sylvia Johnson said: “At the conclusion of the Bible study, from what I understand, they just start hearing loud noises ringing out and he had already been wounded. “The suspect already wounded a couple of individuals.” Another cousin, Kent Williams said: “It’s a huge, huge loss. A sad, sad thing that has happened.”

   As Roof went on the run armed police, SWAT and FBI agents flooded into the area to track him down. Authorities released images of the suspect and vowed to apprehend him while a shaken community tried to come to terms with why someone would open fire on one of America's oldest African-American churches. “This is an unfathomable and an unspeakable act by somebody filled with hate and with a deranged mind this person is dangerous,” Mayor Joe Riley Jr. said “We needed every tip to bring this person into custody.”

 Chief Mullen added the suspect was not be confronted by the public. Roof was said by witnesses to have been driving a black ‘distinctive’ getaway car, which police believed to be his Hyundai and still in the Charleston area. They had warned the public to be on the look out for the vehicle which has the licence plate LGF 300. “We do not want more people harmed to approach him or follow the vehicle,” Mullen said. “Because of the pain and the hurt that this individual has caused this community, this entire community, we will catch this individual. “He is dangerous and should not be approached and anybody who sees him should call 911."

He added: “We believe this is a hate crime. That is how we are investigating it. The tragedy that we’re addressing right now is indescribable. “No one in this community will ever forget this night. We are committed to do whatever is necessary to bring this individual to justice. “We are not leaving any stone unturned.” Roof’s uncle, Carson Cowles, said his nephew had received a .45 calibre pistol as a birthday present in April. He called him a “quiet, soft spoken” boy and said he recognised him in the CCTV images released by police from the scene of the shooting. Today police interviewed his family, hoping for clues as to why he may have carried out the shooting. According to US court records, Roof was arrested on April 26 previously on a trespassing charge and was awaiting for the case to be dealt with. He was arrested on March 3 for possession of a controlled substance in Lexington County which led to his police mugshot being taken.

 One former schoolmate, John Mullins, described Roof as being “kind of wild”. “He used drugs heavily a lot,” Mullins said. "Obviously harder [stuff] than marijuana. He was like a pill popper, from what I understood. “Like Xanax, and stuff like that." America’s Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, along with the FBI and the US Attorney’s Office have launched a hate crime investigation into the mass shooting. Charleston’s National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People President Dot Scott said although the church was predominantly used by black people it was not unusual to see whites attend. Mayor Riley added: “We’re going to put our arms around this church. “The only reason that someone could walk into a church and shoot people praying is out of hate,. “It is the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine, and we will bring that person to justice. “This is one hateful person."

Horror: Attack has shocked America


 A family assistance centre has been set up in downtown Charleston for those who lost their loved ones. Officials are investigating whether the massacre was timed to coincide with two large political rallies in the city. Just hours before being killed Rev Pinckney met with Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton as part of her campaign and Republican Jeb Bush was also due to visit Charleston today but his appearance was cancelled. In a statement, the Bush campaign said: “Governor Bush’s thoughts and prayers are with individuals and families affected by this tragedy.” Meanwhile Hillary Clinton tweeted: “Heartbreaking news from Charleston - my thoughts and prayers are with you all.” Illustrious history behind Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church

April 1962: Martin Luther King gives speech in church


 The roots of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church run deep in America’s history. It is known as one of the leading lights in the fight against racial hostility. Built during a tide of discrimination it was once razed to the ground in hate only for it to be built again. The congregation was first formed in 1791, a coalition of freed African-Americans blacks and slaves. At first the group was part of Charleston’s Methodist Episcopal Church but in 1816, they left their white counterparts in a dispute over burial grounds. At the time, the church was 1,400 members strong. They rallied behind the leadership of a pastor named Morris Brown and organised under the banner of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Denmark Vesey - one of the founders - was a leader of a failed slave revolt in 1822 which when discovered saw the church burned to the ground by whites. Authorities also arrested 313 alleged participants, and executed 35, including Vesey. Due to its standing in the country it earned the nickname of 'Mother Emanuel' - a place African-Americans look to for help and support in the fight for equal rights. The church was rebuilt in 1891, replacing the original building which had been damaged by 1886 earthquake. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King gave a speech at the church in April 1962. The massacre of nine of its followers on Wednesday has once again forced the church to confront the ongoing, ugly face of racial discord in the States.
