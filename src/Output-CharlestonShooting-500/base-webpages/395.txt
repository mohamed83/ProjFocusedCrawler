Protesters burn a paper Confederate flag during a rally 











In the wake of the horrific Charleston shooting last week, a viral challenge asking Americans to torch the Confederate flag is burning up social media. Using the hashtag #BurnThatFlag, over 4,000 people have tweeted their support with plenty sharing pictures and videos. On Facebook, an event has been created that marks Saturday, June 27 as National Burn the Confederate Flag Day. Nearly 9,500 people have said they will attend.  The Confederate flag has long been a divisive symbol in the States because of it's links to the American Civil War.

 This is what I feel about your racist flag and your racist ideology! #BurnTheFlag #ConfederateTakeDown pic.twitter.com/XxA0KAW84d— Damion Morse (@MBLAK100) June 23, 2015

 Dylann Roof, who is being held over the Charleston killings, once held it in a photograph and reportedly told friends he wanted to start a "race war". Predictably, the viral challenge has become highly controversy and plenty of people have joined the online argument. "That's my flag, it represents my heritage and history just as much as that star spangled banner," posted one user objecting to the flag burning Facebook event. "The KKK is a political party.. Get over yourself, it exists, they've had peaceful rallies just as the rest of the white, black, Hispanic or any other racially based party," he wrote. "These people who are gonna burn the rebel flag are the same disrespectful ***** that are doing **** like stomping on the American flag, trying to ban firearms, and are trying to legalize gay marriage to make people "happy".

 Even the hacker collective Anonymous has got in on the action.  Never one to miss a spot of online racism, the group has tweeted an image of both the American flag and the Isreali flag burning.  #TakeDownTheFlag and #BurnTheFlag why settle for just one? Burn them all. pic.twitter.com/D7Y8nAn3lP— Anonymous (@YourAnonCentral) June 23, 2015

Meanwhile, Dylann Roof could face the death penalty for his actions. Amazingly, relatives of the victims of the Charleston church massacre offered their 'forgiveness' to the gunman after confronting him in court.
