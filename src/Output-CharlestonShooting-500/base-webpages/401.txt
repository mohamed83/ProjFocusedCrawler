Police have released a recording of the 911 call that led to the arrest of racist gunman Dylann Roof.
In the clip, Todd Frady, the owner of a flower shop in the town of Kings Mountain in South Carolina, tells a police dispatcher in nearby Shelby that one of his drivers believes he’s seen the Charleston shooter.
Frady is then transferred to an officer who asks further questions about where the suspected shooter is.
Frady also describes the suspect and the car, saying: "Black Hyundai, it has this weird circle tag on the front, and the boy has a bowl-lookin’ haircut."
After the shooting that left nine dead at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina last Wednesday, Roof fled in his black Hyundai car 250 miles north.
He was finally apprehended in Shelby after 14 hours on the run.
