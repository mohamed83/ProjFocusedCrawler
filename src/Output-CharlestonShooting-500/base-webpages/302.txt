On Thursday, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, the suspect in the South Carolina church shooting, was arrested and taken into custody. Authorities have opened up a hate crime investigation and many more are wondering if Roof was tied into any hate groups. Manny Gomez, a former FBI agent and Stanley Czwakiel of Cambridge Security Services, talk about protecting religious institutions.
