        COMMENTEMAILMOREMore than half of the suspects in U.S. mass killings are eventually sentenced to prison or death, suggesting the final outcome for  Dylann Storm Roof — who faced charges in court today in connection with the shooting nine people in a Charleston church — may be fairly clear.Of the 217 people who have been accused of a mass killing and didn't die at the scene, 132 were sentenced to prison and 15 were sentenced to death, according to USA TODAY data on mass killings since 2006. About 62 suspects are awaiting trial or sentencing, and two were institutionalized or put in a youth rehabilitation program.Three times charges have been dropped against suspects, and three people have been acquitted of a mass killing, including Edward Washington, charged with killing four people in a Boston home invasion. Two other men involved in the crime were sentenced to prison.One-third of mass killers never leave the scene alive. About 27% commit suicide and about 6% are killed by police.USATODAY.COMBEHIND THE BLOODSHED: THE UNTOLD STORY OF AMERICA'S MASS KILLINGSIt's rare for police to not have a named suspect. Of the 279 incidents in the past 10 years, only 11 remain unsolved. Most of them are drug- and gang-related, although the shootings of five women at a suburban Chicago Lane Bryant store in 2008 has never been solved.While it's unclear why the killing occurred at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church during a prayer service, there have been several other cases where a church was involved.• In August 2012, Wade M. Page, 40, lead guitarist in a white-power band named End Apathy, entered a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., and killed six with a handgun. He wounded three, including a police officer. After police shot Page in the stomach, he killed himself.• In Baton Rouge, La. in 2006, Anthony Bell opened fire in a church, killing four. He fled with his family at gunpoint. He killed his wife but released their three kids unharmed. His death sentence is on appeal.• Matthew Murray, 24, was dropped from the missionary program of New Life Church in Arvada, Colo. In 2007, five years later, he returned and shot two people then drove 80 miles to the evangelical church itself, where he killed two others before committing suicide.
