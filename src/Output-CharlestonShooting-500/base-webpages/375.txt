Charged: Dylann Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder following the shocking killings in America











Dylann Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder following the Charleston church massacre.  The 21-year-old also been charged with possession of a firearm following the deaths of nine people at a church in South Carolina.  A bail hearing is due to take place later today but he is not expected to appear.  The accused was captured by police following a frantic 14-hour manhunt.  He was quizzed by the FBI over the shootings at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston on Wednesday night.

Accused Gunman: Roof is facing calls for the death penalty if he is convicted of the horrific killings


   Authorities believe he sat in a Bible study group with his victim for almost an hour before the rampage took place.  Police branded the killings as a hate crime and there have been calls for Roof to face the death penalty if convicted.  FBI agents had scoured Charleston, South Carolina for the suspect after the shocking attack at the 150-year-old church, once visited by civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King Jr.

Hate Crime: Police took Roof into custody after a 14 hour manhunt, and have branded the incident a hate crime


   Roof - pictured on his Facebook page wearing a jacket emblazoned with the flags of Apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia - had remained on the loose for 14 hours as FBI and SWAT teams put Charleston into lockdown.   He was caught in 245 miles away in Shelby, North Carolina. A member of the public spotted his car and called the police to report ‘suspicious activity’, according to Charleston police chief Greg Mullen. When armed officers approached him they found him with his gun but he offered no resistance when arrested.

 President Obama expressed his anger at the killings, saying such incidents of gun violence do not happen in other advanced countries. In a statement to reporters at the White House, he said he and wife Michelle knew the pastor of the church who was killed. Following the massacre, officers also investigated a possible bomb threat but several hours later gave the all-clear.
