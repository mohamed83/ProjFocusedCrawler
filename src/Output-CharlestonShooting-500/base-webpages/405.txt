Charleston shooting: how the day unfolded

Take a look at how the day unfolded after a lone shooter entered a church 
  service and massacred nine people in Charleston, South Carolina 














 



							By Robert Midgley and reporters

10:51PM BST 18 Jun 2015
 


 A white supremacist gunman who massacred nine people inside a historic African-American church in the southern city of Charleston has been arrested after a day on the run.  The suspect Dylann Storm Roof, 21, was captured 14 hours after the shooting but the killing spree left the United States agonising over how to face up to the bloodiest hate crime in decades.  "This is not the first time that black churches have been attacked," said President Barack Obama. "We know that hatred across races and faiths pose a particular threat to our democracy and our ideals."  Watch the video above of how the day unfolded following the massacre.
