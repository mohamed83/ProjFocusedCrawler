About an hour after Dylann Roof entered the Emanuel AME Church on Wednesday night, he stood up, “pulled out a handgun and began shooting,” according to an affidavit filed by Charleston police detective Richard Burckhardt. “All victims were hit multiple times,” he stated. “All victims died as a result of their injuries.” Burckhardt is listed on the Charleston Police Department’s site as one of the five people on the force’s homicide unit. Roof, 21, spent about an hour with parishioners during Bible study before shooting them, the affidavit states. The document does not state what, if anything, occurred in the moments before he began shooting. The affidavit states that before leaving the room, he stood over someone “and uttered a racially inflammatory statement to the witness.” [Officials: The gunman was unrepentant while confessing to police] Video surveillance at the church captured Roof leaving the building shortly after 9 p.m. carrying a handgun, the affidavit states. As word of the shooting began to spread, police released photos of the gunman they were seeking to identify and capture. According to the affidavit, Roof’s father and uncle contacted the Charleston Police Department and identified him. On Friday, the Justice Department said that it is investigating the shooting “from all angles, including as a hate crime and as an act of domestic terrorism.”     The 21-year-old white man accused of fatally shooting nine people in a historic black South Carolina church made his first court appearance.
