Relatives of victims of the Charleston church massacre have offered their 'forgiveness' to the gunman after confronting him in court. Dylann Roof, 21, who could face the death penalty, sat for an hour with members of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina before opening fire massacring six women and three men. He has told investigators he carried out the shootings telling them “I wanted to start a race war,” but said he almost didn’t go through with it after the way they had welcomed him in to their group. Today, after he provided graphic details to police of his attack as he admitted carrying out the killings, he was charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a firearm in the commission of of violent crime.

Forgiveness: The daughter of victim Ethel Lance (pictured) forgave Roof in court


     This afternoon Roof appeared in court in Charleston. Stood in a stripped prison jump suit he starred vacantly as he appeared via CCTV often avoiding the camera. Responding to Judge James Gosnell he only spoke to confirm his address, age and to state that he is unemployed. The chief magistrate then read out the nine counts of murder as well as one count of possession of a firearm in the commission of of violent crime.  Judge Gosnell asked a relative of each of those killed whether they wanted to address the court. One by one, those who chose to speak at the bond hearing did not turn to anger.

   Instead, they offered him forgiveness and said they were praying for his soul. Looking at Roof the daughter of grandmother Ethel Lance, 70, said: “I forgive you. Lord have mercy on your soul. “I will never talk to her ever again, but I forgive you.” “You hurt me. You hurt a lot of people but I forgive you.” Felicia Sanders, the mother of victim Tywanza Sanders and who survived the shooting by playing dead, said: “We welcomed you Wednesday night in our Bible study with welcome arms. “Every fibre in my body hurts, and I will never be the same.

Appearance: Roof admitted to carrying out massacre


 "As we said in the Bible study, we enjoyed you. “Tywanza Sanders was my son. “Tywanza Sanders was my hero. Tywanza was my all. “May God have mercy on you.” A representative of Myra Thompson, 59, one of those killed added: “I forgive you and my family forgives you. “Repent and confess and give your life to Christ and change your ways. You’ll be better off than you are now.” Roof remained impassive as each relative spoke. Judge Gosnell explained he could not set bond for the murder charges, but said he set bond for $1 million (£630,000) for charge of possessing a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.  He told Roof would appear in court in October and again in February 2016. His appearance came it emerged Roof’s sister called authorities to report her brother as the Charleston shooter after seeing surveillance photos on television. Amber Roof, 27, rang the FBI as he was still on the loose which led to vital clues to help apprehend him.
