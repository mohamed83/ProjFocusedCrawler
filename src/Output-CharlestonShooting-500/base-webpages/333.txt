Dylann Storm Roof, the 21-year-old white male who authorities say opened fire on a historic black church in Charleston, has been booked at Cannon Detention Center after being extradited to South Carolina to face charges. His bond hearing is scheduled for Friday at 2 p.m., according to local reports.

Police arrested Storm late Thursday morning during a traffic stop in Shelby, North Carolina, which is about 250 miles from Charleston. He was apprehended after a citizen tipped off police after spotting a car and driver matching the description police had released for Roof. After his arrest, he waived his extradition rights.
Roof fled the scene and was at large for hours after killing nine people. The Department of Justice and FBI have launched a hate crime investigation into the shooting.

Witnesses said the suspect sat with attendees of the prayer meeting for an hour before he turned his gun on them. 
Later Thursday, Mashable obtained a Snapchat posted by one of the victims just before the shooting began. Friends allege the video posted to the social media platform shows Roof sitting with the prayer group.

Three men and six women were killed, including the pastor, a librarian, a recent college grad and a track coach. Three people survived.
One woman, who said she was a cousin of the church's pastor, South Carolina state Sen. Rev. Clementa Pinckney, told NBC News late Wednesday night that the shooter reloaded five different times and told a survivor, "I have to do it. You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go."

The Associated Press spoke with Joseph Meek Jr. on Thursday, an old friend of Roof's who said he had recently reconnected with him over Facebook. Meek alleged that Roof spent time ranting about racially-divisive incidents like the shooting of Trayvon Martin and the death of Freddie Gray. 
"He said blacks were taking over the world. Someone needed to do something about it for the white race," Meek said. "He said he wanted segregation between whites and blacks. I said, 'That's not the way it should be.' But he kept talking about it."

In a Facebook photo, Roof is seen scowling at the camera wearing a jacket with two flags: one representing Rhodesia and the other apartheid South Africa. Both were countries with white minority rule. (Rhodesia was in the country now known as Zimbabwe. After an international campaign against apartheid, South Africa began dismantling the policies in 1990.)

He had been arrested in March at a Columbia mall and charged with possession of a narcotic painkiller, Mother Jones reported. He was also reportedly given a warning for trespassing "which he violated a couple weeks later," said Ken Mathews, a lawyer who represented Roof for those charges, in an interview with the website. Mathews said he was "very shocked" to hear about the shooting, adding, "The dealings I had with him, he was just a normal kid."
