Funeral plans are being announced for Clementa Pinckney, the South Carolina state senator who was one of nine people killed in the shooting spree at a Charleston church on 17 June.
A spokesman for Leevy’s funeral home in Columbia confirmed the details to the State newspaper.
Pinckney’s casket will be at the State House, the South Carolina legislature, for public viewing on Wednesday afternoon, according to the funeral listing, with additional public viewings on Thursday at a Columbia church and at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church where Pinckney was shot.
The funeral is set for 11am on Friday at TD Arena on the College of Charleston campus.
Dylann Roof is charged with nine counts of murder in the apparently racially motivated killing of Pinckney and the other victims.

On Saturday, hundreds of protesters walked down the streets of Charleston chanting “black lives matter” and “we can’t take it no more”.
In the evening a large crowd demonstrated against the presence of the Confederate flag on the grounds of the State House, where Pinckney’s casket is to lie in state. Calling the flag a symbol of hatred not heritage, the protesters chanted “take it down” in a rally that ended with a chorus of civil rights anthem “We Shall Overcome”.
Police say 21-year-old Roof went to the church and joined a Bible study group, then opened fire.
