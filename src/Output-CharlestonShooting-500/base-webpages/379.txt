Statement: President Obama said the country needs to reflect on its levels of gun violence











Barack Obama has said America 'needs to get to grips' with gun violence after nine people were shot dead at a church in South Carolina. The President addressed the nation as suspected gunman Dylann Roof, 21, was being quizzed by FBI officers over last night's tragedy. Speaking at a press conference, the president said "I have made statements like this too many times" and vowed to push for a change in gun laws. He said: "There is something particularly heartbreaking about tragedy happening in a place in which we seek solace, we seek peace, in a place of worship. "I have had to make statements like this too many times. 
"Communities have endured tragedies too many times. "Someone who wanted the inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun. "Let's be clear, as a country we will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence doesn't happen in other advanced countries."

Flags: Dylann Roof is pictured wearing the flags of racist African states


 Obama added he and his wife, Michelle, knew the pastor of the church, Clementa Pinckney, who was killed. The President said he and Vice President Joe Biden telephoned Charleston Mayor Joseph P Riley Jr to express condolences. Meanwhile, pictures have emerged showing suspected gunman Dylann Roof wearing the flags of 'racist' African states. The shootings - in the historically black church - are being investigated as hate crimes. Roof had previously been pictured wearing the flags of apartheid-era South Africa and the 'white-rule' state of Rhodesia. FBI agents flooded his neighbourhood in Shelby, Charlotte, before he was captured and taken into custody. Roof's uncle this afternoon revealed the suspect had received a gun as a birthday present by his father in April.

 Uncle Carson Cowles said he recognized Roof in a photo released by police, and described him as quiet and soft-spoken.   He added that Roof’s father gave him a .45-caliber pistol for his birthday this year. It was claimed this afternoon the suspected gunman said "I have to do it" before killing nine people inside a church, a survivor revealed. The female survivor of the Charleston church shooting said she had been allowed to live because the gunman wanted her to tell people what happened. The woman - who has not been identified - also told how the gunman spoke to her before he launched his killing spree.

 Fox News reports that Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of Pastor Clementa Pinckney who was killed in the shooting, spoke to one of the survivors and revealed what she had said. "She said that he had reloaded five different times… and he just said ‘I have to do it. 
"You rape our women and you’re taking over our country and you have to go." Nine people were shot dead after a white man opened fire in an African-American church last night. It emerged this afternoon he had sat with his victims for an hour before opening fire.

The chilling details of the killings emerged as police warned the man was still on the run and should not be approached by the public. Police later released his image as they desperately searched for the gunman. Eight victims were found dead in the church, Chief Gregory Mullen told reporters at a media conference, and a ninth person died after being taken to a hospital. One other person was wounded and receiving treatment following the shocking incident in Charleston, South Carolina. Mullen said: "It is unfathomable that somebody in today's society would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives." But the Reverend Al Sharpton, the New York-based civil rights leader, said in a Tweet that the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, the church's pastor and a member of the state Senate, was among the fatalities.

Police sealed off the scene in the aftermath of the shootings


 Mr Pinckney was a 41-year-old state senator, married and a father of two. The shooting occurred at the Emanuel AME Church in the historic centre of downtown Charleston around 9pm local time (1am GMT), according to Charleston Police Department spokesman Charles Francis. After the shooting, a bomb threat was reported near the church, Charleston County Sheriff's Office spokesman Eric Watson said, and people who were gathered in the area were told by police to move back.
  Chief Mullen told the press conference that the all-clear had been given after checks following the bomb threat. A police chaplain was present at the scene of the shooting, and a helicopter with a searchlight hovered overhead as officers combed through the area.

Members of the community were united in grief outside the church


 "We pray for the families, they've got a long road ahead of them," Reverend James Johnson, a local civil rights activist, said during the impromptu prayer service. Police took a man with a backpack and a camera into custody, but later said they were still searching for a suspect in the shooting. Following the attack on the church, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, cancelled an appearance in Charleston that had been scheduled for Thursday morning. "Governor Bush's thoughts and prayers are with the individuals and families affected by this tragedy," his campaign team said in a statement.
  The website for the church said it has one of the largest and oldest black congregations in the south. 
It has its roots in the early 19th century, and the current building was built in 1891. It is considered a historically significant building, according to the National Park Service.
