CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The Carolina Panthers have donated $100,000 to victims connected to the recent shooting at a South Carolina church that resulted in nine people being killed.
Bakari Sellers posted to Twitter an image of a letter from Panthers owner Jerry Richardson addressed to the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund in Charleston.
In the letter, the owner said he plans to donate $10,000 to each family and another $10,000 to the church.
“Our hearts are one with those who grieve the loss of these individuals,” Richardson wrote.
Dylann Roof, 21, is accused of killing nine people at a historically black Charleston, S.C. church during a Bible study Wednesday night. He’s currently in jail.
The victims have been identified as Cynthia Hurd, 54; Susie Jackson, 87; Ethel Lance, 70; Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Hon. Rev. Clementa Pinckney, 41; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; Rev. Sharonda Singleton, 45; Myra Thompson, 59.
