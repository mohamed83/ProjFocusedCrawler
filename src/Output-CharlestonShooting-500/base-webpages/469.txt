Emotional: Parishioners sing four days after the mass shooting 











The church which became the scene of a horrific mass shooting reopened its doors yesterday to become a house of worship again. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston held its first service since nine members of its Bible study group were assassinated last week by a race-hate gunman. Hundreds packed the service with many left outside as the South Carolina city continued to come together to in pray and astonishing forgiveness towards confessed killer Dylan Roof.

Saddened: Church member Mildridge Polite is helped into the church four days after a mass shooting


 Authorities have said the 21-year-old, of Lexington, South Carolina, has admitted he shot and killed the six women and three men after opening fire on them last Wednesday night. He pulled out his gun after an hour of being sat with the group and almost put a stop to his attack as “everyone was so nice to him”. Just before opening fire Tywanza Sanders stood in front of Roof placing himself between the killer and his elderly aunt, Susie Jackson, to try and protect her.

 Witnesses say the 26-year-old tried “talk him out of doing the act of killing people” to which the gunman replied “I have to do this. You rape our women and you’re taking over our country. And you have to go.” Mr Sanders urged him to point the gun at him instead of anyone else but was told: “It doesn’t matter. I’m going to shoot all of you.” Roof, who could face the death penalty, has told investigators he carried out the shootings telling them “I wanted to start a race war.” One of those killed was the church’s pastor, the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who had led Sunday services for several years before his death.

 The church remained a crime scene and off-limits to members until police released it Saturday. As mourners entered Emanuel its bells tolled nine times in memory of each of the victims. The Reverend Norvel Goff, presiding elder, gave the sermon as more than 800 churchgoers, who had queued for more than two hours to get inside, listened in sweltering 31c heat.

 Many constantly fanned themselves in an attempt to keep cool as police handed out chilled water inside. Officers were inside tasked with adding extra security. Reverend Goff told the congregation: “The devil entered and the devil tried to take charge. But the devil cannot take control of your people, and the devil cannot take control of your church. “We are reminded of the freshness of death. It comes like a thief in the night, “Many of our hearts are still broken. Many of us are still shedding tears. But we must take our burdens to the Lord and leave them there. “As we try to make sense of nonsense, pray for our children. We pray that God will give us the clarity of thought to share with them what God has shared with us.’ He then said: “We still believe prayer change things. Can I get a witness?”

His question was met with a resounding “Yes” by the congregation filled with both blacks and whites. “But prayer not only changes things, it changes us,” “We realise that in this life there is ups and downs. “We realised that there are dark days but there are so many bright days.” He finished off his sermon saying: “Evil cannot close our doors. God still sits on the throne. “The blood of the Emanuel nine requires us to stay on the battlefield until there is no more fighting to be fought.” Hundreds in the audience clapped as he spoke, others openly wept over their loss. In addition to Revervend Pinckney, who was also a state senator, the victims included DePayne Middleton-Doctor, Mr Sanders, Myrah Thompson, Ethel Lance, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Daniel Simmons Cynthia Hurd and Ms Jackson. For days the church had stood silent since the sound of gunfire broke out but now church goers replaced the quiet with a rousing number of songs.

 The front row seat in the choir normally occupied by Ms Jackson, 87, was left empty as a mark of respect. Charleston, nicknamed the Holy City because it has so many churches, remembered the shooting victims in other ways. At 10am all churches throughout the city rang their bells in solidarity along with many hundred more across America. City officials had also encouraged the rest of the world to “make a joyful noise” at the same time in support of the church, which is known as Mother Emanuel. Thousands gathered to form a unity chain on Charleston’s 13,200-foot-long Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge. Organisers attracted enough people to hold hands to stretch from Charleston to the town of Mount Pleasant on the other side of the Cooper River. “When something this horrendous happens this close to home, you are compelled to do something,” coordinator Dorsey Fairborn said. On Friday Roof appeared at a bond hearing. Families of the victims addressed him and said they forgave him.

 That message was yesterday echoed by Arthur Hurd, the husband of victim Cynthia Hurd. The merchant sailor only arrived back in Charleston on Saturday. “This is all surreal but what I can say to that young man is that in time I will forgive you,” Mr Hurd said. “I won’t move past this but I will forgive you. But I hope for the rest of your life, however long or short that may be, you stop and play that tape over and over and over again in your head and see the sheer terror and pain you put purely innocent people through. “I would love to hate you but hate’s not in me. If I hate you I’m no better than you.” On Saturday night hundreds took to the street to join the ‘March for Black Lives’. The group started in total silence as they walked to Emanuel AME Church from a nearby park, stopping outside the scene of the shootings to lay flowers at the makeshift memorial. They then continued onto Charleston’s iconic King Street, normally packed with tourists this time of year. Dozens carried signs reading “Hand in Hand,” “Do the right thing,” “Black Lives Matter,” and “STILL WE RISE,” were carried by marchers. The rally ended outside the historic Daughters of the Confederacy building. Addressing the crowd one speaker told the them: “That terrorist did not win. He wanted to invoke terror and fear in our community, but we are not for that “We are standing up together, arm in arm. We will not bow down, but we will stand up.” Others gathered in the South Carolina Capitol, Columbia where they called for the Confederate flag to be removed. “Take it down, take it down,” chanted the crowd filled with people of all races and ages holding signs. One woman’s placard read, “Love breeds love, hate breeds hate” and another man’s sign says, “Remove my ancestors sign.” The 150-year-old flag was originally used as a Civil War battle flag by the seven slave states that broke away from the Union in 1861. Due to their racist policies, many calling for the flag’s removal say it symbolizes hatred and white supremacy. It gained its modern meaning from the 1950s onwards when it was used in opposition to the Civil Rights movement that sought to end segregation and create equal right for blacks. In 1962, when the civil rights movement was rising up and then president John K Kennedy was putting pressure on the south to end segregation, South Carolina reacted by flying the flag in protest.

A petition on MoveOn.org has seen more than 350,000 people sign the petition which has also been supported by President Obama and opposition leader Mitt Romney. On Saturday investigators discovered a online manifesto written by Roof, which is now being investigated by the FBI as part of their race hate investigation. On it the confessed killer can be seen proudly waving the Confederate flag while burning the Stars and Stripes. The 2,500-word essay explains his thoughts on white superiority, saying the Trayvon Martin case “truly awakened me” and that “I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country.” Black teenager Martin was killed shot dead by an Hispanic neighbourhood watch coordinator who was later cleared of his death. Roof, who is now on suicide watch while in custody, has told investigators in Shelby, North Carolina, where he was arrested, he researched the church and targeted it because it turned out to be a “historic African-American church.” Three photos on his website show him posing with a pistol.

 One closeup shows a gun that can be identified as a.45-calibre Glock - the model of gun investigators say was used in the church shooting. Those photos were taken in April, after his 21st birthday, when his family said he purchased a handgun.

 On the website, called the Last Rhodesian a nod to the former last white supremacist country now called Zimbabwe, Roof is seen posing for pictures wearing a No. 88 T-shirt, had 88 Facebook friends and wrote that number - white supremacist code for “Heil Hitler”- on a beach. He wrote: “I have no choice. “I am not in the position to, alone, go into the ghetto and fight. “I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country. “We have no skinheads, no real KKK, no one doing anything but talking on the internet. “Well someone has to have the bravery to take it to the real world, and I guess that has to be me.” It was announced the nearest American football team, the Carolina Panthers, have donated $100,000 (£63,000) towards the funeral costs for the victims. Reverend Pinckney, who was also a state senator, will have his casket made available for public viewing on Wednesday and Thursday. He will be laid to rest on Friday at TD Arena on the College of Charleston campus. Details of the other funerals have not yet been announced.
