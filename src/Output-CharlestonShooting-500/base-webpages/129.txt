"It's real real hard. It's challenging because I don't believe she deserved to go this way. It hurts to process.”Susie Jackson was a longtime member of the church, and served in the choir and on the usher board. Tim Jackson said she was a very loving, giving person with a great smile.   “This is tragic because she's a very helpful person," said Jackson.Susie Jackson's son Walter Jackson is on his way to Charleston Thursday, his son Tim Jackson told newsnet5.com's Kristin Volk.Susie Jackson visited her family in Cleveland two weeks ago. “Just her being here about two weeks ago gave us a chance to see her smiling and laughing and saying hi to the grandkids," added Jackson.The vigil, at St. James AME at 8401 Cedar Avenue, will be at 4:30 p.m. newsnet5.com's Kristin volk and Leon Bibb are following this news today and will provide updates on  NewsChannel 5 this afternoon.NOTE: Originally newnet5.com reported that Susie Jackson was 98.--- Follow Kristin Volk on Facebook  and Twitter  Follow @Kristin_Volk  Download the newsnet5 app:   Apple   Android   Kindle
