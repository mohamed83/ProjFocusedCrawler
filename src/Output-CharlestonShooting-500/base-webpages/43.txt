Quick-thinking woman helps cops capture Charleston church shooting suspect

KING’S MOUNTAIN, N.C. — Police credit a quick-thinking North Carolina woman  for helping officers arrest a man accused of killing nine people Wednesday at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.
WGHP spoke with Debbie Dills who said she saw Dylann Storm Roof driving on Highway 74 west of Charlotte around 10 a.m. Thursday.
Dills told the station she recognized the suspect’s haircut.
Dills said she called her boss who called 9-1-1 while she followed the suspect and took note of his license plate.
“I was able to see him. I was able to get behind him. I was able to get his tag number. I was directly behind him at a stoplight,” Dills told FOX8.
“Everything going through my mind was what-ifs, but the only thing I could still see was those people in Charleston and those prayer circles with their hands gathered around praying that that prayer would be answered.”
Dills said withing five minutes police caught up with Roof, 21, and arrested him in Shelby, North Carolina.
The suspect
Police say Roof, of Lexington, South Carolina, shot and killed nine people inside the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, near the heart of Charleston’s tourist district. Eight died at the scene; a ninth died at a hospital.
After being caught 245 miles away from Charleston, he waived extradition and arrived back in South Carolina late Thursday.
He was armed with a gun when he was arrested, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. It’s not clear if it’s the same firearm used in the shooting.
A senior law enforcement source told CNN the suspect’s father had recently bought him a .45-caliber gun for his 21st birthday in April.
The victims
Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten identified the nine victims as follows: Cynthia Hurd, 54; Susie Jackson, 87; Ethel Lance, 70; Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Hon. Rev. Clementa Pinckney, 41; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; Rev. Sharonda Singleton, 45; Myra Thompson, 59.
Wooten told reporters that the victims all suffered gunshot wounds and died as a result of them.
Three people survived the shooting, including a woman who received a chilling message from the shooter.
“Her life was spared, and (she was) told, ‘I’m not going to kill you, I’m going to spare you, so you can tell them what happened,’ ” Charleston NAACP President Dot Scott told CNN. She said she heard this from the victim’s family members.
Federal authorities have opened a hate crime investigation into the shooting at the oldest AME church in the South, the Department of Justice said.
“The only reason someone would walk into a church and shoot people that were praying is hate,” Charleston Mayor Riley said.
It was not clear if the gunman targeted any individual.
“We don’t know if anybody was targeted other than the church itself,” Charleston police Chief Greg Mullen said.
