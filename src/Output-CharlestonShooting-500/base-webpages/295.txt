Security changes at local churches after Charleston massacre

GREENSBORO, N.C. — Rev. Henry Davis is taking extra steps to protect his congregation at Mt. Zion AME Church.
“I’m real watchful,” Davis said. “I’m observing my congregation; who’s coming in, who’s going out.”
On Wednesday, Davis got a security survey of the church and its parking lot from the Greensboro Police Department.
It’s something the pastor had been planning to do for months but quickly moved on after nine people were shot and killed at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston last month.
“I felt deeply sorrowed and hurt and angry at the same time,” Davis said.
Those emotions ran deeper after fires broke out at more than half a dozen predominantly African-American churches throughout the south since the shooting.
At least three of those fires are being investigated as arson.
“During this year of 2015, during this time, you really do not expect that to happen,” he said.
Other churches like St. John AME in Gibsonville are also stepping up security, making sure male trustees are at the church whenever someone is in the building.
Officer Douglas Campbell with Greensboro police says there’s no increased threat to local churches but that all pastors should have an emergency safety plan.
“Come up with a plan and designate people ahead of time,” Campbell said. “Have a conversation to get those plans in place so they’re ready.”
