Pastors expect heightened security after shooting at South Carolina church

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (June 19, 2015) – Pastors are thinking twice about security after a recent shooting inside a South Carolina Church left nine people dead. Local pastors in Indianapolis say they expect to have a heightened sense of awareness going into their Sunday services.
“I think it’s devastating for parishioners, for congregants to go to church and not feel safe,” said Pastor Wayne Moore with Olivet Baptist Church.
Rev. Carey A. Grady knew one of the victims, Rev. Clementa Pinckney, and was upset to hear about the senseless act of violence that took his life. Rev. Grady spent fives years at Bethel AME Church in downtown Indianapolis. He called the tragedy a wake up call for everyone. Despite the shooting Rev. Grady doesn’t think people should bring guns to church.
“It’s one of the few places you can go to and no one ever thinks people are going to come on the property with a gun,” said Rev. Grady.
Rev. Charles Harrison at Barnes United Methodist Church said he neither encourages or discourages people from bringing guns to church.
“We have churches that have installed security cameras that are recording information, we have churches that have added doorkeepers, ushers, some have armed security as well to keep the people safe. It just depends on each church, some churches don’t have the capacity,” said Pastor James Jackson with Fervent Prayer Church.
