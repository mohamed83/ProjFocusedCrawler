 A South Carolina grand jury has indicted Dylann Roof on nine counts of murder for the massacre at Mother Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston last month. He was also charged with one count of weapons possession and three counts of attempted murder in connection with church members who survived the attack. 
 "My office cannot comment on the merits of the case," Solicitor Scarlett Wilson said in a statement announcing the indictments, which said he shot the victims with "malice aforethought." 
 Roof, 21, who is being held without bail, is also the subject of a federal hate-crime probe. All of his victims at the historically African-American church were black, and his friends have said he wanted to start a race war.
