The youngest victim to die in the tragic shooting at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C. shared a Snapchat video from the doomed bible study group in the moments before Dylann Storm Roof allegedly killed him and eight others.

In Tywanza Sanders's Snapchat video, which was obtained by Mashable and confirmed by four friends, a man is seen talking to the group seated around a large table covered with papers. Most of the participants at the bible study — and all of the victims — are black. But one man, seated at the far end of the table, is white.
Friends of Sanders say that man is Roof.

The bible study participants had welcomed the 21-year-old to sit with the group only to have him allegedly turn his gun on them after being there for an hour.
"I didn't notice until now that Dylann was just a few people away from Wanza," one friend told Mashable after showing us the clip. "You can slightly see him in the right corner of the screenshot."
Others tweeted their shock about the snap on Twitter.

You can actually see the white dude in Wanza last snap too smh

About Tywanza Sanders
Tywanza Sanders graduated in 2014 from Allen University.
Tywanza was a "quiet, well-known student who was committed to his education," Allen University Vice President of Institutional Advancement, Dr. Flavia Eldemire told Mashable. Eldemire added that Sanders, 26, had a "warm and helpful spirit."

“Our hearts and prayers are with the families of these two victims of this senseless act of violence," said Dr. Lady June Cole, interim president of Allen University.
But to friends remarking to his death on Twitter, "Wanza" is remembered as a "chill dude" who was overwhelmingly positive and who will leave a lasting impact. "He was literally a walking angel, always positive and uplifting," one said.
