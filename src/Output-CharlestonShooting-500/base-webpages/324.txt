MARYSVILLE —
Gina Johnson of Marysville tried to hold back tears as she explained that one of the nine people shot and killed Wednesday inside a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina, was her cousin, Clementa Pinckney.
“My cousin called and asked if I heard,” she said. “I said ‘I did but Clementa wasn’t there.’ He said ‘no, he was one of the ones that got killed.”
Johnson said Pinckney was the pastor of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, a senator and a father.
In Sacramento, 45 minutes south of Johnson’s home, an eery silence inside St. Andrew’s African Methodist Episcopal Church, the oldest black church west of the Mississippi, established in 1850.
Calls are already coming in from community members asking about a vigil, which will be held Friday.
At the state Capitol legislators took a moment of silence on Thursday.
Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson told FOX40 Thursday he is praying for the victims, their families and for the mayor of Charleston.
“If there is anything I can do, or we can do as mayors, then count us in,” Johnson said.
The NAACP released a statement Thursday that partly stated:
“We are outraged that 106 years later, we are faced today with another mass hate crime.”
The vigil will be held at 6 p.m., Friday at the AME Church located at 4151 Don Julio Boulevard in North Highlands.
