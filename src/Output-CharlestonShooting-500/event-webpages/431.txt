Police: Fatal south side shooting appears to be accidental


 


INDIANAPOLIS (May 5, 2015) – A woman was shot and killed on the south side of Indianapolis of Tuesday morning in what appeared to be an accident, police say.
It happened at Sherbrook Apartments in the 8000 block of McFarland Court. Dispatchers told FOX59 a man called 911 but isn’t considered a suspect in connection with the shooting.
IMPD said the woman died from what appeared to be an accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wound.
This is a developing story.
