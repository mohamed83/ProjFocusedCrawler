INDIANAPOLIS (July 9, 2015) – A man was taken to an Indianapolis hospital after a shooting involving police on the south side Thursday morning.

Police described him as suicidal.
Both Indianapolis Metropolitan police and the Johnson County Sheriff’s Department were on the scene, and witnesses reported hearing multiple gunshots.
