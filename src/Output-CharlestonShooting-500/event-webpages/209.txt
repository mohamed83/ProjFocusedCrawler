Dylann Roof, who gunned down nine people in a prayer meeting, has been captured by police.
The 21-year-old from Lexington, South Carolina, has been arrested after an intense manhunt by officers.
Dylann Roof was identified by his own uncle Carson Cowels, 56, who recognised him on CCTV footage released by police.
Cowels said his nephew had received a gun for his birthday in April. It’s not yet known if the .45 calibre pistol was the gun used in the attack.

Nine people – six women and three men were killed in the attack at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, which has strong historical links to the black community.
Church pastor Clementa Pinckney was among the victims, as was Cynthia Hurd, 54; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Sharonda Singleton, 45; Myra Thompson, 59; Ethel Lance, 70; Susie Jackson, 87; the Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; and DePayne Doctor, 49.
Before opening fire on the church congregation, Roof is thought to have said: ‘You rape our women and you’re taking over our country’.

Greg Mullen confirmed the arrest during a press conference. The Charleston Police Chief said: ‘This case could not have been cleared at quickly as it has been if not for all the investigation involved in the operation. I can’t say how grateful I am. Some of them have worked tirelessly.’
Mayor Joseph P Riley added: ‘We’ve had extraordinary cooperation. Because of all of that work, we can announce that that awful person – the terrible human being who went into a place of worship when they were playing would kill them – is in custody.’
Roof has been arrested twice previously a drugs charge and another for trespassing. It’s thought that he acted alone.
