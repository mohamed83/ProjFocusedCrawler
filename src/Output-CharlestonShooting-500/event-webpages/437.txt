Police: Attackers shoot 10 people at child’s birthday party in Detroit


 


DETROIT, Mich. (June 21, 2015) — Attackers fired semiautomatic weapons at a child’s birthday party in Detroit, killing one person and wounding nine others, authorities said.
A 20-year-old man died in the Saturday night shooting, CNN affiliate WXYZ reported.
Nine other people — three women and six men — suffered injuries, WXYZ said.
It’s a “miracle” no child was injured at the party, which was held at a basketball court, Detroit Assistant Police Chief Steve Dolunt told the affiliate.
About 400 people attended the party, but there are no leads so far, and witnesses are not cooperating, Dolunt said.
“There’s kids out here. I’m livid. … There’s not any excuse why no one is talking,” he told WXYZ. “Man up or woman up, whatever, and tell us what’s going on.”
Dolunt said police are looking for the owner of an abandoned red car found across the street whose occupants they believe were shot.
Authorities will continue their investigations Sunday.
