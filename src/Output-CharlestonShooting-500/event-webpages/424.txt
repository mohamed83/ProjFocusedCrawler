Its members met in secret in the years when black churches were outlawed here before the Civil War, and it contains a shrine to one of its founders, who helped organize a slave revolt in 1822.So the mass shooting that took the lives of nine churchgoers, including a state senator who was pastor, Clementa C. Pinckney, had a particularly deep resonance here in this genteel city, proud and mindful of its history but still torn by race and class.“Christ said to Peter, ‘Upon this rock I will build my church,’” said Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, the highest-ranking African-American in the House. He flew to Charleston on Thursday morning to attend a prayer vigil for the shooting victims.“Emanuel A.M.E. Church is the rock upon which the A.M.E. Church throughout the South is built,” Mr. Clyburn said. “That church has more historic significance to Charleston than any other church in this community.”Mourners placed ribbons outside Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., on Thursday.Brendan Smialowski / Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIntentionally or not, the gunman had found in Emanuel A.M.E., and in its 41-year-old pastor, rich symbols to attack with deadly racial hatred. Pastor Pinckney was a well-known civil rights leader in Charleston. He was elected to the South Carolina House at age 23, and then to the State Senate at age 27.After Walter Scott, an African-American, was shot in the back by a North Charleston police officer in April, Mr. Pinckney helped guide through the State Legislature a bill requiring officers to wear body cameras.Jaime Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party and a friend of Mr. Pinckney’s since their teenage years, said all the young Democrats coming up together in the state looked up to Mr. Pinckney. “We all aspired to be like Clementa,” Mr. Harrison said.Mr. Pinckney was not a divisive figure, community and political leaders say. State Representative James E. Smith Jr., the minority leader and a Democrat who was elected to the State House at the same time as Mr. Pinckney, called him, “a giant voice for justice in South Carolina,” and a conciliatory leader, not a bomb thrower.Interactive Feature | Violent History: Attacks on Black Churches  The killing of nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., is among a long list of attacks targeting predominantly black churches in the United States.Tyler Jones, political director of the South Carolina House Democratic Caucus, said, “I have never heard anyone utter a negative word about Clem Pinckney, and that’s not an exaggeration.”Mr. Smith, along with others, including Mr. Clyburn, saw the true target as the church itself.“It’s in the historic district,” Mr. Clyburn said. “It’s where people go when they’re touring the city. It’s right around where all the activity is. So he might have just stumbled upon the church — but I doubt it.”It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the church in the African-American South, said Edward Ball, author of “Slaves in the Family,” a history of Low Country South Carolina. Mr. Ball’s forefathers enslaved the forefathers of Emanuel A.M.E.’s leading parishioners.A black cloth and a single rose in a vase on Mr. Pinckney's desk at the statehouse on Thursday.Rainier Ehrhardt / Associated Press“This church is much more than a place where people sing gospel,” Mr. Ball said. “It’s tethered to the deep unconscious of the black community.”Charleston’s historic district has always been home to the city’s white elite, built on wealth generated by the slave trade and rice that was cultivated intensively with slave labor. Charleston was one of the richest cities in antebellum America, and old Charleston has long been known for its exclusivity.Many of the African-Americans who were able to remain in the historic district over the last century have been chased out more recently by gentrification and soaring property values.But Emanuel A.M.E. has remained firmly ensconced in what is known as the “Holy City,” a name inspired by all its church spires.With its prideful reminders of its legacy of rebellion, “Mother Emanuel,” as it is known by blacks here, is still “symbolically recognized by everyone as the thorn in the side of the white body — at the very center of town, the very center of white society,” Mr. Ball said.In 1822, the authorities were tipped off before plans for the slave revolt could be put in effect; 313 suspected conspirators were arrested, and 35, including Denmark Vesey, the organizer who was a founder of the church, were executed. Angry whites in town burned the original church down.The church, rebuilt in 1891, holds that history dear. A memorial to Mr. Vesey within its Gothic Revival walls is a reminder not only of the revolt, but also of Charleston’s past.In the 1960s, the church was a center of civil rights organizing. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the church in 1962.In his remarks on the killings on Thursday, President Obama acknowledged the church’s special history.“This is a place of worship that was founded by African-Americans seeking liberty,” he said. “This is a church that was burned to the ground because its worshipers worked to end slavery. When there were laws banning all-black church gatherings, they conducted services in secret. When there was a nonviolent movement to bring our country closer in line with our highest ideals, some of our brightest leaders spoke and led marches from this church’s steps.”He added, “This is a sacred place in the history of Charleston and in the history of America.”On Thursday, Emanuel was off limits, cordoned off from Charleston’s citizens with police tape and emergency vehicles. The city’s leaders and citizens gathered at Morris Brown A.M.E. Church, about a half-mile away, for the prayer vigil.The walk between the two churches along King Street leads past trendy galleries, new and trendy restaurants and bars, historical markers and the old American Theater, whose marquee read, “Pray for our Mother Emanuel AME Church.”Inside Morris, members of the clergy spoke effusively of unity and vowed not to let hate divide the city. Blacks, whites, Jews and Christians jammed the aisles, prayed and sang. A street minister, Mark Irvin, implored “all European-Americans, all non-African-Americans, whether you think your ancestors are innocent or guilty, bring yourselves to ask forgiveness from the Lord.”Bishop John Richard Bryant looked out on the multiracial, multiethnic throng from the pulpit and pronounced: “You look like what we in the Low Country call a quilt. You’re patches. You all fit somewhere.”But in front of the church, under a sweltering midday sun, after the clergy members had gone inside, an angrier group of young men took over. The memory of Walter Scott’s shooting is still fresh. They held handwritten poster boards declaring, “Black lives matter.”Terrence Meyers, 34, held one such sign at King and Morris streets as the crowd emptied out of Morris A.M.E., chased out by a bomb threat that seemed to underscore the angrier tone outside the church. He said that as dozens of police cars were screaming toward Emanuel A.M.E. on Wednesday night, he was pulled aside and ticketed by a policeman for riding his bicycle home from work on the sidewalk without a headlight.He was still furious the next day.“There’s no such thing as peace, not now,” he said. “Peace is over.”Jason Horowitz contributed reporting.ShareSaveRelated CoverageMany Ask, Why Not Call Church Shooting Terrorism?
