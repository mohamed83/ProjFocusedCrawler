Police search for shooters in two morning shootings


 


INDIANAPOLIS,Ind. (June 28, 2015)–Metropolitan police continue to look for two gunmen in separate shootings Sunday morning.
Shortly before 2 a.m. police were called to the 1400 block of Charing Cross Drive on the city’s south side on a report of a man shot in the head.  That scene is near Madison Avenue and East Thompson Road.
31-year-old Bradley R. Kelley was taken to Eskenazi Hospital in good condition.
Around 8:50 a.m. police and medics were called to the west side on a report of a person shot multiple times.
Police did not find anyone in the 600 block of Auburn Street.  According to investigators, that is where the shooting occurred but the victim then drove himself to the 5000 block of West Washington Street where police located him.
Police say the victim was shot at least twice in the hip area.  He was taken to Eskenazi Hospital.
Investigators searched the area but were unable to locate a suspect.
