        TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREWASHINGTON â€“  Members of Congress and their staffs, some overcome with emotion and grief, gathered outside the Capitol Thursday with the Senate chaplain to pray for the victims in the shooting at a Charleston church Wednesday night.The congressional prayer circle, arranged by Sen. Tim Scott's office, was one of many signs that the murder of nine churchgoers was shocking to everyone on Capitol Hill.Democrats and Republicans, House members and senators, embraced each other and offered condolences, especially to the South Carolina delegation."We need healing in this great land," said Senate Chaplain Barry Black. "I think our coming together in such a united and passionate way today can be the beginning of that healing."Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., quoted Scripture that God is near the broken-hearted."That would match South Carolina and all of us today," Lankford said. "Our hearts cannot believe a man would be so angry and venomous that he could sit in a church prayer circle and murder. I cannot even process that thought."Rep. Mark Sanford, R-Charleston, struggled for words to describe his city in the aftermath of what is being investigated as a hate crime."People are in shock, in disbelief. People can't make heads or tails of it," Sanford said near the steps of the Capitol.He said he knew state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, the pastor of Emanuel AME Church, for several years.THE GREENVILLE NEWSMore Upstate churches increasing security measuresTHE GREENVILLE NEWSSenate praises fallen comrade: "He was the best of us""You talk about a guy who walked and lived his faith, he did," Sanford said.Rep. Joe Wilson, R-Springdale, was born in Charleston and grew up there."It was like a 9/11 to me," Wilson said in an interview just off the House floor. "And then the horror to find out Sen. Pinckney was among those who were killed."The victims were attending a prayer service at a church with strong roots in the African-American community, and the alleged shooter was white and wore insignia affiliated with white supremacy.While there were many calls for prayer and peace, there was also a lot of talk about racism and hatred.Rep. James Clyburn, D-Columbia, asked people to teach their neighbors that hate is not the answer."I am distraught that this kind of hate still exists in our country and specifically in my home state of South Carolina," Clyburn said.House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said of the shooter, "Anyone who would do something so unspeakable is pure evil."Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-Seneca, said the incident has shaken everyone's sense of security."There are bad people in this world who are motivated by hate," Graham said."Every decent person has been victimized by the hateful, callous disregard for human life shown by the individual who perpetrated these horrible acts. "Scott, who rushed back to South Carolina Thursday morning, said: "While we unfortunately know that hate enters some people's hearts, I also know this: we can and will work every single day to replace hate with love, pain with kindness, and hostility with good will."
