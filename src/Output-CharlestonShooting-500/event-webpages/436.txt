INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (June 16, 2015) – A 19-year-old was killed inside his home early Tuesday morning. Relatives say someone kicked in the door and shot him.
When officers arrived on scene in the 3100 block of Cluster Pine Drive they found the teen dead inside the home. Police later identified the man as 19-year-old David W. Phelps.
“Just tell us who did it, that’s all we want to know,” said Ayanna Robinson, the victim’s cousin.
Family members say he graduated from Warren Central High School in 2014 and had dreams of becoming a chef one day. He was taking classes at Ivy Tech. During high school Phelps liked to play football and basketball.
They also tell FOX59 the teen’s mother and two other people were inside the home when the shooting happened.
Police say everyone who was inside at the time of the shooting was questioned as officers try to piece together what happened. The teen was the only person shot inside of that home. No one else was injured. There’s no word on a person of interest right now, but police say they do not believe it was a random act.
“This is not an incident in which someone just randomly and indiscriminately picks a location and terrorizes a home or family or citizen or people group. There are relationships here, people know one another here and that’s what we want to convey,” said IMPD Officer Chris Wilburn.
Following is a breakdown of murder victims under the age of 25:
 
Jan 1 – Jun 15, 2015         18 out of 48 (38%)
Jan 1 – Jun 15, 2014         27 out of 70 (39%)
Jan 1 – Dec 31, 2014        58 out of 138 (42%)
