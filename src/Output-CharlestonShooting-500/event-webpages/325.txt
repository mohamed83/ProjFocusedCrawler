                    What we know about the shooting at a Charleston church that left nine dead
                

                    Dylann Roof, 21, is the suspect in Wednesday’s massacre at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C. Police say the shooting was racially motivated, the most common type of hate crime.

                        Accused killer had previous police encounters
                    



                                Roof was captured by police in Shelby, N.C., after an all-night, all-morning manhunt.
                            

                                In April, he was arrested on charges of trespassing at the Columbiana Mall in Columbia, S.C. That came two months after he was banned from the mall after a police officer said he found Roof in possession of a narcotic there.

                        Roof published racist Web site before the massacre
                    



                                Roof's apparent Facebook profile photo carries a possible indicator of his racist worldview. The picture shows Roof wearing a jacket with at least two conspicuous patches depicting old flags of racist, white-minority regimes in southern Africa.
                            

                                Authorities said he left a racist manifesto targeting blacks, Jews and Hispanics on his Web site, a white supremacist broadside that also appears to offer a rationale for the shootings.
                            

                                Among the 60 photos on the Web site is one of Roof on a beach with the number 1488 written in the sand. According to the Anti-Defamation League, 14 and 88 are a combination of numeric symbols used by white supremacists. 
                            

                                There also are more provocative images, such as Roof wearing all black and standing on an African burial site, burning an American flag or holding a Confederate flag.

                        The shooting occurred at a historic African American church
                    








                                The historic church near Marion Square in downtown
                                Charleston was established in 1816 and is among the
                                oldest African American churches in the country. As the oldest African American congregation south of Baltimore, the church was a rallying point in the 1960s for Civil Rights leaders, who regularly visited the pulpit and led marches from the church steps.

                        Slaying happened during a Bible study session and is being investigated as a hate crime
                    





                                Survivors said the shooter sat in the back of the church for about an hour during a prayer service and Bible study. At around 9 p.m., he yelled racial epithets and began to methodically shoot the nine victims, including Pastor Clementa Pinckney. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said Roof was arrested during a traffic stop in Shelby, N.C., about 250 miles from Charleston.

                         The shooting took place on the southern edge of an area called the Neck, where many of Charleston’s black residents live
                    

                        Census tracts just to the north of the affluent downtown area that were almost exclusively black in 1990 have become more diverse. Tracts farther away from downtown, to the north and west, now have a higher percentage of  black residents.
