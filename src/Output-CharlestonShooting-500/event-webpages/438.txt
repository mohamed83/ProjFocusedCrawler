MUNCIE, Ind. (July 3, 2015)— Officers with the Muncie Police Department are investigating  the homicide of an 18-year-old man.
Christian Michael Orebaugh was fatally shot just before 11 p.m. Thursday at his house in the 200 block of West 23rd Street.
Muncie police say Orebaugh’s roommate was inside the house when authorities arrived, but that individual is not considered a suspect.
In the past,Orebaugh’s residence was a known drug house, according to Muncie Police–the motive for Thursday’s shooting is still unknown.
While the shooting is still under investigation, neighbors have their suspicious about the cameras that are posted near the front door of the home.
“It makes you wonder what was going on inside of the house at the time. If there are cameras you know they are up to something,” said neighbor Mitch Teal.
“There were several cars in and out of there late at night. It always made me wonder,” said neighbor Linda Rigel.
Orebaugh’s sister spoke to FOX59 about her brother, who was expecting a baby.She said he recently graduated Cowan High School.
An autopsy was performed on the teen Friday.


"He has a kid on the way, why would you take him? That baby can't have a dad now."–Christian's younger sister pic.twitter.com/Xm81YY9Ip4
