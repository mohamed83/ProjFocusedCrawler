9 dead in black church shooting that police call a hate crime; shooter at large

CHARLESTON, S.C. — A white gunman walked into a historic black church in Charleston and opened fire during a Bible study class, killing nine people Wednesday evening, police said.
The suspect was still at large early Thursday morning. And the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the oldest AME church in the South, is being investigated as a hate crime.
Police Chief Gregory Mullen said, “I do believe it’s a hate crime.”
“The only reason someone would walk into a church and shoot people that were praying is hate,” said Charleston Mayor Joe Riley.

Eight churchgoers died at the scene; a ninth at a hospital, police said.
Officials wouldn’t say how many people were at the prayer service during the shooting. There were survivors, said Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen, but he didn’t elaborate.
Historic significance
Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church has been a presence in Charleston since 1816 when African American members of Charleston’s Methodist Episcopal Church formed their own congregation after a dispute over burial grounds.
It was burned to the ground at one point, but rebuilt.
Every Wednesday evening, the church holds a Bible study in its basement.
The shooting was “obviously the most intolerable and unbelievable act possible,” the mayor said.
“People in prayer Wednesday evening. A ritual, a coming together, praying, worshiping God. An awful person come in and shoot them is inexplicable,” Riley said.
Police received the first call around 9:05 p.m. Officers arrived to find several victims inside
“It’s really bad. It’s a very bad scene,” local pastor Thomas Dixon said.
Search on for suspect
Police said the suspect in the shooting is a clean-shaven white man in his 20s, with a slender build. He was wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and boots.
“He obviously is extremely dangerous,” Chief Mullen said. “We will put all our resources, we will put all of our energy in finding this individual.”
The department asked anyone with information to call 911 dispatchers.
“While we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another,” South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said.
Heavy police presence
“Like everybody out here, we’re sick to our stomachs that this could happen in a church,” Rep. Dave Mack, a friend of the church’s pastor, told CNN affiliate WCSC.
Corey Wessenger, who was standing across the street from the church, said the area was swarming with law enforcement.
Community members gathered in a prayer circle just down the street from the scene.

Very sad an horribly tragic. This is one of those crimes among the lowest of low. I hope the person responsible dies a very slow and painful death, sooner than later.

What the person did was terrible. That said – the media, the race-baiters, progressives and many liberals will be relishing in this story. I’m sure Jackson and Sharpton are already warming up their private jets for an appearance.

Couldn’t you just post your grief instead of “you” suddenly turning into this baiting thing yourself

This is a tragedy! I’ve never understood the motivation behind all these wackos that feel the need to get some notoriety by killing others. I can’t help wondering how being detained and questioned will affect the life of that photographer who just happened to be wearing the wrong outfit!  It shouldn’t, but you know that tons of people will see him in handcuffs but not read far enough to see that he was released!  Here’s an interesting article about the pastor that was killed…
