The person above is NOT the suspect.  His name is Austin Rich, he was just wearing a similar looking outfit as the suspect.  He was questioned and released.  


So the guy that was taken in handcuffs was NOT the suspect. It was a local cameraman. #chsnews

And “his” name has been spelled three different ways that I’ve seen so far: Dylan, Dyllan, and this (most interesting) Dylann.  ANN?  He does look very effeminate. The small ankle in the large boots, and then the alleged comment about women being raped …
