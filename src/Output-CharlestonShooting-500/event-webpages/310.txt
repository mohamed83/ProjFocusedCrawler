Police vehicle hit after early morning police chase


 


INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (May 9, 2015) – An Indiana State Trooper’s vehicle was rear ended in traffic on the city’s south side early Saturday morning.
The backup started after police chased a stolen vehicle south on Binford Blvd. then onto I-65 south. Police say three suspects fled the vehicle at mile marker 106, just past the Keystone Ave. exit.
The officer was using his car to block the right two lanes of traffic when he was hit.
The officer was transported to the hospital as a precaution.
Troopers found and arrested all 3 suspects.
