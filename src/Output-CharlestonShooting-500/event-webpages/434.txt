INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (May 4, 2015) – Police are still looking for a suspect who shot a man during a fit of road rage. 41-year-old Nicholas Norris died from his injuries. He was shot multiple times and at least once in the head.
Detectives are talking with several witness to find out more information about the Sunday evening incident. The situation escalated when both men pulled into the parking lot of a pawn shop at E. Michigan Street and Rural.
Police said it started when an SUV cut off a motorcycle driven by Norris. Witnesses reported seeing both men continue to cut each other off and perform other illegal traffic maneuvers.
“There were some things throw outside of a window at the motorcyclist and at that point the driver or the occupant of the SUV got out of his car,” said Officer Chris Wilburn with IMPD.
When the men pulled into the pawn shop parking lot someone in the SUV pulled out a gun. Shots were fired and the vehicle took off.
Police believe most of the incident was captured on surveillance video. Detectives are looking at the video to put together a description of the SUV.
“From what we’ve been able to understand from detectives they’re pulling surveillance video from businesses and trying to really pinpoint exactly which vehicle was involved and the type of vehicle the make and model,” said Officer Wilburn.
A friend of the victim is offering a $1,000 cash reward for information leading to an arrest. Police ask anyone with info to call Crime Stoppers at 317-262-TIPS.
