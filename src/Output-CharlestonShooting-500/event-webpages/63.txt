DES MOINES, Iowa — In the wake of the tragic and horrific shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, a prayer gathering was held here in Des Moines at Faith Missionary Baptist Church Thursday.
It was an emotional meeting, as a group of about 20 people gathered to pray, talk, and listen to one another. Those in attendance discussed issues ranging from violence in our culture to the various different forms of racism in society. The people at the gathering say they take what happened in South Carolina personally, saying it could have happened here in this church.
Shock, anger, frustration, and an overwhelming sadness; that’s what youth minister Arnold Woods III says he feels about the shooting in Charleston. Woods III telling Channel 13 News, “One of the biggest reasons for sadness is because it happened at a church. Church is some place that you’re supposed to feel safe and welcome and not have to deal with thinking about violence or potentially being killed or hurt in any way.”
Social justice activist and organizer Avery Jackson that the prayer meeting and discussion was important to “Allow us to properly process our emotions after experiencing such a tragedy because it does take an emotional toll, especially on black people and all we’ve been seen in the media, and all the attacks on black bodies this year. We want to make sure that we provide a space where people can properly process and their existence can be affirmed.”
At the prayer gathering, deacons and elders spoke of the civil rights movement and struggles through the years. The youth spoke of what it means to see acts of racism covered in the social media age. And amid the discussion the local president of the NAACP even prayed for the soul of the perpetrator of the crime, saying his faith compels him to do so.
Arnold Woods Jr. telling Channel 13 News, “From a faith based perspective, as Christians…It’s our responsibility to pray for our enemies as well as our friends…we’re taught to hate the sin, but love the sinner.” Woods Jr. continued, saying, “God is all about love. That is Him. That is the essence of God from my perspective, so from my perspective we are always praying for those who would do all against us and we pray that they will turn from their wicked ways.”
