(CNN – May 11, 2015) — George Zimmerman — acquitted by a Florida jury over the death of Trayvon Martin — was involved in a shooting in Lake Mary, Florida, on Monday, police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett said.
Zimmerman apparently suffered a minor gunshot wound, CNN affiliate WESH-TV reported, citing the police chief.
The affiliate spoke with one witness, Ricardo Berrare, who also said Zimmerman’s injuries didn’t look serious.
“He walked normally into the ambulance, so he wasn’t being helped or nothing,” Berrare told WESH.
The shooting is under investigation, but it appeared to be some type of road rage incident, Gillett told CNN.
Police said there were no fatalities in the shooting and said the department would not release additional information until a briefing planned for Monday afternoon.
It is the latest headline-grabbing incident for Zimmerman since his acquittal in July 2013 on a murder charge in the death of Martin, a 17-year-old African-American.
Zimmerman fatally shot Martin on February 26, 2012.
On that day, Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain in Sanford, Florida, called 911 to report “a suspicious person” in the neighborhood.
He was instructed not to get out of his SUV or approach the person, but Zimmerman disregarded the instructions. Moments later, neighbors report hearing gunfire.
Zimmerman was pulled over for speeding in northern Texas in July 2013, a few weeks after he was acquitted of Martin’s death.
He apparently had a firearm in the glove compartment of a vehicle, prompting an officer to tell him, “Don’t play with your firearm, OK?”
He was sent on his way with a warning.
In November of that year, police took him into custody at his then-girlfriend’s home in Apopka, Florida, after an apparent fight.
He was arrested on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief, but the woman later asked that the charges be dropped and Zimmerman was not prosecuted.
In September 2014, police in Lake Mary said a man claimed Zimmerman threatened to kill him during a road rage incident. He wasn’t arrested in that incident.
Then, in January, he was arrested on another domestic violence complaint after he allegedly threw a wine bottle at a girlfriend, his lawyer Don West told reporters at the time. She later recanted and charges were never filed, CNN affiliate WESH reported.
