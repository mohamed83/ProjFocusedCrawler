HENRICO COUNTY, Va. -- A Virginia gospel musician's message to Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof is going viral on Facebook.


Years ago musician Marcus Stanley was shot eight times at point-blank range by a gang member, 
according to WTVR
. Stanley said he was left there to die.


He said his own story of survival is a testament to what he knows God can do.


Stanley told WTVR he believes God will bring healing to the families who lost loved ones in the Charleston shooting.


“Words cannot express how painful it is," Stanley said.  "My heart goes out to the families for the terrible act against their loved ones.”


Stanley said he decided to post a prayer on Roof's Facebook page in hopes it would reach the suspected killer.


In the post, Stanley encouraged the suspected shooter to try to make amends with God for his actions.


Give your heart to Jesus and confess your sins with a heart of forgiveness. He is the only one that can save your soul and forgive you for the terrible acts you’ve done. I love you Dylan, even in the midst of darkness and pain you’ve caused.


Marcus Stanley’s posts message on Dylan Roof’s Facebook page.


Stanley told WTVR he knew many people wouldn't understand his message to Roof but decided to post it anyway.


“Instead of attacking, I said let me reach out to him in love. He still has to face the consequences of the law and I’m not denying that, but what I was trying to do was save his soul,” Stanley said.


He said his near-death experience showed him the power of forgiveness.


“I don’t expect the people affected by this tragedy to act like everything’s perfect. It’s a process," Stanley said.


"There will be tears and there will be laughs and good memories. It’s a healing process. It took me six years to forgive the shooter who shot me.”


He said he hopes the Charleston community will hold to its faith and cling to each other with love.
