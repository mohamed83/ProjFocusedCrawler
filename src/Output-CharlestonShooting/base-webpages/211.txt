Charleston evokes memories of Birmingham

For some, the shooting evoked memories of the 1963 Birmingham bombing, in which Ku Klux Klan members planted dynamite on the steps of the 16th Sreet Baptist Church, 
killing four African American girls
.


“The appalling events at the Emanuel Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston sent shudders through those who spent decades working to hold the Birmingham church bombers accountable,” Doug Jones, the former U.S. attorney who prosecuted Klan members who carried out the bombing, said in a statement Thursday. “For such a heinous act to be perpetrated in a house of God more than a half a century after the 16th Street tragedy is a reminder to us all that we must be ever vigilant and work as one community to call out and eliminate racial hatred. “

How black church leaders are responding

Black church leaders far from South Carolina responded to Wednesday’s fatal shooting in Charleston with grief, prayer and calls of action. 
From Acts of Faith
:


From church leaders to political leaders, the mass shootings at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church pricked the hearts of many in one of oldest and most prominent church denominations in the country.


“The AME church has a real strong connective bond across the country,” said Dakarai Aaron, a member of the Board of Stewards at Metropolitan AME church in Washington DC. “When one of us hurts all of us hurt.”

Meet the florist who says she spotted Dylann Roof

6:25 PM
 
 
 
SHELBY, N.C. — Debbie Dills says she was going to work on Thursday morning when she pulled up next to a car and saw something that caught her eye.


His hair caught her eye, she said later, but she continued driving and pulled off of Interstate 74 to continue on to her job as a florist at Frady’s Florist in Kings Mountain. But she decided she had to do something.


That hair, and that car, had been all over the news in the hours before Dills got into her car. Police had released photos of Dylann Roof and said he had opened fire inside a Charleston, S.C., church, gunning down nine parishioners gathered in the building.


“Those people were doing what I had just done,” Dills said in an interview Thursday. She was at her church, the West Cramerton Baptist Church in Gastonia, on Wednesday night. “They were studying his word, that is what they were there to do, and they lost their lives doing that.”


(Ken Otterbourg for The Washington Post)


Dills called her boss Todd Frady, and got back on the road, driving about 10 miles down I-74 before catching up to him. She and Frady eventually got onto a three-way phone call with the Shelby Police Department, she said, and she got close enough to the car to get the tag number.


A short time later, Dills said, the police told her they had the situation under control, and she turned around to go to work.


Before Dills got back to work, though, Frady called her to tell her the news: Police had arrested Roof in Shelby.


The Shelby Police Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Thursday. But when Gregory Mullen, the Charleston police chief, announced the arrest on Thursday morning, he pointed to one tip in particular, saying that Roof was captured after a citizen saw something suspicious and called the police.

Rev. Pinckney's powerful speech on racism
 
 
 
Elahe Izadi

June 18, 
6:16 PM
 
 
 


Weeks before being gunned down at Emmanuel AME Church, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney took to the South Carolina Senate floor to address racism and violence. His remarks, which addressed the police shooting of Walter Scott, were made in support of equipping police officers with body cameras,
 our colleague Max Ehrenfreund writes
:


“Today the nation looks at South Carolina and is looking at us to see if we will rise to be the body and to be the state that we really say that we are,” Pinckney said, citing “a real heartache and a yearning for justice, for people not just in the African American community, but for all people — and not just in the Charleston area or even in South Carolina, but across our country.”


Pinckney went on to suggest that his faith requires forgiveness, even of those who kill.


“The Lord teaches us to love all, and we pray that over time, justice will be done,” he said.

Confederate flag flies at S.C. statehouse grounds

The United States and South Carolina flags atop the statehouse in Columbia have been lowered Thursday after the shooting at Emanuel AME. But a Confederate flag on the statehouse grounds remains raised at full mast, the Post and Courier reported.


Officials
 told the Post and Courier
 that the state legislature controls when it comes down. 
From the paper
:


State law reads, in part, the state “shall ensure that the flags authorized above shall be placed at all times as directed in this section and shall replace the flags at appropriate intervals as may be necessary due to wear.”


The protection was added by supporters of the flag to keep it on display as an officially recognized memorial to South Carolinians who fought in the Civil War. Opponents say it defends a system that supported slavery and represents hate groups.


In a show of respect, a brief recognition ceremony was held in the Senate chamber Thursday. The U.S. and South Carolina flags were lowered from the dome. The square Confederate banner that’s in front of the building and on display at the Confederate monument was left alone.


As Will Whitson, South Carolina state reporter for NBC affiliate WIS-TV 
explained
, removing the flag requires a legislative vote and “it is not an instantaneous process.”


The flag is part of a Confederate War Memorial, and is not on a pulley system, so it cannot be lowered, only removed.

Writes Yates
:


Nearly three years ago, I was sitting in Joseph P. Riley Jr. Park watching the Charleston RiverDogs play baseball. I was on a tour to visit minor league parks and the second largest city in South Carolina was the furthest point south. I did all the tourist things, visiting the historic district, where the ugly details of the state’s slave past is conveniently white-washed with phrases that make everyone feel like it was all okay.


One tour guide called an old trading block downtown “the Internet of its era” and others would routinely throw around the phrase “most prosperous” or “most profitable” colony, as if there was a reason that farmers were making money beyond, you know, atrocious human rights activities that allowed them to enrich themselves on the backs of others. I visited seven cities that summer all across the American South.


Charleston was the only place I felt physically uncomfortable just walking around, because the visual vocabulary of the place was so painfully unchanged from one of the most awful chapters of American history.

The last U.S. religious site with major bloodshed

Three years ago, before the gunfire erupted at a Sunday morning service, members of the close-knit Sikh community in suburban Milwaukee seldom locked the temple doors.


Now, those who arrive this evening to pray for the victims in Charleston, S.C. must ring a buzzer for a full-time security guard to let them inside, Danielle Paquette reports. This is life for the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin after a gunman killed five men and one woman in 2012, the last major bloodshed at a place of worship in the United States before the deadly church shooting in Charleston, S.C.


“It used to be in the Sikh religion, all doors stayed open,” Balhair S. Dulai, vice president of the temple. “But what happened here, and what happened in South Carolina — these things could happen anywhere. No one is immune.”

In April, Dylann Roof was arrested on charges of trespassing at the Columbiana Mall in Columbia, S.C. That came two months after he was banned from the mall after a police officer said he found Roof in possession of a narcotic there.


Here are the police reports from those two incidents.


In this report from February, police in Columbia, S.C., say that Roof was acting suspicious at a mall north…

One of the victims of the Charleston church shooting was a recent college graduate, the university where he studied confirmed Thursday.


Tywanza Sanders, a 2014 graduate of the 
Division of Business Administration
 at Allen University, was among those killed in the shooting, the institution said in a news release.


“He was a quiet, well known student who was committed to his education,” the statement read. “He presented a warm and helpful spirit as he interacted with his colleagues. Mr. Sanders was participating in the Bible Study session at Mother Emanuel church at the time of the shooting.”

5 facts about violence at U.S. houses of worship

From 
Acts of Faith’s Sarah Pulliam Bailey
 comes five key points to know about violence at houses of worship in the United States:




This incident ties for the largest mass murder at a house of worship in the United States.


There is an uptick in violence at houses of worship. In 2014, there were 176 deaths at a religious institution.


There have been 13 mass murders at a house of worship since the Birmingham, Ala., bombing in 1963.


About 60 percent of violence at religious institutions include guns.


The last mass killing at a house of worship was at a Sikh temple outside Milwaukee in 2012.




Bailey writes:


The Charleston shooting ties for the most people killed during a mass murder at a faith-based institution in recent memory, according to Carl Chinn, who runs what is considered to be the most extensive database on church violence. The FBI defines mass murder as four or more killed in a single act, typically at one location.


“It’s certainly one of, if not the most, vicious attacks I’ve seen at a faith-based organization,” said Chinn, who described the shooting as the 13th mass murder at a faith-based organization in the country.

Lawmakers and aides assembled outside of the U.S. Capitol steps Thursday morning for a prayer circle led by Senate Chaplain Barry Black.


“A church should be one of the safest places on the planet. And people assembled to lift their heads in prayer to hear the word of God. And they were brutally murdered in the house of God,” 
Black said
. “Our hearts ache for the families of the victims. Our hearts ache for the citizens of Charleston, South Carolina. Our hearts ache for our nation, and we pray and ask that God would somehow use us to end the insanity of violence that we see.”

Biden: 'Hate has once again been let loose'

Vice President Biden, who had seen one of the victims of the Charleston shooting less than a year ago, called it an “act of pure evil and hatred.”


“Hate has once again been let loose in an American community,” Biden and his wife, Jill, said in a statement Thursday. “And the senseless actions of a coward have once again cut short so many lives with so much promise.”


Biden said that they last saw 
the Rev. Clementa Pinckney
, who was also a state senator, last year at a prayer breakfast in Columbia, S.C.


“He was a good man, a man of faith, a man of service who carried forward Mother Emanuel’s legacy as a sacred place promoting freedom, equality, and justice for all,” Biden said. “We pray for him and his sister as we do for the seven other innocent souls who entered that storied church for their weekly Bible study seeking nothing more than humble guidance for the full lives ahead of them.”
