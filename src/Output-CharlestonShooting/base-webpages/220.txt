ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – President Obama announced Monday that he is banning the federal provision of certain types of military style equipment to local police departments. This decision comes after a task force that the President put in place in January decided that police departments should be barred from getting and using any federal funds for tracked armored vehicles, high caliber firearms and ammunition and camouflage uniforms.


This is one step in the President’s plan to try and ease any tensions between police and minority communities in the wake of Ferguson.


St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar was off on Monday and unavailable for comment, but former chief Tim Fitch did weigh in on the Presidents announcement saying that he was misleading the American people.


Fitch says, “None of the equipment used in Ferguson was anything that the President was talking about, none of it was military surplus equipment so to use Ferguson as an example of militarization of police is just wrong, not accurate.”


The task force used part of U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill’s Protecting Police and Communities Act to reform law enforcement agencies and the federal dollars they get, she says, “this is a step in the right direction to help protect police and the residents they serve in their communities.
