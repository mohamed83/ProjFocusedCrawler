CHARLESTON, SC (WCSC) -
            
The NAACP has released a statement citing their "outrage" over Wednesday night's shooting at Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston that left nine people dead. 
Wednesday's fatal shooting occurred around 9 p.m. at Emanuel AME Church, located at 110 Calhoun Street, after police say a young white man opened fire on parishioners, killing nine and leaving three survivors. 
Among the dead was South Carolina Senator and Emanuel AME Pastor Clementa Pinckney, according to Elder James Johnson with the National News Network. 
NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks released the following statement detailing his outrage over the shooting, and condolences for the victims: 
"The NAACP was founded to fight against racial hatred, and we are outraged that 106 years later, we are faced today with another mass hate crime. Our heartfelt prayers and soul-deep condolences go out to the families and community of the victims at Charleston's historic Emanuel AME Church. The senselessly slain parishioners were in a church for Wednesday night bible study. There is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people engaged in the study of scripture. Today, I mourn as an AME minister, as a student and teacher of scripture, as well as a member of the NAACP.
The NAACP South Carolina State Conference and Charleston Branch have been working on the ground with police and the community to bring this case to a close. We remain vigilant while the local police and FBI investigate this hate crime and bring the shooter to justice
."
Authorities are searching for the suspect, who fled the scene following the mass shooting. 
The Charleston County Coroner's Office has not yet identified the other victims in the attack.
