WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. — The cousin of a minister who was among the nine people killed Wednesday in Charleston, S.C., says his family is devastated by the death.


Ward Miller of Winston-Salem said he learned about the death of his cousin, the Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., at 5 a.m. Thursday. Simmons, 74, was the associate minister at Emmanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, Miller said.


“We were like brothers,” Miller said of Simmons. “We were very close. This massacre will be part of my family’s life forever.”
