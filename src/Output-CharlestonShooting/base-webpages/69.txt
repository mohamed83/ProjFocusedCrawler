HIGH POINT, N.C. -- Churches around the country have been holding prayer vigils in the wake of last Wednesday’s shooting massacre where nine people were killed during bible study in Charleston.


Pastor Kinston Jones, of St. Stephen Metropolitan AME Zion Church, says along with spiritual support, his church is also trying to help show financial support to the victims’ families.


Since the shooting, Jones has been organizing a worship service where he is inviting all churches in High Point.


Money raised through the collection will go towards the victims' families.


Jones is also starting a special Sunday offering to add to the fund.


"Money will not be able to take away the pain,” Jones said. “But if the families know that they have support, spiritual support and brothers and sisters that will be there for them after the burial of loved ones, I think it can certainly encourage them and help to know that someone is in the fight with them."


The worship service entitled Unity in the Community will be held at St. Stephen at 6 p.m. June 30.


All proceeds will go towards the Charleston, S.C., Mother Emmanuel AME Church Hope Fund.
