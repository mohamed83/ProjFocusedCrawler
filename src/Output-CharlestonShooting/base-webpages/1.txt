CHARLESTON, S.C. --
 Police were searching for a suspect after a gunman opened fire Wednesday night at a church in downtown Charleston, 
CBS affiliate WCSC-TV reported
.
Charleston police spokesman Charles Francis said the shooting took place around 9 p.m. at the Emanuel AME Church on Calhoun Street, as a meeting was taking place.
Nine people died in the shooting, authorities say.
Charleston PD Chief Greg Mullen said, "I do believe it was a hate crime."
A few hours after the shooting, authorities began clearing the area after a bomb threat was called in to police dispatchers.
An Associated Press reporter on the scene says police helicopters with searchlights circled overhead in the area, as a group of pastors prayed across the street.
Francis described the suspect as a clean-shaven white male with a slim build, approximately 21 years old, who was wearing a gray sweatshirt, jeans, and boots.
The Emmanuel AME church is a historic African-American church that traces its roots to 1816, when several churches split from Charleston's Methodist Episcopal church.	
One of its founders, Denmark Vesey, tried to organize a slave revolt in 1822. He was caught, and white landowners had his church burned in revenge. Parishioners worshiped underground until after the Civil War.
This is a developing story.
