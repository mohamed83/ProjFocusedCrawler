Vigil held for Charleston victims at Omaha AME church






By: Melissa Fry,

OMAHA, Neb. - 


There's an effort in Omaha Thursday to take pain and turn it into prayer as the Charleston, South Carolina victims are remembered.
Video: Omaha AME church holds vigil for Charleston victims
Individuals hold hands in prayer at the Leads Bethel African Methodist Episcopal church near 24th and Franklin Streets.
Pastor Victoria Parker led the service to participants to deliver a message about the massacre and the man behind the gun.
“To sit in that presence and still commit the crime, we have to pray for him,” Parker said.
“How we respond to these acts of violence are essential to how we can begin to heal,” contributor Malachi Black said.
Taking time to process and heal from what some consider a hate crime.
“Why did he choose that church? Why choose predominately African American church? We don't know,” presiding elder the Rev. Benjamin Finnell said.
Finnell leads the AME Omaha District. He also leads Allen Chapel near 30th and Monroe streets. He said just as violence is evil, so is racism. It’s a sign of weakness in society that the power of prayer can overcome.
“To me it’s a saddening statement as to the moral and spiritual condition of our nation at this time,” Finnell said.
