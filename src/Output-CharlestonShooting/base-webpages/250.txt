ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – The attorney for the Ball-Bey family took the media on a tour of the home he says Mansur ran from last week.  Police shot and killed the 18-year-old after he ran from the back of the building. They say he pointed a gun at them just before he was shot to death. Police were serving a search warrant when Ball-Bey ran from the home.


The attorney says the narrative by the police doesn’t match reality.  He says it isn’t possible for the teen to run two doors down before the shooting.


St. Louis police investigators were also along for the tour.  They say their investigation into the shooting was still ongoing.


The St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office is also conducting a parallel investigation into the officer involved shooting.
