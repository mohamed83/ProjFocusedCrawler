Baltimore police, witnesses differ on story of man’s arrest

BALTIMORE (AP) – Baltimore police say they have arrested a man on a handgun charge near the scene of recent rioting over the death of a man fatally injured in officers’ custody.


Police tweeted Monday that reports that the man was shot were not accurate.


Live television coverage and photos tweeted from the scene showed medics putting a man in an ambulance and a large police presence, with officers lining up to apparently block one street.


The activity is taking place in the Penn North neighborhood, where police first spotted Freddie Gray on April 12. He was arrested and fatally injured in police custody. Six officers were charged Friday in Gray’s death.
