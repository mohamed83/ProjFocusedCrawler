CLEVELAND – After a lengthy explanation, an Ohio judge found Officer Michael Brelo not guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the shooting deaths of two people in Cleveland in 2012 following a police pursuit.


WJW-TV reports
 that Cuyahoga County Judge John O’Donnell made the announcement Saturday morning. Brelo was also found not guilty of felonious assault in the case.


Brelo, who is white, was charged with two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30, both of whom are black. Both were unarmed at the time of  the shooting.

Closing arguments
 in the month-long trial were presented on May 5..


On Nov. 29, 2012, a Cleveland Police officer thought he heard a gunshot while he was outside of his cruiser near the Cuyahoga County Justice Center, and pursued a blue car. The resulting police chase lasted 22 minutes, and involved more than 60 police cars and more than a hundred officers.


The chase ended at a high school parking lot, where numerous officers fired a total of 137 shots at Russell’s 1979 Chevrolet Malibu. Investigators from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation said 49 of those shots came from Officer Brelo’s Glock 17. His final 15 shots were fired from the hood of the suspect’s car.
