What happened:
 A gunman sat with a Bible group for about an hour Wednesday evening at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., before 
pulling out a weapon and firing
, reportedly reloading several times. Nine people are dead.
The suspect
: FBI identified 
Dylann Storm Roof
, 21, as the suspect in the shooting. Roof was captured Thursday on Highway 74 in Shelby, N.C., 245 miles northwest of Charleston. He was on the run for about 14 hours. The suspect waived extradition from North Carolina and was taken to a waiting police car wearing a bulletproof vest, with shackles on his feet and his hands cuffed behind his back. Roof also waived his right to counsel, meaning he will either represent himself or hire his own lawyer.

Roof's Facebook page hints at a racist outlook. He drove a car with a Confederate flag front plate, wore a jacket with the patches of apartheid South Africa and the formerly white-ruled African country of Rhodesia, and hung with the outcasts in high school. Lexington County, S.C., court records show Roof was arrested on March 2 on criminal possession of a controlled substance, and he was also jailed on April 26 on a trespassing charge.

The investigation
: In Washington, the Justice Department said its Civil Rights Division, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina are opening a hate crime investigation into the shooting.
The church
: Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the south, and is called "Mother Emanuel." Its 
rich history
 includes ties to a slave rebellion, Booker T. Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Vigils
: Two churches in South Carolina holding prayer vigils 
were evacuated Thursday because of bomb threats
. About 400 people in Greenville moved out of the West End Community Center for about 45 minutes when a threatening call came into the city's non-emergency line. In Charleston, a vigil at Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church also was evacuated because of a bomb threat.
