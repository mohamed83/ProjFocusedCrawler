KING’S MOUNTAIN, N.C. – The quick-thinking of one North Carolina woman helped police catch a man accused of killing nine people at a South Carolina church.


Debbie Dills got a bad feeling when she was driving into work Thursday morning.


Just after 10 a.m., something caught her eye as she was driving on Highway 74 near Shelby.


“I saw the back of his head,” Dills said. “And I saw that bowl cut, that hair.”


She called her boss at Frady’s Florist in Kings Mountain, about 15 miles outside Shelby.


“I think that I have just passed the car the boy was driving that killed the people in Charleston,” Dills remembered telling her boss.


Around 10:45 a.m., Shelby police caught and arrested 21-year-old Dylann Roof, accused of shooting and killing nine people at a Charleston church during Bible study Wednesday night.


“Once we got him in custody, we brought him here,” said Shelby Police Chief Jeff Ledford. “We notified Charleston to let them know we had their suspect.”


Dills said she had been thinking of the nine victims when she decided to call her boss and notify police.


“They were studying His word,” Dills said. “That’s what they were there to do and they lost their life doing that.”


“They can never come back,” Dills said. “But those families can find some kind of solace, some kind of peace and some kind of comfort in knowing that the young man is caught.”


Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten identified the nine shooting victims as follows: Cynthia Hurd, 54; Susie Jackson, 87; Ethel Lance, 70; Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Hon. Rev. Clementa Pinckney, 41; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; Rev. Sharonda Singleton, 45; Myra Thompson, 59.
