ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – A new witness came forward Wednesday with another side to a controversial St. Louis Police shooting.


A St. Louis Police Officer shot Jennifer Morgan-Tyra, 39, multiple times Friday, at her brother’s home in the 4200 block of Chippewa in South St. Louis during a domestic disturbance.


Morgan-Tyra is the wife of a St. Louis City Sheriff’s Deputy.


Her family is outraged.


Karla Nicholson, who was at the center of the disturbance, spoke with FOX 2 in an exclusive interview.


“I was sitting on the bed and she’s standing here and they’re back here by the kitchen yelling, ‘drop it, drop it’,” Nicholson said, recalling the details of the shooting.


She said she was the woman Morgan-Tyra’s family has referred to as the ‘intruder’ in the incident.


Morgan-Tyra certainly pointed a gun at Nicholson.


Nicholson said Morgan-Tyra’s family looked at her as a bad influence on Morgan-Tyra’s brother, Mike, who lives at the home and still deals with a traumatic brain injury suffered 7 years ago.


Mike Morgan said he called his sister to help him get Nicholson out of his house.


But both Nicholson and police said Nicholson was no intruder.  She was a frequent overnight guest; Mike Morgan had even given her own key, they said.


Also Mike Morgan told FOX 2 he tried to take the gun away from his sister to protect Nicholson before police arrived but his sister refused to drop it.


Nicholson said both women called 911 and that she was on the phone with police throughout the incident.  There should be an audio recording, she said.


“I heard ‘drop the gun, drop the gun’.  I just heard it repeatedly, 3-4 times.  She didn’t do it, the next thing you know ‘pop, pop, pop’,” Nicholson said, referring to the shots fired.


Morgan-Tyra’s family members said she remained on life-support Wednesday with 11 bullet wounds.


She never pointed the gun at police, they said, even though she faces felony charges for allegedly doing just that.


“I want the truth.  I can’t believe they shot my sister up with all those bullet holes.  Now they’re going to try to sweep it under the carpet,” said Morgan-Tyra’s sister, Rebecca Morgan.  “She would have never pointed a gun at an officer.  She just didn’t drop that gun fast enough.”


But she wasn’t in the room when it happened.


Nicholson was.  Though she thought police did the right thing, she wanted the Morgan family to know how heartsick she was and that she was praying for Jennifer.


“I feel like police were in for their lives…I just want to tell (the Morgan) family that I’m sorry for Jennifer getting hurt,” Nicholson said, breaking into tears.


She also said she was not armed with a screwdriver as earlier reported.


Though Morgan-Tyra pointed a gun at her, she never pointed the gun at police, Nicholson said.
