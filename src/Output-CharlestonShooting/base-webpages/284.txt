ST. CHARELS COUNTY, MO (KTVI) – When St. Charles County Police respond to domestic crimes, sometimes children can be frightened of officers, particularly if a parent is arrested. But starting this week officers began carrying backpack comfort items in their squad cars, filled with age appropriate items from infants to teenagers to help comfort them in a time of crisis.
