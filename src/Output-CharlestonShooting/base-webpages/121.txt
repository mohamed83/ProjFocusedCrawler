Lets hope this is not the start of more violence started by the agenda driven administration.

Sketchy details, but possibly 8 people deceased.  In Charleston SC there is a MASSIVE response, including confirmation of FBI, to a mass casualty shooting event being described as taking place in a church.    Initial ground reports are the LEO response units are severely distressed at what has been found so far.

Talk Wisdom
Talk Wisdom's goal is to defend the tenets and values of Biblical Christian faith. We defend our Constitutional Republic and Charters of Freedom, especially when speaking out against destructive social and political issues. As followers of our Savior and Lord, we should boldly stand up for Jesus Christ in our present circumstances. He is our Savior, Lord, and King, and His love needs to be shed abroad in our hearts and in our world - now.
Calder's Updates
Nigel Calder takes the pulse of science, as the author of Magic Universe and Einstein's Universe. He checks predictions of the past half-century, to see how they worked out. And his hand is on the brow of frenzied climatology, as a co-author of The Chilling Stars: A Cosmic View of Climate Change.
