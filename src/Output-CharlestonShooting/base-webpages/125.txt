A message from President Glenn McConnell:


Dear Campus Community:


CofC and Charleston County librarian Cynthia Hurd.


The tragedy at Emanuel A.M.E. Church hits painfully close to home. Among the victims of the horrific acts of Wednesday night was one of our own. Cynthia Hurd was a beloved and valued member of our College family.


In addition to her full-time job as regional manager of Charleston County’s St. Andrews Regional Library, Cynthia also worked at the College’s Addlestone Library as a part-time librarian. She was our longest-serving part-time librarian, having been at the College since the 1990s, when our library was still housed in the Robert Scott Small Building.


It is an understatement to say that Cynthia was dependable and an irreplaceable asset to our campus and to the countless library patrons she assisted over the years. She was a protector and lover of books and a fountain of knowledge whose loss will be felt by our entire College community.


Cynthia worked tirelessly to serve and improve her beloved city and its people. She was an advocate for education and life-long learning. Prior to becoming manager of the St. Andrews branch, Cynthia was a branch manager of John L. Dart Branch Library from 1990 to 2011.


Known for her quick wit and sense of humor, Cynthia connected with every person with whom she came in contact. She could relate to anyone, no matter who they were or where they came from. In that sense, she represented the very best of our College and our beloved Charleston.


On behalf of our entire College community across the world, I extend condolences to Cynthia’s family and loved ones and to the families and friends of all nine victims of this senseless act.


The College’s counseling staff stands ready to assist any member of the campus community in need. Please contact them at 843.953.5640. In addition, our Religious Life Council, which is a volunteer group of faith advisers representing 17 religious denominations, can also offer assistance. A council representative can be reached at 740.405.5043.


Together, we will move forward from this tragedy, and we will continue to serve our students and our campus community, just as Cynthia always did. But we move forward knowing that we are a lesser place today and forever because of this profound loss of life.


Sincerely yours,


Glenn F. McConnell ’69
