Man accused of Ferguson shooting again heads to court






 






CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) _ A man accused of shooting two police officers during a Ferguson demonstration is scheduled for another court appearance.


Twenty-year-old Jeffrey L. Williams is to be in a St. Louis County circuit courtroom on Tuesday on charges of felony assault, armed criminal action and a weapons offense.


Williams is accused of wounding the officers on March 12, during an early-morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson’s police chief. Both officers survived.


Prosecutors say Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else. Williams’ attorney has countered that Williams was beaten by police into wrongly confessing.


During Williams’ last court appearance, a judge refused to reduce Williams’ $300,000 cash bond to one that would require him to pay only $10,000.
