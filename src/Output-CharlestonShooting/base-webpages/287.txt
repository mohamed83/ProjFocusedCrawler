AFFTON, MO (KTVI) – There never was a missing baby. That’s the story from investigators with the St. Louis County Police Department, who spent Thursday afternoon and evening scouring an Affton neighborhood looking for clues after receiving a phone call from a woman that her baby had disappeared.


According to Sgt. Brian Schellman, a county police spokesman, police responded to a home in the 7100 block of Valbrook and remained at the home for several hours.


The woman who made the call was placed in an Affton fire vehicle and driven away from the scene.  Family members were led to the side of the home.  Some were seen crying as the woman was taken out of the home by police in handcuffs. She was not arrested, Schellman said, but taken to a local hospital for a medical evaluation.


After an exhaustive investigation, police believe that a crime was never even committed. Schellman said investigators heard conflicting stories from family members and other witnesses.


Schellman said authorities are ultimately pleased that nothing happened.
