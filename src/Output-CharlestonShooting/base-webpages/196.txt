The man allegedly behind a mass shooting at a Charleston church has returned to the city where the crime happened, after being apprehended in Shelby, North Carolina.
Dylann Roof, 21, was booked into Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center around 7:30 p.m.. Thursday, less than 24 hours after he allegedly killed nine people at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. He will be held in protective custody, away from the general population. Charleston P.D. says a bond hearing is pending.

Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said a citizen in Shelby tipped off authorities of a car that fit the description that Roof drove. Debbie Dills, a florist was on her way to work in Kings Mountain Thursday morning when she spotted who she believed was the suspect driving on Highway 74.
Shelby police stopped the car around 11:15 a.m. and took Roof into custody on the highway near Plato Lee Road in west Shelby. Police say Roof was cooperative with the officer when he was arrested. When police arrived to their traffic stop on Highway 74, Mullen said, "they realized it was the individual they were looking for."

Roof was left the Shelby Police Department around 3:45 p.m. Thursday and was taken to the Cleveland County courthouse. He faced a judge and waived extradition. Around 6:20 Thursday, Roof was boarded onto a plane that's registered to the State of South Carolina.
Police and the FBI on identified the Columbia man as the suspect in the killings at the historic black church early in the morning. Asked if authorities believe Roof had acted alone in his alleged attack, Mullen said "we don't have any reason to believe anyone else was involved."
Roof was the object of an intense manhunt after police issued surveillance photos of the suspect taken outside the S.C., which left nine people dead, and, within hours, released his name and photograph.

Florist led Shelby Police to Charleston shooting suspect
NBC Charlotte learned Roof was in south Charlotte earlier Thursday morning, before he was positively identified.
An employee at the Shell gas station at the intersection of Providence Road and Ballantyne Commons told NBC Charlotte that Roof came into the gas station around 6 a.m. There are multiple reports Roof used an ATM before getting into his car.

Pastor, state senator among the dead in mass shooting
The police chief said the tragedy had "touched the heart and soul of every person in this community" and thanked the "unparalleled cooperation" of all agencies involved.
Charleston Mayor Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley said the arrest of this "awful man" would begin the "necessary process of our healing together."
President Obama addressed the nation, expressing sorrow for the tragedy at "a sacred place in the history of Charleston, the history of America." Obama, who said he knew one of the victims, pastor and state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, said the country must eventually address the issue of gun violence.
"I've had to make statement like this too many times," Obama said, adding "People were killed because someone who wanted to do harm had no trouble getting a gun."
Dylann Roof was arrested in Shelby on Thursday.

A Facebook page for a Dylann Roof' carries a photo of a young man in a bowl-like haircut similar to the image in a surveillance photo outside the Emanuel AME church just before the killings Wednesday night. The page says he attended White Knoll High School in Lexington.
The Facebook page also carries a photo of Roof standing in in front of a swamp forest wearing a jacket with patches of the racist-era flags of South Africa and Rhodesia, the one white-ruled country now called Zimbabwe.
Lexington County, S.C. court records show Roof was arrested on March 2 on criminal possession of a controlled substance. The records indicate it may be a first offense. The case is pending. He was also jailed on April 26 on a trespassing charge.
Police, beefed up by additional FBI agents flown in from Washington, appealed to the public Thursday for tips on the whereabouts the suspect, described as a lone white gunman.
The suspect's uncle, Carson Cowles, 56, tells Reuters that he recognized the young man in the surveillance photo as his nephew.

    The Charleston community mourns the loss of several members following Wednesday night's shooting. 
    
"The more I look at him, the more I'm convinced, that's him," Carson Cowles, 56, tells Reuters in a phone interview.
Cowles said Roof was given a gun by his father as a 21st birthday present in April.
The killer walked into the church Wednesday evening and sat with the Bible group for about an hour before pulling out a weapon and firing, reportedly reloading several times.
A federal law enforcement official said Thursday that the shooter was believed to be armed with a handgun and allegedly shouted racial epithets at the time of the attack. The information came from interviews with survivors, said the official who is not authorized to comment publicly.
The official also said a semi-automatic handgun had been kept in the suspect's home.
"This is an all-hands-on-deck effort with the community as well as law enforcement," Mullen said during the search. "When people go out they should be vigilant, they should be aware of their surroundings. And if they see anything suspicious, they should call law enforcement."
"No one in this community will forget this night," said Mullen, who called the killings at the Emanuel AME church a "hate crime."
In Washington, the Justice Department said its Civil Rights Division, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina are opening a hate crime investigation into the shooting.
Eight of the victims died at the church and the ninth died at a hospital. Three were men; six were women. Three people survived, police said.
Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of Pinckney, said one of the survivors told her that the gunman reloaded five times during the ordeal.
At point, as he was reloading, members of the group tried to get him to stop, Johnson told WIS News.
"He just said 'I have to do it. You rape our women and you're taking over our country. And you have to go," Johnson said.

Charleston, S.C., shooting: What we know now
Dot Scott, president of the Charleston NAACP, said the gunman apparently allowed one woman to live so that she could tell others what happened inside the church.
Mayor Riley called the killings "the most unspeakable and heartbreaking tragedy."
"The only reason that someone could walk into a church and shoot people praying is out of hate," Riley said. "It is the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine, and we will bring that person to justice. ... This is one hateful person."
Police issued photos of the suspect and his apparent getaway car, a four-door, black sedan.
The gunman, called "armed and dangerous," was described as a white male in his early 20s, with sandy blond hair. He was wearing a gray sweatshirt with a yellow symbol on his left side.
The photo of the suspect, taken by a surveillance camera, indicated that he is about 5 feet, 9 inches tall, and sported a distinctive bowl-like haircut, possibly a wig.
Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research at the Anti-Defamation League, said the patches of South Africa and Rhodesia worn on Roof's jacket could provide clues as to his ideological views.
"No one randomly puts those particular images on clothing or Facebook profiles," said Pitcavage says. "That implies intent and a particular world view. This is not someone simply motivated by hate but may have been motivated by a particular ideology as well."
The church is a historic African-American church that traces its roots to 1816, when several churches split from Charleston's Methodist Episcopal church.
Community organizer Christopher Cason said he felt certain the shootings were racially motivated. "I am very tired of people telling me that I don't have the right to be angry," Cason said. "I am very angry right now."

Gunman sat in meeting at church before shooting
Pinckney, the 41-year-old pastor, was a married father of two who was elected to the state house at age 23, making him the youngest member of the House at the time.
"He never had anything bad to say about anybody, even when I thought he should," Rutherford, D-Columbia, said. "He was always out doing work either for his parishioners or his constituents. He touched everybody."
Emanuel is the oldest AME church in the South and has one of the oldest and largest black congregations south of Baltimore, according to its website. Denmark Vesey, executed for attempting to organize a major slave rebellion in 1822, was one of the founders.
Said Police Chief Mullen: "This is a tragedy that no community should have to experience. It is senseless. It is unfathomable that someone would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives."
