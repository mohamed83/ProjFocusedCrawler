ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI)- All four suspects accused of ambushing a St. Louis police officer in the Central West End are now in custody. Our partners at the St. Louis Post- Dispatch captured photos of the prime suspect’s arrest after a two-day manhunt.


A SWAT Team captured Dale Wolford in Maplewood Thursday morning. His face was bloodied and bruised after police say he resisted arrest. A second suspect, Aaron Collins, turned himself in. He was seen with his mother before officers took him away in handcuffs.


Police also arrested two other suspects.


The four are accused in the shooting of a police sergeant Tuesday morning as he worked secondary patrol in Maryland Plaza.


Police Chief Sam Dotson says he’s seen the video. “That video with the suspects car pulling directly in front of the Sergeant’s car, passenger got out of the car and immediately fired. The police officer never exited his vehicle. He was shot while he was sitting in the driver’s seat of the car and returned fire while he was seated in the driver’s seat of the car.”


He says the officer’s bullet-proof vest saved his life.


The motive for the shooting is still unclear.
