Kanye West and Lupe Fiasco both raised their voices on the subject of race in America this weekend, in the aftermath of the Charleston church murders.
West, headlining Hot 107.9’s Birthday Bash in Atlanta on Saturday night, addressed the killings in a freestyle, whose lyrics were reprinted in full at missinfo.tv. “See that’s the magic of racism, it works on itself,” he rapped. “We hate each other, screw each other, kill each other / When we can’t kill nobody else / See that’s the magic of lackin’ resources, it works on itself / 500 niggas gettin’ pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-popped / And North Carolina didn’t help.” While this is thought to refer to the Charleston murders, Charleston is actually in South Carolina.
Lupe Fiasco, meanwhile, used Instagram to publish a three-part open letter, addressed “Dear White Supremacy”, with each of his three posts illustrated with a photo of Dylann Roof, who has been charged with nine counts of murder following the shooting spree at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. 
The letter opened: “First of all you are not really that supreme. While throughout history White Supremacy it must be admitted you have achieved some very dominant positions. These positions have been gained mostly through force or some biological agent such as disease that did a lot of the dirty work for you in advance. I mean anybody can use force on an unarmed populous and anybody can have smallpox. Not judging, just wanted to point out that having a disease that native folks aren’t immune to because they’ve never seen it doesn’t make you strategically smart or tactically superior, just kind of sick.”
He concluded: “If you wanted to get really ironic and meta about it, White Supremacy has to validate it’s own identity based solely on its relationship to other races! I mean now that’s what I would call joined at the hip. Without us there is no white supremacy because there would be nothing to be supreme over! That sounds so stupid but sometimes the truth is stupid.”
