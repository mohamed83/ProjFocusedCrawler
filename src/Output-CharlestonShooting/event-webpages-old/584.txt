TRACY —
Tracy police are asking for the public’s help identifying a bank robbery suspect.
Police believe a man who robbed a Raley’s supermarket on Tracy Boulevard on June 11 may be the same suspect in a robbery on June 22 in a neighboring city in Stanislaus County.
Anyone who thinks they recognize the suspect is urged to call the Tracy Police Department at (209) 831-6631.
