ST. LOUIS COUNTY, MO (KTVI) – Sheila Duckworth received quite a scare when a suspect being pursued by police burst into her north county apartment looking for a place to hide from authorities. Duckworth says the man offered her a thousand dollars to protect him from authorities, but she refused. Officers with weapons drawn entered Duckworth’s home and found him hiding in her daughter’s bed under the covers. He was taken into custody. A second suspect was arrested a block away after he crashed the vehicle they were riding in into a parked car.
There’s no word on why the men ran from police or what charges they are facing.
