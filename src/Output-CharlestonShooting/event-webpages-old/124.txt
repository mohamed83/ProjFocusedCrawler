Who’s to say, at this point?  It’s just plain crazy. They say the shooter is white, but the picture looks like he is dark-skinned, maybe not black, but some “other” .  It’s definitely more ammunition for the race wars.







Life is full of trials, but opportunities are hidden in every last one of them, and this life is about so much more than the average man realizes.  Slow down,  look around, there are treasures for the having, if you can spot them! Cancel reply
