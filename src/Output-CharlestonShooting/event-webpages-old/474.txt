Police shoot and kill man with machete


 


Jonesboro, AR (WREG) — A Jonesboro man is dead after an officer involved shooting overnight.
Jonesboro police say they were trying to arrest a 31-year-old man on violent felony charges at his home in the 900 block of Walnut Street. Police say the man ran inside his home around 11:40 p.m. Tuesday and tried to slam the door shut on officers, then hit one of the officers with a machete. That officer then fired several shots, but was not sure he hit the suspect who had closed the door.
Because they were not sure the man was hit, he was considered armed and dangerous and the tactical squad was called. The team entered the home around 1:30 a.m. at which time they found the man’s body.
It is not clear if the officer was injured.
Jonesboro Police Chief Rick Elliott has asked the Arkansas State Police to investigate.
