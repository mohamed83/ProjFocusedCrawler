St. Louis police: Woman justified in fatally shooting man


 


ST. LOUIS (AP) – St. Louis police say a woman was justified in fatally shooting a man after she was stabbed in a hand with scissors.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the shooting happened during a dispute early Sunday between the 35-year-old woman and 57-year-old man at a St. Louis home. Their names have not been released.
Police say the man produced the scissors when the woman asked him to leave. During an ensuing struggle, the woman managed to retrieve a firearm and shot the man.
The woman declined medical treatment at the scene.
