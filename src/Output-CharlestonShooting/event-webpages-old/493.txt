Missouri House panel ponders police shooting absence policy


 


JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) – Supporters say a proposal to require unpaid leave for an officer during investigations of some police-involved fatal shootings would help restore trust after the shooting death of an 18-year-old in Ferguson.
A House committee heard support for a measure Monday that would mandate an officer go on unpaid leave until an investigation of the fatal shooting is completed.
It would apply only if the officer shot a person who was unarmed and more than 20 feet away.
No one spoke against the measure but some Republican lawmakers questioned how it would affect officers’ ability to support their families.
National Bar Association President Pamela Meanes says the measure would speed investigations into police-involved shootings.
The committee chairman says the committee will vote on the proposal in two weeks.
