ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Six of the seven protesters arrested outside the home of a prosecutor who cleared a police officer in a fatal shooting have been issued city summonses for peace disturbance, resisting arrest and trespassing.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports another protestor was charged with misdemeanor assault on a law enforcement officer for allegedly wiping pepper spray from her face onto the St. Louis police chief’s torso.
About 40 protestors gathered outside Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce’s home Tuesday night, chanting, “No justice, no sleep.” They were protesting Joyce’s decision not to bring charges against a white, off-duty police officer who shot and killed black 18-year-old VonDerrit Myers Jr. in October.
Joyce, who was home at the time, posted a statement on her office’s website condemning the demonstration.
