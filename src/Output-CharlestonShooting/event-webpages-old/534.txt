U.N. Experts Deplore Killings of African-Americans in Church 
A statement by Mireille Fanon Mendes France, chairwoman of the United Nations’ Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent:
“We utterly condemn the appalling attack on the Emanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston, South Carolina, yesterday and the killing of nine African-Americans. We welcome the prompt action by the authorities to investigate this hate crime. Every effort must be made to ensure the person guilty of this act is prosecuted and punished accordingly. Urgent measures must be taken to prevent gun violence and racist crimes motivated by prejudice that affect the security of Afro-Americans, their communities and society as a whole. We offer our heartfelt condolences to the people of the U.S.A., especially the families and friends of those who were murdered while in worship at church.”
