Indianapolis Metro Police investigating fatal shooting on near west side.






 






INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (Aug. 1, 2015) — Detectives with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) are looking for the person who shot and killed a man. Just after 1 p.m. Saturday, police responded to the 700 block of North Lynn Street on the near west side, which is where the shooting happened. Myers’ family says he was a 40-year-old father of two, ages six and 13. One of his children showed up to the spot where her father was killed and broke down in tears. Upset, as well, are his friends.


“Too much violence, it ain’t really nothing new though, it ain’t really nothing new. It’s been going on,” said Darius Johnson, upset about the death of his friend. “He don’t bother nobody or nothing like that. Wrong place, wrong time.”


Myers was shot a number of times, found by police inside of a car. Detectives heard from witnesses that Myers was involved in some type of argument with two other people just before he was killed.


“Our victim was shot multiple times in his upper torso and died here on the scene. Two black males were last seen fleeing in a vehicle southbound on North Lynn Street,” said Lieutenant Richard Riddle.


The area where this happened is known to police.


“We’ve had a couple of known incidents of shots fired and we had a homicide about a month ago in this same block,” Lt. Riddle added.


If you have any information that could help solve this, you asked to call IMPD or Central Indiana Crime Stoppers at 317-262-TIPS (8477).

Nominations are open for 2015 CNN Heroes (CNN)Debbie Dills was driving to work Thursday mid-morning with the terrible news about the church massacre stirring constantly in her mind. She had learned of the shooting deaths of nine people in Charleston, South Carolina, after she left her North Carolina church Wednesday night.She saw the people on TV praying, asking God to help someone find the killer.Dills, hundreds of miles away, believes God used her to answer those prayers.Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 The 51-year-old woman was driving along a four-lane U.S. highway about 10:30 a.m. Thursday when she spotted Dylann Roof driving a black Hyundai toward the town of Kings Mountain. "I don't know what drew my attention to the car," she told CNN's Don Lemon. She saw it had a South Carolina license plate. "In my mind I'm thinking, 'That can't be.' ... I never dreamed that it would be the car." But she thought the driver was the same man whose photos had been on the news as the suspect. She called her boss at the florist shop, Todd Frady, and told him she thought she might be following the alleged killer. She pulled off the road to ask Frady what she should do.He got on the phone with the Kings Mountain police while Dills started driving again in an attempt to catch the Hyundai so she could report the license plate number.She caught up with Roof at a stoplight and was right behind him."I was very nervous," she said. Roof continued west on U.S. 74 into Shelby. Dills had now been following the suspect for more than 30 miles. Shelby police caught up with Roof, pulled him over and took him into custody.Dills told the Shelby Star that she was late for work Thursday. It put her in the right place to answer the prayers of the people in Charleston, she said.She told CNN she was a vessel through which God worked. "It was Him from the time I left my house this morning. It was Him that made me look at that car. It was God who made this happen," she told Lemon. "God heard the prayers of those people."Roof never adjusted his speed or driving she told the Star."He wasn't doing anything abnormal," she said. "He wasn't driving slow. He was just driving. He just kept going."More CNN HeroesWarrior Hike helps combat veterans healHelping Miami kids choose 'Guitars Over Guns'Caring for those who don't want to die aloneTurning gorilla poachers into protectorsHe feeds 1 million kids every school dayArt pioneer once expelled for doodling40% of U.S. food goes to waste: One man's solutionMeet the doctor who treats the homelessBabysitting money plants seed to help kidsBeing there for single parents with cancerChoosing 'Guitars Over Guns'Introducing city kids to nature -- by bikeHelping kids 'see' their futureUnlikely mechanic gives needy a 'lift'How to nominate a 2015 CNN HeroMore from USAfter Confederate flag comes down, Charleston church starts new chapterTranquilized bear falls from tree -- and appears to be waving -- in ColoradoHarper Lee's new book portrays Atticus Finch as racist; fans on Twitter aghastMore from Steve AlmasyKin of crime victims say Trump speaks for them on immigrationJames Holmes says he won't testifyAlleged accomplice of man who tried to rob ex-CNNers charged in deathNewsU.S.WorldPoliticsTechHealthEntertainmentLivingTravelMoneySportsVideoCNNgoLatest NewsMust Watch VideosDigital StudiosTVCNNgoScheduleCNN FilmsShows A-ZFaces of CNN WorldwideOpinionsPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryiReportMore…PhotosLongformInvestigationsCNN profiles A-ZCNN LeadershipU.S. EditionU.S.InternationalArabicEspañolSet edition preferenceConfirm© 2015 Cable News Network.
