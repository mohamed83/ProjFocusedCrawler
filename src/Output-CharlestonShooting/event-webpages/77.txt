Funerals for some of the victims of the Charleston church shooting were being held on Saturday at the church in which they were killed.
Services were first held for 54-year-old Cynthia Hurd at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, 10 days after a gunman allegedly entered the church and killed her and eight other people – all African-Americans – during a Bible-study session. Police say the attack was racially motivated.
Hurd, a long-time Charleston librarian, will be remembered as a tireless public servant and loving family member, speakers at her funeral said. Attendees included South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, US senator Tim Scott and the Reverend Jesse Jackson.
“Her death will lead to change and Cynthia Hurd will be helping millions,” said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, in a eulogy.
Riley remembered Hurd as a young girl serving ice cream. She went from serving people ice cream, he said, “to leading them to knowledge” as a librarian for almost 30 years.
The killings will go down in history with other episodes of church violence, Riley said, referencing the civil rights-era bombing of a Baptist church in Alabama that killed four girls.
The tragedy “shook an America that didn’t want to believe this kind of hate could still exist”, Riley said.
Funerals for Tywanza Sanders, 26, and his great aunt Susie Jackson, 87, were to take place at the church later in the day.
The funerals followed one on Friday for another victim, the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, whose eulogy was delivered in person by President Barack Obama.
Obama sang a hymn of hope and spoke with the fervour of a preacher as he eulogised Pinckney, and minced no words in calling for an end to racial injustice and gun violence in the US. Obama suddenly began singing Amazing Grace, and was quickly joined by ministers and some of the thousands who packed into the arena at the College of Charleston in South Carolina.
The president called for gun control and efforts to eliminate poverty and job discrimination, and said the Confederate battle flag – long a symbol of Southern pride – must be removed from places of honour.

“For many – black and white – that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation. We see that now,” he said.
Hours later, a woman was arrested early on Saturday on the grounds of the South Carolina Capitol in Columbia, after scaling a flagpole to rip down a Confederate flag that flew at a memorial in front of the statehouse. 
Bree Newsome, 30, was arrested immediately. She and James Ian Tyson, 30, also of Charlotte, face misdemeanor charges in the incident.
