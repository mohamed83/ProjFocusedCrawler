Obama on gun violence: six years of statements but change remains elusive


 ‘We have been through this too many times.’ In his seven years in office, most legislative efforts to reform America’s gun laws have failed because of Congress

<<<<<<< HEAD
NEWARK, N.J. — Police are investigating deadly shootings that happened Wednesday in Newark.


The shooting comes one day after Newark Mayor Ras Baraka accused the Wall Street Journal of skewing the statistics about the shootings in the city.


NJ.com reports that in the first incident
, Andre Singh, 32, of Newark and an unidentified male were shot in the 300 block of Sanford Avenue. Singh was transported to University Hospital in Newark where he later died.


About an hour later, a man identified as Dashiell Donaldson, 28, of Irvington, died after being shot and killed in the 200 block of Ridgewood Avenue, authorities said.


Another man, who remains unidentified,  died Wednesday afternoon after being stabbed to death during an apparent home burglary, NJ.com reported.


All three deaths are under active investigation.


No arrests have been made.


Anyone with information is asked to contact the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office Homicide/Major Crimes Task Force at 1-877-847-7432 or 1-877-TIPS-4-EC.
