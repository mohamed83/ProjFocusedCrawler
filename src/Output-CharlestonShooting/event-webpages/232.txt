2 police killings, 2 outcomes: Lessons learned from Ferguson to South Carolina

In both cases, a white police officer kills an unarmed black man. But the outcomes so far have been wildly different.
So what’s changed between the shooting deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina?
Here are some of the stark differences in the cases, the lessons learned by both police and the public and concrete changes that could mend tensions in the future.
Violence to peace 
Ferguson: The largely peaceful protests in Ferguson were marred by looting, arson and even shootings. Violence erupted in November after the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson, wasn’t indicted.
And even after Ferguson’s police chief resigned last month, two officers were shot during a protest at the Ferguson Police Department.
North Charleston: But after Scott was killed in South Carolina over the weekend, protests in North Charleston have been peaceful.
The difference could be that while Wilson was never charged, the North Charleston officer, Michael Slager, has been arrested, charged with murder and fired.
The city’s response 
Ferguson: It took Ferguson police six days to identify Wilson as the officer who shot Brown.
North Charleston: Slager was identified by authorities and charged with murder on Tuesday, two days after Feidin Santana, who recorded the shooting, shared his video with Scott’s family.
Video footage
Ferguson: There was no bystander video of Brown’s death — no concrete evidence to support witness claims that Brown had his hands up to surrender.
North Charleston: It’s unlikely Slager would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by Santana.
Not only does the video show Slager firing eight shots at Scott as he is running away, it also shows Slager picking up a dark-colored object that had fallen to the ground and later placing a dark object next to Slager’s lifeless body.
That could be significant because Slager initially said Scott had taken his Taser stun gun and feared for his life. But if investigators determine the object dropped next to Scott’s body was actually the Taser, Slager could be accused of planting evidence.
Body cameras
Ferguson: After Brown’s death last August, many asked why Wilson didn’t have a body camera. The shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether all officers should wear cameras on their lapels.

Three months later, President Barack Obama pledged $263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers.
North Charleston: Slager also was not wearing a body camera when he killed Scott. But after the shooting, Mayor Keith Summey said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras “so every officer on the street” in the city will have one. That’s in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, Summey said.
