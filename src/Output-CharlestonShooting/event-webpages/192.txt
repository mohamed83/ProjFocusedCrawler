CHICAGO (CBS) —
 A Chicago police officer shot and killed a man who allegedly pointed a gun at the officer during a chase in the Park Manor neighborhood Thursday afternoon.


Police said, around 3:30 p.m., police officers from the Grand Crossing District spotted a man carrying a gun in the 6700 block of South Indiana Avenue.


CBS 2’s Roseanne Tellez reports, when the officers approached the suspect and announced they were the police, the suspect fled down an alley. The officers gave chase and, at some point – fearing for his life – one of the officers fired at the suspect, striking him one time.


Chicago Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden said the suspect had pointed his gun at the officer.


The suspect, a man in his 20s, died at the scene, officials said.


Investigators remained on the scene Thursday evening, and the Independent Police Review Authority was looking into the shooting.


A weapon was recovered at the scene, police said.
