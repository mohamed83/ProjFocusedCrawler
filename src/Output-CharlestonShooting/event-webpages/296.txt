NEW YORK— Police say 31-year-old Isaiah Rivera and 26- year-old Joey Cruz are wanted in connection to a string of rape and robbery cases, all happening within the past few months.

The most recent incident happened near Gramercy Park this past Tuesday. Police say the victim arranged to meet one of the suspects at her apartment on Lexington Ave. That’s when two additional suspects showed up,  and the victim was maced and then raped by all three men. Her money and belongings stolen.


One woman who lives in the area near Baruch College says it’s not surprising to hear.


A similar incident happened in a hotel room at the Grand Hyatt on East 42nd Street this past Monday.


Another, at the end of June on East 138th Street in the Bronx.


Even though in all three cases the victims had arranged to meet with one of the suspects and invited him in, those hearing about the crimes are now worried about their own safety.


Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 800-577-TIPS.
