KING’S MOUNTAIN, N.C. – The quick-thinking of one North Carolina woman helped police catch a man accused of killing nine people at a South Carolina church.


Debbie Dills got a bad feeling when she was driving into work Thursday morning.


Just after 10 a.m., something caught her eye as she was driving on Highway 74 near Shelby.


“I saw the back of his head,” Dills said. “And I saw that bowl cut, that hair.”


She called her boss at Frady’s Florist in Kings Mountain, about 15 miles outside Shelby.


“I think that I have just passed the car the boy was driving that killed the people in Charleston,” Dills remembered telling her boss.


Around 10:45 a.m., Shelby police caught and arrested 21-year-old Dylann Roof, accused of shooting and killing nine people at a Charleston church during Bible study Wednesday night.


“Once we got him in custody, we brought him here,” said Shelby Police Chief Jeff Ledford. “We notified Charleston to let them know we had their suspect.”


Dills said she had been thinking of the nine victims when she decided to call her boss and notify police.


“They were studying His word,” Dills said. “That’s what they were there to do and they lost their life doing that.”


“They can never come back,” Dills said. “But those families can find some kind of solace, some kind of peace and some kind of comfort in knowing that the young man is caught.”


Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten identified the nine shooting victims as follows: Cynthia Hurd, 54; Susie Jackson, 87; Ethel Lance, 70; Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Hon. Rev. Clementa Pinckney, 41; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; Rev. Sharonda Singleton, 45; Myra Thompson, 59.

Dylann Storm Roof: Police Name Suspect in Charleston Church Shooting

Posted 9:06 am, June 18, 2015, by Tribune Media Wire and CNN 

FacebookTwitterGoogleEmailRedditTumblr 


CHARLESTON, S.C. — Dylann Roof, 21, of Lexington, South Carolina, is the suspect in Wednesday’s deadly shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the Charleston police said Thursday. He may be driving a black Hyundai with vehicle tag LGF330, police said.
The nine shooting victims at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church “were killed because they were black,” Charleston police spokesman Charles Francis told CNN’s Nick Valencia on Thursday. Francis said this after Valencia asked them what is leading authorities to investigate the shooting as a hate crime.
A woman who survived the shooting says the gunman said he was letting her live so that she could tell people what happened, Charleston NAACP President Dot Scott told CNN.
According to The Post and Courier, Roof is currently out on bond in connection with multiple recent arrests on drug and trespassing charges.
Police released a flier Thursday morning with details of the suspect in the attack on the historic African-American church as they appealed for help to track him down as quickly as possible.
“The following subject is wanted for the shooting that occured in Charleston at the Emanuel AME Church. Subject is Dylann Storm Roof w/m 4/3/1994 5’9″ 120 lbs. The subject should be driving a 2000 Hyundai Elantra GS, SC registration LGF330. The vehicle is dark-colored. Subject should be considered armed and dangerous and caution should be used if seen. ”
 
Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen told a news conference that officers “have obtained surveillance videos of the suspect in this case and a suspect vehicle.”
The uncle of the suspect told Reuters he recognized his nephew in the photo released by police. He also said Roof received a .45 caliber pistol as a birthday present in April.
Mullen emphasized the suspect is “a very dangerous individual” and said “he should not be approached by anyone.”
Any people who recognize the suspect or spots the vehicle should alert law enforcement, he said, rather than trying to follow themselves.
Woman spared by shooter to give account?
A female survivor told family members that the gunman told her he was letting her live to tell everyone else what happened, Dot Scott, president of the local branch of the NAACP, told CNN.
Scott said she had not spoken to the survivor directly but had heard this account repeated at least a dozen times as she met with relatives of the victims Wednesday night. Scott added that she didn’t know if the survivor had ended up at the hospital or being questioned by police.
Because of the church’s historic significance, it is not unusual for visitors, whether white or black, to visit it, Scott said. She said she’d had no indication that any children were among the victims.
Mullen told the news conference the suspect had been in the church attending a meeting that was going on — and “stayed there almost an hour with the group before the actual event.”
But he declined to comment on whether the suspect had let one woman escape.
‘Distinctive’ license plate
The suspect was seen leaving the church in a black four-door sedan, the flier says. “The vehicle you will see has a very distinctive front license plate,” Mullen added.
He appealed for the media to help in circulating the suspect’s image and for the public to be vigilant. The clean-shaven man pictured wears a gray sweatshirt over a white T-shirt, blue jeans and Timberland boots.
“No one in this community will ever forget this night and as a result of this and because of the pain and the hurt this individual has caused this entire community, the law enforcement agents are committed and we will catch this individual,” Mullen said.
Charleston Mayor Joe Riley echoed that sentiment, saying everything must be done to find a culprit he described as “somebody filled with hate and with a deranged mind.”
The man is a “no-good, horrible person” who must be taken into custody as soon as possible, he said. “Of course we will make sure he pays the price for this horrible act.”
Wednesday night’s attack at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is being investigated as a hate crime. All the victims, who include the church’s pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, were black. Six of those killed were female and three male.
