Is country music ready to dissociate from the Confederate flag?

>>>>>>> origin/master




<<<<<<< HEAD
CHICAGO (CBS)
 – A Chicago police officer fatally shot an armed suspect in West Englewood Thursday morning – the second police-involved shooting within 24 hours.


The incident occurred about 11:40 a.m. when an officer witnessed a male offender firing gunshots at two people near 63
rd
 Street and Honore Street, Chicago police said in a prepared statement.




The officer identified himself, but the suspect continued firing, prompting the officer to shoot the gunman, police said.


The wounds were fatal.


Relatives identified the slain man as Divonte Young.


“One of his friends came to me and said ‘Grandma, Divonte just got shot and I just lost it,’” Marion Young, the alleged gunman’s grandmother, tells CBS 2’s Suzanne Le Mignot.


Young’s family says the 20-year-old just celebrated his little girl’s first birthday.


Family friend Tiffany Williams says Young and his girlfriend had gone into a store near the shooting site. Both got into an argument with some men in the store. When Young and his girlfriend left, the men were waiting for them outside.


Wednesday night, about three miles east of the shooting, police shot and killed a 19-year-old man who opened fire on them.
