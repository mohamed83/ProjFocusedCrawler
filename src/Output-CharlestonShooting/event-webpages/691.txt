Police looking for suspects in Millcreek shooting


 


MILLCREEK, Utah — Officers from the Unified Police Department are looking for four people involved in a shooting at a Millcreek apartment complex early Monday morning.
The shooting was reported at about 1:00 at 3923 S 700 W. Witnesses told police three men who were riding in a red Dodge Neon got out of the car approached one of the apartments. Police said two teenage boys, ages 15 and 17, answered the door and got into an argument with the men.
Witnesses said they heard shots fired and the teens went down. Police said the three men then ran back to the car, where a fourth person was waiting for them, and the car fled west on 3900 S.
“One of the things we are looking into in this case is a motive for this crime. We do believe there are some gang connections to this, and we’re looking to see if that is the main reason for this crime,” said Lt. Justin Hoyal, Unified Police Department, in an interview Monday morning. “We have detectives interviewing those victims right now, and we’re trying to identify those suspects and get them caught.”
The two victims were taken by a personal vehicle to Intermountain Medical Center in fair condition.
Witnesses told police the three men who got out of the Neon are all African-American. Anyone with information that may assist police in this case is urged to call Unified Police at (801) 743-7000.
