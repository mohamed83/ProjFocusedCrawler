 (CNN)
When Dylann Storm Roof turned 21 in April, his father bought him a .45-caliber gun, a senior law enforcement source briefed on the investigation said Thursday. 
It's not known whether that handgun was used when Roof allegedly opened fire Wednesday night at a prayer meeting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, 
killing nine people
.
"You rape our women, and you're taking over our country. And you have to go," Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of the church's slain pastor, said the gunman told his victims, according to 
CNN affiliate WIS
. She cited survivors of the shooting.
In the sparse details that have emerged about his life, none would suggest he was capable of such hatred and violence. 
Dylann Roof is escorted from the Cleveland County Courthouse in Shelby, North Carolina, on Thursday, June 18. 
Police in his hometown of Columbia -- about 120 miles northwest of Charleston -- obtained a warrant for his arrest in early March. He had been picked up on drug charges a few days earlier at Columbiana Centre mall, according to a police report. 
Workers at two stores told mall security that Roof was acting strangely, asking "out of the ordinary questions" such as the number of sales associates and what time they left the mall, the police report said.
 
Roof, when confronted, "began speaking very nervously and stated that his parents were pressuring him to get a job," according to the police report. Roof told the officer he had not picked up any employment applications. 
Banned from mall
Roof initially said he wasn't carrying anything illegal. But he agreed to be searched and an officer found "a small unlabeled white bottle containing multiple orange ... square strips" in his jacket, the police report said. 
The bottle contained Listerine breath strips, Roof said. 
The officer asked again. Roof said the strips were suboxone, which is used to treat opiate addiction, according to the police report. Roof said he got the strips from a friend.
He was arrested on a drug possession charge that day in late February, but it's unclear why the March 1 arrest warrant was issued. 
On April 26, police were again called to Columbiana Centre because Roof, who had been banned from the mall for a year after his drug arrest, had returned, the police report said. The ban was extended to three years.
Roof was arrested that day in late April on a charge of trespassing; his car was turned over to his mother. The disposition of the case is unclear.
 
One schoolmate of Dylann Roof described him as "kind of wild" but not violent.
John Mullins, who attended White Knoll High School with Roof, told CNN on Thursday that the suspect was "kind of wild" but not violent. 
"He was ... calm," Mullins said. "That's why all this is such a shock."
Mullins said Roof occasionally made racist comments although he had black friends.
"They were just racist slurs in a sense," he said. "He would say it just as a joke. ... I never took it seriously, but now that he shed his other side, so maybe they should have been taken more seriously."
Roof repeated the ninth grade at the Lexington County high school, according to Mary Beth Hill of the Lexington School District. She said he was "very transient," that he "came and went." 
'Quiet, strange, very unsocial' 
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said his niece, Emily, was in an 
eighth-grade English class with Roof.
"He was quiet, strange, very unsocial and everyone thought he was on drugs," Graham said of the suspect, relaying the description from Emily and his sister, Darline Graham Nordone.
The niece did not recall Roof making statements related to race, Graham said.

"I just think he was one of these whacked-out kids. I don't think it's anything broader than that," said Graham, who is running for president. "It's about a young man who is obviously twisted." 
On Wednesday night, the white and slightly built gunman was at the historic African-American church for about an hour, attending a meeting with his 
eventual victims
, before the massacre, according to Charleston police Chief Greg Mullen. 
Witnesses told investigators the gunman stood up and said he was there "to shoot black people," a law enforcement official said.
Investigators are looking into whether Roof had links to white supremacist or other hate groups, a law enforcement official said. There's no indication so far that he was known to law enforcement officials who focus on hate groups.
In an image tweeted by authorities in Berkeley County, South Carolina, Roof is seen wearing a jacket with what appear to be the flags of apartheid-era South Africa and nearby Rhodesia, a former British colony that a white minority ruled until it became independent in 1980 and changed its name to Zimbabwe.
Woman spared by shooter to give account?
A female survivor told family members that the gunman told her he was letting her live to tell everyone else what happened, Dot Scott, president of the local branch of the NAACP, told CNN.

Scott said she had not spoken to the survivor directly but heard this account repeated at least a dozen times as she met with relatives of the victims Wednesday night. 
"No one in this community will ever forget this night and ... the pain and the hurt this individual has caused this entire community," Mullen said.
Charleston Mayor Joe Riley said the suspect was "filled with hate and with a deranged mind."
The man is a "no-good, horrible person," he said.
 
"Of course we will make sure he pays the price for this horrible act."

﻿Worshippers return to Charleston’s Emanuel AME on Sunday


 The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is the oldest AME church in the South. Nine people died in a hate crime shooting on June 17, 2015.


CHARLESTON, SC — The site of a horrific mass killing has become a house of worship again.
Hundreds filled the pews of historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, for services Sunday morning.
They sang hymns, prayed and remembered the nine church members shot to death Wednesday night during Bible study.
“The doors of the church are open,” declared the Rev. Norvel Goff during prayers. “No evildoer, no demon in hell or on Earth can close the doors of God’s church,” he proclaimed.
One of the victims was the church’s pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney. His seat behind the podium was shrouded in black cloth and uniformed police officers were present in the side aisles.
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, U.S. Sen. Tim Scott and the mayors of Charleston and North Charleston were among the worshippers.
Outside the church, where a makeshift memorial covers the entire sidewalk, crowds gathered in the street and listened to the service through loudspeakers.
At 10 a.m., churches around Charleston — nicknamed the Holy City because it has so many houses of worship — rang their bells in solidarity with Emanuel AME.
On Sunday night, a unity chain will be held on the 13,200-foot Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge. Organizers hope to attract enough people to hold hands and stretch from Charleston to the town of Mount Pleasant on the other side of the Cooper River.
“When something this horrendous happens this close to home, you are compelled to do something,” event coordinator Dorsey Fairbairn said on Facebook.
‘Hate’s not in me’
Two law enforcement officials have said Dylann Roof of Lexington, South Carolina, admitted to shooting and killing the people he’d sat with for Bible study at the historically black church.
Roof, 21, is white, and all the victims were black. He told investigators he did it to start a race war, according to one of the officials.
The church area remained a crime scene, and thus off limits to church members, until Charleston police released it Saturday.
On Friday, Roof appeared at a bond hearing. Families of the victims addressed him and said they forgave him.
That message was echoed by Arthur Hurd, husband of victim Cynthia Hurd. He’s in the Merchant Marine and arrived in Charleston on Saturday.
“This is all surreal, but what I can say to that young man is that in time I will forgive you,” Hurd told CNN affiliate WCIV.
“I won’t move past this, but I will forgive you. But I hope for the rest of your life, however long or short that may be, you stop and play that tape over and over and over again in your head and see the sheer terror and pain you put purely innocent people through. …”
“I would love to hate you but hate’s not in me. If I hate you I’m no better than you.”
People angry about the killings took to the streets Saturday.
In Charleston, hundreds joined the March for Black Lives.
The group began the march in total silence, walking to Emanuel AME Church from a nearby park, and stopped outside the church to lay flowers at the makeshift memorial.
Once marchers passed the church, the group filled Charleston’s iconic King Street, usually packed with tourists this time of year. Many carried signs of support for the victims of the Charleston shooting and the black community: “STILL WE RISE,” “Hand in Hand,” “Do the right thing,” “Black Lives Matter.”
The march ended with a rally outside the historic Daughters of the Confederacy building.
‘Take it down’
“That terrorist did not win. He wanted to invoke terror and fear in our community, but we are not for that,” an organizer said to the crowd. “We are standing up together, arm in arm. … We will not bow down, but we will stand up.”
Despite the sweltering heat, a large crowd filled the front grounds of the South Carolina Capitol in Columbia calling for the Confederate flag to be removed.
“Take it down, take it down,” chanted the crowd, filled with people of all races and ages holding signs.
One woman’s sign said, “Love breeds love, hate breeds hate.” Another man’s sign said, “Remove my ancestors sign.”
Organizers of the event, the South Carolina Progressive Network, estimated between 1,500 and 1,700 people attended.
Racist website
Investigators are looking at a website featuring a racist manifesto that mentions Charleston as the “historic” target of an attack and displays images of Roof.
The 2,000-word text explains the writer’s philosophy of white superiority, saying the Trayvon Martin case “truly awakened me” and that “I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country.”
Motive has become the biggest question as state and federal investigators work on the case — and statements and photos on the website match what investigators have determined so far.
Martin’s parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, addressed the gunman’s assertion. Their son was killed by in 2012 by a neighborhood watch volunteer who was acquitted.
“The Trayvon Martin movement was not created to incite hate or further racial divide, but rather birthed to raise awareness to the social injustices that exist across America with regards to senseless gun violence against our young black and brown boys; the movement also focuses on the growing disparities in the lack of prosecution of the actual perpetrators,” they said in a statement.
