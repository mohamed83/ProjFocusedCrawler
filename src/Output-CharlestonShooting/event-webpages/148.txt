 The nine victims of the 
Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting
 were remembered Thursday as "kind-hearted" members of the community — six women and three men who shared a love of family and faith. 


 They had gathered Wednesday night — as they did each week — at the 
Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church
 for a Bible study session. About an hour later, a 21-year-old gunman opened fire in a fit of rage, police said. 


 Charleston County coroner Rae Wooten identified all nine victims in a press conference Thursday.

 "Immediately my heart started to sink because I knew this was going to mean a forever impact on many, many people," Wooten said about being called in for duty after the massacre Wednesday night. 


 The oldest victim was 87 years old, the youngest, 26. Four of them were reverends. Here's what we know about the slain parishioners, all of whom died of gunshot wounds — eight at the scene, and one in a hospital operating room later.

The library in Charleston managed by Cynthia Graham Hurd before she was killed in last week’s Emanuel AME church shootings is being renamed in her honour.
Hurd was one of nine victims who died during Bible study at the Charleston church on 17 June. Charleston county council met on Thursday to vote on whether St Andrews regional library, where Hurd had been branch manager since 2011, should be renamed the Cynthia Graham Hurd St Andrews regional library. The motion was passed unanimously, according to the Post and Courier, which reported that Hurd’s family and friends had filled the front row of the council’s chambers as the resolution was read out.
Her brother, the former North Carolina senator Malcolm Graham, has described Hurd as “a librarian’s librarian”, who “enjoyed working with the kids, but she also realised her job extended beyond the walls of the library”. She had worked in the Charleston county library system for 31 years.
“She helped [children] discover themselves and learn skills that gave them the ability to live and grow, but she also was there to help people work through their problems. It went beyond just checking out books and helping people find jobs; she was there for people throughout the community who sought her advice on a variety of issues,” Graham said, adding that his sister was a “book nerd, always a very smart young lady, and she loved reading from a very young age”.
Hurd’s family has also set up the Cynthia Graham Hurd Fund for Reading and Literacy, which will benefit Freedom School Partners, a programme of summer education for children in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Cynthia was a passionate advocate for education and for every child reaching his or her potential,” the family’s statement said. “The fund will ensure that children have access to books that strengthen their literacy skills and [be dedicated] to the support of a community that believes in them, values Cynthia held closely to her heart.”
Hurd’s wake is due to be held on Friday, with her funeral on Saturday. The library service said that all 16 of Charleston’s public library branches will close on Saturday, in her honour and to allow staff to attend the funeral services.

 "Senator Pinckney was a brilliant young pastor and leader who always possessed an empowering and healing message," his alma mater, Allen University in Columbia, said in a statement. 


 Several witnesses remembered Pinckney for his dedication to helping others. 


 "He was a sweet person," said community member Lisa Doctor. "He was just a kind-hearted man."

 Another community member at the scene, J. Denise Cromwell, said the pastor had died while "trying to bring together a people for peace." 


 Tywanza Sanders 


 Sanders, 26, was also a graduate of Allen University. He earned a degree in business administration last year. 


 The university remembered him as "a quiet, well known student who was committed to his education. He presented a warm and helpful spirit as he interacted with his colleagues."

 Nai Chaganty, a college friend of Sanders, said she first met him when she dropped her wallet on the street and chased her to return it. 


 After they became friends, Chaganty said Sanders was there for her when she had a car accident driving from Virginia to see her husband. He helped her "hold onto faith" as she questioned God about what happened, she told NBC News. 


 "He would give you the clothes off his back," Chaganty said as she teared up. "He is a great person."

Cynthia Hurd, 54. 
 
Charleston County Public Library






 "It is unimaginable that she would walk into church and not return," Hurd's brother, former North Carolina state Sen. Malcolm Graham, said in a statement. "But that's who she was — a woman of faith. This is a very difficult time for our family, and Cynthia will be sorely missed." 


 All of the county's 16 branches were closed Thursday in her honor, and Charleston County Council member Elliott Summey said the St. Andrews library would be renamed the Cynthia Hurd Regional Library. 


 "We think that's a fitting honor for her, for someone who spent 31 years in our community, and it's the very least we can do for someone who was a true public servant," he said.

 Doctor, 49, was a church singer and former Charleston County community development block grant employee, retiring in 2005. 


 Doctor was a big part of the county's services for the poor, Summey said, helping to "fix roofs, and we help them with septic tanks and we do the human things that government's supposed to do." 


 "So in a very big way, she was doing very human, kindly things in our government for others," Summey said.

 Ethel Lance 


 Lance, 70, a sexton and lifelong member at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, found gratification by keeping the church tidy, according to her daughter, Esther. "If she saw a scuff on the floor she'd say, 'Oh no, don't y'all mess up my floor,'" Esther Lance told 
The Post and Courier
. 


 Esther Lance said after the the family suffered previous tragedies, including the loss of Esther's father and sister, her mother was consistently the "strong woman who just tried to keep her family together." 


 Lance is survived by three other children "and a host of grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins and friends," according to her 
obituary
. 


 Susie Jackson 


 Jackson, 87, a longtime member of the church, sang in the choir. She was the cousin of Lance, who was also killed during the bible study, according to 
her obituary
 


 The Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr. 


 Simmons Sr., 74, a member of the church's ministerial staff, died in the operating room at the hospital. 


 Myra Thompson
