THE BRONX (PIX11)–
 A teenager was shot and killed in the Bronx Friday morning, and now police are looking for two suspects.


Gunfire erupted around 8:30 a.m. as 14-year-old Christopher Duran was walking near his home at 1181 Sheridan Ave. in the Concourse section of the Bronx, police said.

Duran was struck three in the stomach and once in the head after an argument with two men. The teen was pronounced dead at the scene.


Sources tell PIX11 the shooting may have been gang-related.


One suspect was described as black or dark-skinned Hispanic man, wearing all black,  and the second was described as a male Hispanic wearing a light colored hooded sweatshirt with dark sleeves, blue jeans and a red bandana covering his face. Police released an image of the second suspect, below.
