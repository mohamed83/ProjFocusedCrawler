Movie theater chain fires girl for Twitter rant after deadly SC church shooting

A movie theater chain has fired a woman who allegedly posted a racially-charged Twitter rant right after the deadly church shooting in South Carolina.
“Don’t complain about being a minority and saying whites are the problem when your ancestors chose to come here knowing they would be a minority,” wrote a Twitter user named Hyley DiBona.

The remarks came just after nine people were shot and killed at a historically black Charleston, S.C., church on Wednesday.
Twitter users found a photo of DiBona wearing a nametag from Regal Entertainment Group and later contacted her employer.


The company posted a statement to Twitter saying the Twitter user had violated everything they stand for. Multiple news outlets are reporting that she’s been fired.
