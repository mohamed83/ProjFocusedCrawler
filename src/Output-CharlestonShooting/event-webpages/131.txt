 Long before police say Dylann Roof massacred nine people at a Charleston, South Carolina, church this week, his relatives recall he was a "sweet kid" who grew into a "painfully shy" loner. 


 But along the way, they told NBC News, he became ensnared by something sinister online. 


 "He was locked in his room looking up bad stuff on his computer," Roof's ex-stepmother, Paige Mann, said she had heard from his mother. "Something on the computer drew him in — this is Internet evil," she said Saturday from her home in Chapin, South Carolina.

 Mann described her former stepson as "very smart — too smart," and said that he was "bored in advanced classes" in school.

 Mann said Roof also had some obsessive tendencies like germaphobia, and maintained a bowl cut that she first gave him when he was 3. 


 "He would fixate on things. His dad tried to help him. His mother tried to help him. We all really tried to help him," she said.

 Mann and Roof's father, Ben, are divorced, but she said he and Roof's mother were concerned about him and urged him to get a job. 


 But the family didn't see warning signs that he would commit such a brutal act, mostly because Roof was a "sweet kid," Mann said. She said she released a childhood photo of Roof to NBC News because "I just want to show you that he had a good family."

No Plans for Tighter Security at Des Moines Church Following Charleston Shooting

DES MOINES, Iowa — “We serve a God who protects us. We don’t have to live in fear.”
Reverend Fredrick Gaddy of St. Paul AME Church said that before dozens of people at prayer vigil on Friday to remember the victims of the Charleston church shooting.
Around 100 people attended the vigil at the church, some of them hesitant to attend the event.
“I started not to come. I was very bitter and angry at the person,” said Sandi Fowler. “I came here distraught now I’m leaving with hope. I’m glad I came, she said.
St. Paul AME Church has been apart of Des Moines’ faith community for more than a century. Reverand Gaddy says the church has never receieved any hatred but instead has worked to bring the community together.
As a result of Thursday’s violence he said he does not feel his church will be targeted. There are no security measures in place at the church and Gaddy does not plan on implementing anything new.
“We won’t let evil change what we’ve been doing for over 100 years. We are supposed to welcome the strangers.”
Gaddy preached a sermon of encouragement and urged the congreation to recommit themselves in the fight for justice.
Church member, AJ Singleton said, ” We can’t let this  take us off our path. We need to continue to pray and keep fighting.”
Community leaders hope the incident will propel higher intensity and discussions regarding race.
“A lot of times we have race relation discussions  with folks of our own race. We need to bring people together and we need to continue to talk how we can eradicate hate towards races of people,” said Renee Hardman.

 "I never imagined he'd have anything bad in his heart toward people," Mann's mother, Patricia Hastings, told NBC News. 


 "Ben comes from a very good family, very well-educated, from church-going, God-loving people who would never condone or teach this to their children. I don't know when Dylann got lost," Hastings said, adding that the family is getting death threats.

 "We're just in shock. We can't comprehend any of it," she added. 


 Both Hastings and Mann expressed sorrow for the nine lives that were lost during Wednesday's shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Roof's family also 
released a statement expressing their condolences Friday night.
 


 Mann said she last saw Roof a month ago, and recalled something was strange: He showed an uncharacteristic display of affection. "He gave me a big hug," she said, "and that makes me feel like he was telling me goodbye."
