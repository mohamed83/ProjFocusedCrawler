Police looking for 3 suspects in home invasion


 


ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – St. Louis police are searching for two suspects in a home invasion and robbery that happened early Monday morning on Lucas. The victim says he had invited a woman to his residence, but another woman showed up. She held the door open for two men to enter. One pulled out a gun and forced the victim inside. The suspects took some items and took off. The suspects are described as African-American males, with one wearing a black t-shirt and the other with tattoos on his face.
