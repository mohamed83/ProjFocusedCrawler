CHICAGO (STMW)
 — Two West Side men have been charged with several offenses in relation to a police-involved shooting in the Northwest Side Hermosa neighborhood early Monday.


About 1:15 a.m. Monday, Grand Central Gang Enforcement officers were on a mission near the intersection of North Keeler and West Armitage avenues when they saw a suspect inside a vehicle point a handgun at a group of people before the vehicle drove off, according to a statement from police News Affairs.


Officers later stopped the same vehicle in the 2000 block of North Kostner Avenue before a male suspect exited the automobile and pointed a handgun at police, the statement said.


Officers chased the suspect on foot into a yard, where he again pointed the gun at police — prompting officers to discharge their weapons, striking the suspect, according to the statement.


The suspect, who did not fire shots at police, was taken into custody and brought to an area hospital, the statement said.


No officers were hurt and a handgun was recovered, the statement said.


The man with the gun, Jonathan Pena, 20, of the 3400 block of West North Avenue, was charged with: theft of lost or mislaid property; unlawful possession of firearm by a street gang member; unlawful use of a weapon; aggravated assault of a police officer with a firearm, and failure to appear on a warrant out of Cook County, a release Tuesday from police said.


Additionally, Sylvester Jimenez, 28, of the 1000 block of North Spaulding, was charged with: four counts of failure to stop at a stop sign, two counts of failure to yield to vehicle entering intersection; driving the wrong way on a one-way street; fleeing/attempting to elude police, and aggravated fleeing, the release said.


Court information was not immediately available Tuesday afternoon.

HIGH POINT, N.C. — Churches around the country have been holding prayer vigils in the wake of last Wednesday’s shooting massacre where nine people were killed during bible study in Charleston.
Pastor Kinston Jones, of St. Stephen Metropolitan AME Zion Church, says along with spiritual support, his church is also trying to help show financial support to the victims’ families.
Since the shooting, Jones has been organizing a worship service where he is inviting all churches in High Point.
Money raised through the collection will go towards the victims’ families.
Jones is also starting a special Sunday offering to add to the fund.
“Money will not be able to take away the pain,” Jones said. “But if the families know that they have support, spiritual support and brothers and sisters that will be there for them after the burial of loved ones, I think it can certainly encourage them and help to know that someone is in the fight with them.”
The worship service entitled Unity in the Community will be held at St. Stephen at 6 p.m. June 30.
All proceeds will go towards the Charleston, S.C., Mother Emmanuel AME Church Hope Fund.
