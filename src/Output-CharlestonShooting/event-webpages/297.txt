Anthony Altick
ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI)- A St. Louis man has been charged with murder after a weekend shooting in south city left one man dead and two others injured. Anthony Altick, 27, is in custody. Police say he`s responsible for a triple shooting that happened on Saturday morning at an apartment building on Jamieson and Delor, in St. Louis Hills. Authorities say Altick and at least one of the victims knew each other and the shooting does not appear to be random. Altick was inside of his apartment building and the victims were outside. Investigators say a door was damaged and several shots were fired, striking several victims.
Darryl Simms, 27, of East St. Louis, was killed. A 25 year-old man was shot in the torso. He is in critical condition. A 24 year-old suffered gunshot wounds to his arm and side. He is in serious condition.
Police say a fourth victim ran from the scene.
Now, Altick is charged with 1st degree murder, 2 counts of 1st degree assault, and 3 counts of armed criminal action. He`s being held in the St. Louis City Justice Center with a $750,000 cash-only bond.
This is not Altick`s first run-in with the law. Within the past three years, he has been charged with DWI, burglary, theft, receiving stolen property and he had a protection order filed against him, for stalking.
