FERGUSON, MO (KTVI) – An arrest has been made in connection with the fatal shooting of a 9-year-old in Ferguson.  Ferguson police worked with St. Louis County police and the US Marshals office to arrest De’Eris Brown, 21, at a hospital on Wednesday.  Brown was not a patient at the hospital. He was there to see a family member.


According to the probable cause statement he is charged with unlawful use of a weapon, armed criminal action and murder in the second degree. Bond has been set at $750,000.


Ferguson police identified the suspect because of a tip called into investigators.  A witness identified Brown as the shooter. An informant came forward saying the suspect admitted he shot into the home. Investigators say the suspect confessed to the shooting after being taken into custody at the hospital.


Jamyla Bolden was shot and killed on Tuesday August 18th in her home in the 9200 block of Ellison Drive. She was lying on her mother’s bed, doing her homework. Bolden’s mother suffered a gunshot wound to the leg as well.


Visitation services for Bolden will be held at Layne Renaissance Chapel on West Florissant Avenue on Friday from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. A second visitation will be held at Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church the following day at 9 a.m., with the funeral to follow at 11 a.m.


A reward of $8,265 was offered to find the killer. Anyone with more information on the case should call CrimeStoppers at 866-371-TIPS.


More details will be posted as this story develops.  Refresh this page for the latest update.
