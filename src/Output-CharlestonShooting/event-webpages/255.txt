Local AME church remembers South Carolina victims

GREENSBORO, N.C. — Members of Bethel AME Church in Greensboro are relying on their religion.


They are trying to overcome the shock, terror and pain they’ve experienced following the massacre of nine black people at a South Carolina church.


It’s the first Sunday following the shooting at Emanuel AME Church in South Carolina. Churches nationwide honored the victims.


“What was meant for evil in Charleston, as in so many other places, God is going to turn it for the good,” said Rev. Alphonso McGlen of Bethel AME Church.


McGlen organized a candlelight memorial between services on Sunday. Nine of his members displayed pictures of the men and women who were killed, and burned a candle in their memory.


Mozell N. Weston, who was at the memorial, grew up in South Carolina and was a member of the church where the shooting happened. She said participating in the special service will help her heal.


Officials said Dylann Roof, who is in custody, admitted to shooting the victims because he wanted to start a race war. Members of Bethel AME Church prayed for Roof’s family but also addressed the pain he has caused for people across the country.


“It ranges from anger, to fear for many and just still shocked… that this could still occur… for the reasons it occurred, in 2015,” McGlen said.
