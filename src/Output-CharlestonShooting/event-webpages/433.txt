RALEIGH, N.C. — Raleigh police are looking for a suspect or suspects involved in a deadly shooting.
Police said just before 11 p.m. Saturday night, officers responded to reports of shots being fired in the 1400 block of Collegeview Avenue, not far from North Carolina State’s campus.
When officers arrived on scene they found one man with non-life-threatening injuries, 23-year-old Daniel Deleon Pittman of Raleigh.
They also found 18-year-old Irvin Adan Gonzalez-Martinez, also of Raleigh, dead.
“He was a fun person to be around he would joke around a lot and have fun,” said Javier Morales, a childhood friend of Gonzalez-Martinez.
