ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – St. Louis city police were called into action just after 6 pm Monday night. Officers arrived at the 5600 block of Goodfellow after a St. Louis city police officer was hit in his cruiser by the driver of a black 4 door Dodge. Police have also confirmed that car which had front end damage was stolen. There were multiple units in the area canvassing looking for the driver on foot. Then less than a mile away at Floy and Lenora Avenues police caught the suspect and took him into custody. Police also questioned two women on the scene and took evidence including fingerprints, electronics and bags from the car. The whole incident was wrapped up with that car being towed away by 7:30 pm. At this point there`s no word on where or why that car was stolen.
