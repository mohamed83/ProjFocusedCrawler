(Kevin A. Allen, aka Kevin Hall)


LYNDHURST, N.J. —
 The Bergen County Prosecutor says a 36-year-old Lyndhurst man, Kevin K. Allen, also was known as Kevin Hall, was shot and killed by Lyndhurst Police this afternoon.


Two Lyndhurst Police officers responded to the town’s public library around 1:35 p.m. Shots were fired on the third floor. Allen was hit and police say he died at an area hospital. No police officers were hurt, but the two officers involved in the shooting were sent to the hospital for trauma.


Police say people who witnessed the shooting, including a minor, were interviewed on Friday afternoon.


The Prosecutor and Lyndhurst Police did not release information as of Friday afternoon as to why police were called or why shots were fired.


A witness on Twitter reports that he saw police run into the library with their guns drawn.
