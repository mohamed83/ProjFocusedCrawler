NEW YORK (PIX11) –
 One of the suspects wanted in the May 22 fatal shooting of a 14-year-old boy in front of his Bronx building is under arrest, police said Monday.


Travis Bloch, 28, was on the run after he allegedly opened fire on Christopher Duran as the boy walked out of 1174 Sheridan Avenue, killing him with three bullets to the abdomen and head.  Surveillance cameras captured the entire shooting.


Officers arrested Bloch in Binghamton after they stopped him for allegedly selling marijuana.  Bloch faces charges of murder, manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon.


Police are still looking for the second suspect, identified as 16-year-old Jeremiah Thomas, also known as “Jay.”  Police said the video shows the two suspects, faces obscured by bandannas and hoodies, run up to Duran and shoot him in the face at point blank range.

Police sources told PIX11 the shooting could have been connected with either gang activity or a previous conflict among groups in the neighborhood.  Duran had a rap sheet that included arrests for robbery, assault and possession of a knife.Duran was pronounced dead in front of the apartment building where his family lived at 1181 Sheridan Ave. in the Concourse section of the Bronx.


Police are asking anyone has information on the whereabouts of Jeremiah Thomas to call the anonymous police tip line Crime  Stoppers at 800-577-TIPS (8477).  Police describe him as a black male, 16 years old, roughly 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 170 pounds.
