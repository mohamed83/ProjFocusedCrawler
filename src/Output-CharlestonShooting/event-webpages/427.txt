SOUTH SACRAMENTO-
The Sacramento Police Department is investigating a shooting and multiple vehicle crash near 65th Street and Stockton Boulevard.
Witnesses said it started with two cars chasing after a third. At least five vehicles were involved in the crash.
Police believe the incident may have started as an altercation at a nearby memorial service. That argument continued as gunshots were fired from vehicles that were traveling down the street.
Not all of the vehicles involved in the crash were involved in the original confrontation or shooting.
The CHP and the Sacramento Sheriff’s Department are assisting in the investigation.
A pregnant woman and her husband who were in one of the vehicles were taken to the hospital. No word on their condition.
