CHARLESTON, S.C. — Charleston’s Mayor Joseph P. Riley, Jr. has set up “Mother Emanuel Hope” fund at Wells Fargo bank.


The city has already pledged $5,000. The fund will help family members pay for funerals, counseling and other financial needs.


Donations can be made by walking into any of Wells Fargo’s 6,200 banking locations. An online portal to donate will be live soon, but for now you can make a check out to “Mother Emanuel Hope Fund” and send it to the address below:


Mother Emanuel Hope Fund


C/O City of Charleston


P.O. Box 304 Charleston, SC 29402.


Honoring the victims


Emanuel AME, a pillar in the Charleston community, is the oldest AME church in the south. Religious leaders, of all faiths, are calling for prayers in honor of the victims.


“I pray that everyone affected by this horror will feel the comforting presence of our Lord surrounding them during this difficult time,” said Bishop Robert E. Guglielmone of the Diocese of Charleston on Thursday.


Richard Norris, the Bishop of the affected district of the AME Church has called for prayer amongst believers across South Carolina.


“This is not only a tragedy for Emanuel and not only a tragedy for the AME church, but it is a tragedy for the nation,” said John Richard Bryant, Bishop of the Fourth District of the AME Church.


The church pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who is also a state senator, was killed while delivering a sermon. Those who knew him say he was a peacemaker.


Social media is a buzz with memories and announcements of vigils honoring the victims.


Myra Thompson, who was killed while teaching the Bible study class at Emanuel, was a woman who loved the Lord, according to those who knew her.


“Her every objective was to please him in all that she did. She was teaching Bible study when she was killed,” said Bishop Alphonza Gadsden.


The Rev. Sharonda Singleton, a speech therapist and track coach at Goose Creek High School, is being remembered with a “Night of Prayer”


Cynthia Hurd, an employee of Charleston County Public Library for 31 years was also killed in the shooting. In a post made by the library on Facebook, a two day closure was announced in her memory.

They call it Mother Emanuel. Home to the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, South Carolina, has been a key part of the rich history of the American south, from slave revolts in the early 19th century to the civil rights movement.

“Where you are is a very special place in Charleston,” the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the attack on the church on Wednesday, told a group of doctoral students in 2013. “This site, this area, has been tied to the history and life of African Americans since the early 1800s.”
On Wednesday evening a new, bleak chapter in this rich history was written, when Pinckney and eight congregants were gunned down in cold blood at a basement Bible-study class.
The attack, which police are calling a hate crime, carries troubling echoes of the past.
“If [the shooter] was a white supremacist then he’s picked a target that’s incredibly symbolic in the black community. He’s hit at the very heart of it,” said Tim Lockley, a professor of American history at Warwick University who specialises in race relations.
Mother Emanuel was born into an era of violence. In 1822, just four years after the first church was built, a freed slave and carpenter named Denmark Vesey, one of the founders of the Emanuel church, was the ringleader of a vast planned slave insurrection known as “the rising”.

Vesey and his alleged co-conspirators were betrayed and rounded up by Charleston authorities. The city convened a secret kangaroo court, and he and 34 others were swiftly hanged. Thirty more were deported, and white supremacists burned the old wooden church to the ground.
In 1834, the city of Charleston banned all-black churches. The congregation of Emanuel, which had been rebuilt since the Vesey trials, were forced to meet in secret until the end of the civil war.
After reconstruction, the congregation began to grow, and its importance for the black Christian community in Charleston grew along with it.

Booker T Washington spoke there in 1909; Dr Martin Luther King’s gave a speech at Emanuel there urging congregants to vote in 1962. In 1969, almost exactly a year after King’s death, his widow Coretta Scott King led a protest to the church; 900 were arrested by the national guard.
Barack Obama said on Thursdau that he and his wife Michelle knew members of the Emanuel congregation, and that they knew the Rev Pinckney.
“Mother Emanuel is in fact more than a church,” the president said. “This is a place of worship that was founded by African-Americans seeking liberty. This is a church that was burned to the ground because its worshippers worked to end slavery.” 
“This is a sacred place in the history of Charleston, and the history of America,” he said.
Mother Emanuel has seen death, cruelty and despair. In his speech to the doctoral candidates, Pinckney said that the church was a “beacon, and a bearer of the culture, and a bearer of what makes us people”. Like America, he said, it was about freedom. “Freedom to worship … freedom to be all God intends you to be,” he said. “Sometimes you gotta make noise to do that.
“Sometimes,” he said, “you maybe have to die, like Denmark Vesey, to do that.”
