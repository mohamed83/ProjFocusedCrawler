ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – St. Louis police are looking for an African-American male in connection to a stolen debit card. Police say the suspect stole a wallet that contained a debit card from a female victim in a robbery Monday night on Russell.
The victim stated the suspect walked up to her while she was sitting in a car smoking a cigarette and asked if he could a cigarette. She gave the man a cigarette and he then pressed a handgun to her head demanding money. She gave the suspect her wallet and he fled the scene.
Anyone who recognizes these individuals is asked to call CrimeStoppers at 866-371-TIPS (8477). Please broadcast.
The woman in the pictures is not considered a suspect.
