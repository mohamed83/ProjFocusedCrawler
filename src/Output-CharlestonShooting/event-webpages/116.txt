GREENSBORO, N.C. — Police have yet to find the weapon used to shoot a man in the leg at least twice on a wild afternoon in the Pomona neighborhood near West Wendover Avenue Friday.


It started around 4 p.m. when police were called to a motor vehicle accident in which a car ran into a home on Hewitt Street.


Police said the people involved in that crash were also involved in an attempted armed robbery at Clifton Road and Rucker Street just a few moments before.


Police believe the people inside the car ran off on foot and were also involved in the shooting on Cranbrook Street.


“I heard the five shots I thought, ‘Lord someone might be getting shot and killed,’” said Richard Welborn, who was walking to the store when he heard the gunfire.


Welborn said he ducked for cover behind a home and the next thing he saw were several police cars swarm the neighborhood.


Witnesses said police arriving on the scene for the wreck also heard the gunshots and started blocking several streets immediately.


“All these appear to be one incident just spread out in the span of three minutes or less in this three-block area,” said Captain Mike Richey with the Greensboro Police Department.


Police questioned several people at the scene and put some into the back of patrol vehicles but have yet to identify any suspects in the shooting or attempted armed robbery.


“We’re getting a lot of different stories a lot of detectives a lot of officers collecting the stories so we’ll come back in we’ll put them together to see what really happened,” said Richey.


Richey said no police officers fired any shots and couldn’t say if all the gunfire came from one gun or more.


Police believe they are looking for two or three people who were involved in the attempted armed robbery, hit and run and shooting.
