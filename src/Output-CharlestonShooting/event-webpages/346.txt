MODESTO-
A man in Modesto is in critical condition Monday morning after being shot multiple times by Modesto police officers.
Officers said they opened fire after the suspect initially shot at them after short chase that began on H and 8th Streets and ended at I Street at Downey Avenue.
Modesto police say they originally got a call around 11:30 p.m. about a fight and that someone may be armed. Those suspects, three in total, took off in the green car. Investigators say officers used a PIT maneuver stop them.
No officers were hit in the gunfire exchange. Modesto police would only say the suspect is in critical condition, and would not say if his injuries were life-threatening.
The other two suspects have been arrested.
