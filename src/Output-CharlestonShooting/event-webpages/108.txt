'I forgive you': Charleston church victims' families confront suspect

>>>>>>> origin/master




<<<<<<< HEAD
WARREN, N.J.– Two people were killed after an hours long standoff with police Sunday afternoon, according to authorities.


The suspect shot and killed a man and a woman before touching off a 6 hour manhunt, said Captain Jack Bennett of the Somerset County prosecutor’s office.


The suspect then died of apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, he said.


Police didn’t give any more details of the shootings.


This is an active and ongoing investigation.
