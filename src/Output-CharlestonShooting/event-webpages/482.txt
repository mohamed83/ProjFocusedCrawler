ROSEVILLE —
A suspect on a crime spree is caught doing the same thing not once, but twice, according to police.
According to the Roseville Police Department, a suspicious man was reported riding a bike on the 1600 block of Soledad Drive on May 27.
That suspect turned out to be 28-year-old Pavel Ustimchuk, who was detained by officers.
Another officer found a woman inside a pickup truck, and upon searching the vehicle, found another bike, drugs including heroin and methamphetamine, burglar’s tools and suspected stolen property including credit cards.
Ustimchuk and the woman from Rio Linda were arrested on suspicion of theft, drug possession and other charges, according to the Roseville Police Department.
Ann Sokolsky, who lives in the area Ustimchuk hit first, said she moved to the neighborhood because she thought it was safe, but now she has concerns.
“Just to know that something like that happened to you it’s a little nerve rattling,” she said.
That wasn’t the end of Ustimchuk’s alleged crime spree.
He was released on $60,000 bond on June 3, after being slapped with additional charges of being an ex-felon in possession of a stolen firearm and ammunition, and just nine days later was caught in the act again, police said.
This time he was in a grocery store parking lot at Woodcreek Oaks Boulevard and Pleasant Grove Boulevard.
“We detained him and found pretty much the same stuff we found the first time,” said Dee Dee Gunther, public information officer with the Roseville Police Department.
Ustimchuk is being held at the Placer County Jail on $70,000 bail and is facing several charges including vehicle theft, possession of drugs and possession of burglar’s tools and for allegedly committing a felony while out on bail.
Proposition 47 played a role in the drug charges Ustimchuk is currently facing. Those charges were lowered from felonies to misdemeanors.
