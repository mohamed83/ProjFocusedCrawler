The suspect in the mass shooting of nine church leaders at Bible study in one of America’s oldest black congregations has been charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, police say. 


Dylann Storm Roof has reportedly confessed to carrying out the shootings at Emanuel AME church on Wednesday night. 
CNN is reporting
 that it has been told by two law enforcement officials that Roof has told authorities that he was the shooter. NBC 
reported the same
. The Guardian cannot confirm this.


According to the CNN account, the 21-year-old resident of Columbia, 
South Carolina
, said that his motive had been that he wanted to start a race war.


Roof is being held at the Al Cannon detention center in North Charleston. A bond hearing has been scheduled for Friday afternoon, though Roof is likely to appear by video link rather than in person.


Nikki Haley, the governor of South Carolina, told NBC News on Friday that she wanted Roof to face a capital prosecution. “We will absolutely want him to have the death penalty,” she said.


Authorities said that Roof was being kept in isolation away from other people at the jail. He was also being kept on suicide watch for his own protection, they said.


New questions were also emerging about how Roof acquired the firearm that he allegedly used in the attack at the historic African American Emanuel AME church. 


Relatives have indicated that he was given a Glock handgun by his father in April as a birthday present, but CNN law enforcement officials familiar with the details said that he had told officers that he bought a gun recently from a gun shop.

South Carolina ex-police officer indicted in Walter Scott killing

South Carolina ex-police officer indicted in Walter Scott killing


 Michael Slager.



South Carolina prosecutor Scarlett Wilson said Monday that a grand jury has indicted former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager on a murder charge.
Slager is accused of shooting and killing motorist Walter Scott. In April, Slager pulled Scott over, reportedly for a faulty brake light. Video released showed the men talking then Scott getting out of his vehicle and running away.
According to a police report, Scott, a 50-year-old African-American man, did not comply with an officer’s demands and tried to grab Slager’s stun gun. Slager is white.
A widely circulated video taken by a bystander with a phone shows Scott attempting to run. His back is to Slager, who, from a few yards away, raises his gun and fires.
Slager shot eight times, and Scott was hit five times. Scott died at the scene.
Slager was fired from the department, arrested and charged with murder.
Slager’s attorney, Andy Savage, told CNN Monday that his defense team has not yet been given prosecutors’ investigative materials as requested and would not comment on “any aspect” of the case until they have that information.
