South Carolina ex-police officer indicted in Walter Scott killing


 Michael Slager.



South Carolina prosecutor Scarlett Wilson said Monday that a grand jury has indicted former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager on a murder charge.
Slager is accused of shooting and killing motorist Walter Scott. In April, Slager pulled Scott over, reportedly for a faulty brake light. Video released showed the men talking then Scott getting out of his vehicle and running away.
According to a police report, Scott, a 50-year-old African-American man, did not comply with an officer’s demands and tried to grab Slager’s stun gun. Slager is white.
A widely circulated video taken by a bystander with a phone shows Scott attempting to run. His back is to Slager, who, from a few yards away, raises his gun and fires.
Slager shot eight times, and Scott was hit five times. Scott died at the scene.
Slager was fired from the department, arrested and charged with murder.
Slager’s attorney, Andy Savage, told CNN Monday that his defense team has not yet been given prosecutors’ investigative materials as requested and would not comment on “any aspect” of the case until they have that information.
