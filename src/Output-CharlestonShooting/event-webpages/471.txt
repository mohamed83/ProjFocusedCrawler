ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI)- Police are searching for a robber they say pulled a gun out on two people in downtown St. Louis overnight.
Authorities are keeping their eyes peeled for that suspect, who they say may still be armed. Police say around 12:45a.m., a woman was walking near 1200 Olive Street when they say a man stole her purse. Another man, who witnessed the incident, jumped in and tried to help her.
That’s when authorities say the suspect pulled out a gun and was able to take off with the stolen purse.
Fortunately no shots were fired and no one was injured.
