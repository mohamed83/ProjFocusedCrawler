A grand jury voted not to file charges against two police officers for fatally shooting a man in 
New Jersey
 who defied orders by stepping out of a car with his hands raised during a traffic stop, a killing captured by their patrol car’s dashboard camera, prosecutors said Thursday.


The officers told investigators that they feared for their lives during the December 2014 stop of 36-year-old Jerame Reid, according to a statement from the Cumberland county prosecutor’s office. The officers had arrested Reid in August 2014 on charges of resisting arrest and knew he had served about 13 years in prison after being convicted as a teenager of shooting at state troopers, investigators said.

Screaming repeatedly “Don’t you f--ing move!” and “Show me your hands!” at Reid, who was sitting in the passenger seat, Officer Braheme Days reached into the car and removed a handgun. 


“I’m going to shoot you!” Days shouts, at one point addressing Reid by his first name. “If you reach for something, you’re going to be f--ing dead.” 


Days tells his partner, “He’s reaching for something.” 


Faintly on the video, Reid can be heard telling the officer: “I ain’t doing nothing. I’m not reaching for nothing, bro. I ain’t got no reason to reach for nothing.” 


The video shows Reid getting out of the car with his hands up, but Days who was holding both his service weapon and the recovered gun told investigators that he believed Reid “had a weapon or was planning to take the handgun(s) out of his hands.” 


The statement from prosecutors said Days “perceived that he and his partner were in imminent danger” and that his partner, Officer Roger Worley, “likewise believed that his partner was in imminent danger.” 


Prosecutors say Days fired seven shots and Worley fired once. The shooting lasted approximately 2 seconds and Reid was hit in the chest and left arm, according to prosecutors. Days is black, Worley is white and Reid was black. 


The announcement that no charges would be filed comes amid national scrutiny of police dealings with African-Americans, especially those killed by officers. 


Cumberland County First Assistant Prosecutor Harold Shapiro said the grand jury was instructed on potential criminal charges against the officers and the state’s rules for justified force. On Wednesday, the jurors declined to indict the officers.


Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McCrae recused herself because she knew Days. 


Bridgeton police Chief Michael Gaimari said the officers remain on paid administrative leave pending consultation with prosecutors and city officials. Noting the department’s respect for Reid’s family, he said the department supports the actions of the officers. 


“No police officer wants any incident to end with any loss of life, including their own. Officers must make split-second decisions routinely and unfortunately, at times, those decisions can be fatal,” he said in a statement. 


The shooting in Bridgeton, where two-thirds of the residents are black or Hispanic, stirred protests and opened up a rift between the police department and residents in the struggling city of 25,000 people about 35 miles south of Philadelphia.

Walter Hudson, chairman of the National Awareness Alliance, which has organized protests in Bridgeton over the shooting, said the group was disappointed but not surprised by the grand jury’s decision. He said the group will ask the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate. 


“What is surprising about this case is the fact it took this long to arrive at an already preconceived idea to not indict police officers,” Hudson said. “The culture of policing in America clearly shows we must push for police reform.” 


Reid’s widow, Lawanda, filed a $1 million federal civil rights lawsuit accusing the city of condoning excessive force by its officers. She also reached a tentative settlement against the county for $340,000 for abuse Jerame Reid had earlier said he suffered in prison. 


“I’m disgusted,” Lawanda Reid told NJ.com on Thursday. “I’m embarrassed to be a citizen of Bridgeton.”

How to help support victims’ families in South Carolina church shooting that killed nine


 Cynthia Hurd.


CHARLESTON, S.C. — Charleston’s Mayor Joseph P. Riley, Jr. has set up “Mother Emanuel Hope” fund at Wells Fargo bank.
The city has already pledged $5,000. The fund will help family members pay for funerals, counseling and other financial needs.
Donations can be made by walking into any of Wells Fargo’s 6,200 banking locations. An online portal to donate will be live soon, but for now you can make a check out to “Mother Emanuel Hope Fund” and send it to the address below:
Mother Emanuel Hope Fund
C/O City of Charleston
P.O. Box 304 Charleston, SC 29402.
Honoring the victims
Emanuel AME, a pillar in the Charleston community, is the oldest AME church in the south. Religious leaders, of all faiths, are calling for prayers in honor of the victims.
“I pray that everyone affected by this horror will feel the comforting presence of our Lord surrounding them during this difficult time,” said Bishop Robert E. Guglielmone of the Diocese of Charleston on Thursday.
Richard Norris, the Bishop of the affected district of the AME Church has called for prayer amongst believers across South Carolina.
“This is not only a tragedy for Emanuel and not only a tragedy for the AME church, but it is a tragedy for the nation,” said John Richard Bryant, Bishop of the Fourth District of the AME Church.
The church pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who is also a state senator, was killed while delivering a sermon. Those who knew him say he was a peacemaker.
Social media is a buzz with memories and announcements of vigils honoring the victims.
Myra Thompson, who was killed while teaching the Bible study class at Emanuel, was a woman who loved the Lord, according to those who knew her.
“Her every objective was to please him in all that she did. She was teaching Bible study when she was killed,” said Bishop Alphonza Gadsden.
The Rev. Sharonda Singleton, a speech therapist and track coach at Goose Creek High School, is being remembered with a “Night of Prayer”
Cynthia Hurd, an employee of Charleston County Public Library for 31 years was also killed in the shooting. In a post made by the library on Facebook, a two day closure was announced in her memory.
