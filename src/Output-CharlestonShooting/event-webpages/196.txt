CHICAGO (STMW)
 — Chicago police shot a person allegedly carrying a gun Monday night on the South Side.


Police responded about 8 p.m. to a report of a person with a gun near East 64th Street and South St. Lawrence Avenue, police said.


It isn’t immediately known what happened next, but an officer shot a suspect, police said.


Paramedics took one trauma patient to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County and another person to University of Chicago Hospital in fair condition with an unidentified injury, Fire Media Affairs spokesman Kevin MacGregor said.


Area Central detectives and the Independent Police Review Authority are investigating.
