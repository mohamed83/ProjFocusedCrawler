Charleston, S.C., photographer Austin Rich was arrested for the shooting at AME Church before being released.
 
 
 
 

	A Charleston, S.C., photographer unwittingly became part of the city’s horror story Wednesday night, getting publicly arrested in the midst of the manhunt for the suspect who 
shot nine people dead
 at a black church.




EMANUEL AME CHURCH HAS LONG HISTORY, TIES TO SLAVE REBELLION



	Austin Rich was cuffed near the scene of the massacre, causing a brief social media uproar as some believed him to be the murderous madman. Local media never identified him as a suspect.



	Rich was released before midnight, and the real suspect remains on the run early Thursday morning.

Rich had been taking pictures at a gas station near the church.
 
 
 







	“Tonight as many of you may already know I was detained as a suspect for the shooting that took place In downtown Charleston,” Rich wrote in a 
Facebook post
 after his release.



	“I want to assure everyone that I am safe and innocent.”



	White was taking pictures at a gas station close to the Mother Emanuel AME Church when news of the bloodbath broke, he said.




CHARLESTON CHURCH KILLER WENT ON RACIST RANT BEFORE SHOOTING



	He wrote on Facebook that he was “mistaken as the shooter because of my grey t-shirt” —a detail that matched the description of the suspect.



	“The officers rushed over to handcuff me,” he wrote.

“I understand that the officers were simply doing their job and they did it well,” he added, noting he holds no grudge over the arrest.



	Rich said he was interviewing people for a daily photo project called “1,000 Days of Talking With Strangers,” similar to Brandon Stanton’s popular “Humans of New York” project, which Rich has cited as an influence.

	Rich did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and Charleston police have not commented on his arrest.

Police in Charleston, S.C., respond to the fatal shooting of nine people at a black church in a suspected hate crime Wednesday night.
 
 
 







	The shooting at the church, which calls itself the oldest AME church in the South, is reportedly one of the worst mass shootings in South Carolina’s history. Police described the suspect as a white, blond male in his early 20s, who was wearing a grey sweatshirt and blue jeans.
