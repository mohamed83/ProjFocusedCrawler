HOUSTON — A Houston attorney on the National Rifle Association’s board of directors is blaming the deadly Charleston church shooting on the slain pastor’s opposition to concealed carry legislation as a state senator.
Charles Cotton confirmed to The Associated Press that he wrote in an online post that “innocent people died” because of Clementa Pinckney’s opposition to the measure in the state Senate. A search of legislative archives could not immediately find any such measure.

The online post led to a firestorm of opposition, some asking for the removal of Cotton from his position.

The #NRA could actually be a force for good in this world. Instead they are just the most putrid example of a business lobby. #charlescotton

Nine people were killed Wednesday night after a 21-year-old gunman opened fire during a Bible study at The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.
Cotton told the AP he was expressing a personal opinion not reflective of the NRA. He said he was “stumped” his comments were still visible because he’d deleted them after deciding they were inappropriate.
