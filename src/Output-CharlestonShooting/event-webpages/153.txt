 A website featuring a 2,444-word white supremacist screed shows dozens of photos of the gunman arrested in the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre. 


 The site shows a stone-faced Dylann Roof — the man who confessed to shooting nine people dead at a Bible study group, according to sources — holding weapons, visiting a cemetery for Confederate soldiers, and burning and spitting on an American flag. 


 Roof appears to have bought the site domain in February based on a reverse domain look-up service that found it was registered under the name Dylann Roof, using Roof's mother's home address. NBC News could not confirm the site's authenticity or whether Roof was its creator.

 Federal law enforcement sources said the FBI and local Charleston authorities have been investigating and analyzing the site, and have known about it for several days. 


 While the FBI is not saying with "100 percent" certainty it belongs to Roof, they are operating under the assumption that he is responsible for all of the writings, photos and other material, sources said.

 There are also photos on it of historic sites, such as a Confederate museum, and one picture of a beach's coastline with "1488" carved in the sand, a white supremacy encryption that stands for: "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children." It's unclear who took many of the photos.

 In a drawn-out rant, the site's writer outlines becoming "racially aware," explaining that he wasn't raised in a racist environment, but was "awakened" by the case of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot to death in Florida.

Quick-thinking NC woman helps police nab suspect in SC church shooting that killed nine

KING’S MOUNTAIN, N.C. – The quick-thinking of one North Carolina woman helped police catch a man accused of killing nine people at a South Carolina church.
Debbie Dills got a bad feeling when she was driving into work Thursday morning.
Just after 10 a.m., something caught her eye as she was driving on Highway 74 near Shelby.
“I saw the back of his head,” Dills said. “And I saw that bowl cut, that hair.”
She called her boss at Frady’s Florist in Kings Mountain, about 15 miles outside Shelby.
“I think that I have just passed the car the boy was driving that killed the people in Charleston,” Dills remembered telling her boss.
Around 10:45 a.m., Shelby police caught and arrested 21-year-old Dylann Roof, accused of shooting and killing nine people at a Charleston church during Bible study Wednesday night.
“Once we got him in custody, we brought him here,” said Shelby Police Chief Jeff Ledford. “We notified Charleston to let them know we had their suspect.”
Dills said she had been thinking of the nine victims when she decided to call her boss and notify police.
“They were studying His word,” Dills said. “That’s what they were there to do and they lost their life doing that.”
“They can never come back,” Dills said. “But those families can find some kind of solace, some kind of peace and some kind of comfort in knowing that the young man is caught.”
Charleston County Coroner Rae Wooten identified the nine shooting victims as follows: Cynthia Hurd, 54; Susie Jackson, 87; Ethel Lance, 70; Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Hon. Rev. Clementa Pinckney, 41; Tywanza Sanders, 26; Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; Rev. Sharonda Singleton, 45; Myra Thompson, 59.

 The writer goes on to explain his views on race, calling black people "stupid and violent," Jewish people an "enigma," Hispanic people a "huge problem," and East Asian people "by nature very racist."

 The writer then describes a disdain for the American flag, which he says represents "people pretending like they have something to be proud [of] while White people are being murdered daily in the streets." The writer concludes by saying that he has no choice but to fight, and says he has chosen Charleston because of its historical importance and because it "at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country." 
















"1488," a numerical symbol popular with white supremacists, is carved in the sand in a photo posted to a website registered under the name of Dylann Roof.
 






 Roof, 21, was arrested in the fatal shootings of the nine victims at the historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston on Wednesday night. Police say they believe the attack was a hate crime.
