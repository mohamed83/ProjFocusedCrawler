STOCKTON–
Police in Stockton are investigating four shootings that happened Thursday. Two of the shootings were fatal.
South Grant Street
The first shooting happened shortly before 3:30 p.m. along South Grant Street in the Seaport District. Police say a man demanded the victim’s cell phone. When the victim refused, he was shot, police said.
The man was taken to a hospital.
Investigators describe the suspect as a Hispanic man in his early 20’s, about 5 feet 7 inches tall, between 140 and 160 pounds with short hair, a light complexion and a small goatee, last seen wearing a white t-shirt and dark denim shorts.
East Alpine Avenue
Police say a man was shot at 4 p.m. along East Alpine Avenue in the Civic District. According to investigators the man was accused by the suspect of doing “something” to a family member of the suspect, and shot. The suspected shooter left in a green car down Sutter Street. The victim was taken to a nearby hospital.
East Martin Luther King Boulevard
A man was shot and killed in what appears to be an attempted robbery, police said. Two men demanded money from a man along East Martin Luther King Boulevard and South Stanislaus Street in the Seaport District shortly before 6 p.m.
Investigators say the man was shot while he was reaching into his pocket.
East Sonora Street
A man walking down Sonora Street was approached by a car full of people around 9:30 p.m. Thursday. A passenger got out of the car and shot the man at least once before the car sped off.
