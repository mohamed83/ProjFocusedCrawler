	The church is usually a retreat for solace, prayer, and reflection, but on Wednesday night, in Charleston, S.C., a cold-hearted killer made it a place to unleash his fury.



	The FBI is searching for a white man in his 20s, who sat through an hour of service at the Mother Emanuel AME Church, before 
killing six women and three men
, leaving behind a lone witness to spread his evil message.
