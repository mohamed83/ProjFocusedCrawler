JENNINGS, Mo. (PIX11)
 — Police in St. Louis are investigating the shooting death of a 23-year-old man who was shot while allegedly charging at an officer with a knife Friday night, 
KTVI reported
.


The incident occurred in a residential neighborhood in Jennings, where police responded to a 911 call of a man who barricaded himself in a house with access to knives and a Samurai sword. Thaddeus McCarroll’s worried mother was locked out and wanted her son to be removed from the home, calling his behavior “not normal.”


The first officers on the scene were unsuccessful in their attempts to coax McCarroll out of the house around 10:30 p.m. It took hours of negotiations for him to emerge from the home with a Bible in one hand and a knife in the other.


SWAT team members gave verbal commands for McCarroll to drop the knife, but he continued to approach police instead. They then fired a rubber bullet, which struck him in the leg, but McCarroll continued to close in on two officers with the knife still in his hand.


The officers then shot him several times.


A medic tried to revive McCarroll, but he died at the scene.




The St. Louis Police Department released video from the scene, taken from body cameras worn by officers involved in the incident.


In July 2014, police responded to a 911 call involving McCarroll in a state of mental distress. He was able to be subdued and taken in for professional treatment in that incident.
