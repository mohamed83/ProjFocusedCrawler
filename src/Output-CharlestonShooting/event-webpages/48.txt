Summary




Here’s an updated summary of what we know so far:




Six women and three men were killed 
when a white suspect 
opened fired 
in the historic black church of Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina.


Police are still hunting for a suspect
, 
described
 as a “highly dangerous” white male, aged between 21 and 25. They have released CCTV images of the suspect and his car. The suspect was 
in the church for about hour 
before opening fire


The shooting is being 
investigated as a 
hate crime
. “
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it is hate crime,” Police Chief Greg Mullen told a news conference without elaborating.


The DoJ has launched a 
federal civil rights investigation
 into the shooting, according to 
media reports


One of those killed 
has been named 
as 
Clementa Pinckney
, Emanuel church’s pastor and a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate. He had campaigned for police to wear body cameras. The police said they did not know if anyone was specifically targeted in the killing


Eight people were dead when police arrived
 on the scene, following an emergency call on Wednesday evening just after 9pm local time. A ninth person died later in hospital.


Three people survived the attack, 
police said. There are unconfirmed reports that the suspect allowed one of the survivors to leave the church so she could report what happened. The police are continuing to interview survivors.


Questions are being asked
 about 
racial tensions in the state
, where 
Walter Scott
, a black man, 
was shot dead by a police officer
 in April, and the 
confederate flag still flies
 in the grounds of the state building. The NAACP said it was outraged at what it described as a senseless and cowardly killing

“America does not have a monopoly on racism. But what makes its racism so lethal is the ease with which people can acquire guns,” writes Guardian columnist Gary Younge on Comment is free.






While the new conversation around race will mean the political response to the fact of this attack will be different, the 
stale conversation around gun control
 means the legislative response to the nature of this attack will remain the same. Nothing will happen.


After Adam Lanza 
shot 20 primary school children and six adults in Sandy Hook
, Connecticut, in 2012 before turning his gun on himself, nothing happened. 
Seven children and teens are shot dead every day
 in America and nothing happens.


So these nine victims will join those who perished before them – a sacrifice to the blood-soaked pedestal erected around the constitution’s second amendment that gun lobbyists say guarantees the right of individuals to bear arms. Where guns are concerned this is what passes for 
American exceptionalism
 – an 18th century compromise with fatal 21st century ramifications. For the parishioners of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston nothing will ever be the same again. And for those who have the power to prevent it happening again, nothing will change.

Rev John Paul Brown, who will be leading prayers for the victims in Charleston, has urged the community against any retaliation for the attack. Speaking to WBTV he said: “At this point there is so much healing that is needed.” He said if the community chose to fight violence with violence it would lose. “As a faith community we would kill everything that we stand for [if we resorted to violence].” 


He then added this cryptic appeal” “Somebody knows something and we are depending that those people who know something think about the humanity about what should be done. And I believe it’s going to be a quick resolve.”

Summary




Here’s an updated summary of what we know so far: 




Six women and three men were killed 
when a white suspect opened fired in the historic black church of Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina. 


Police are still hunting for a suspect
, 
described
 as a “highly dangerous” white male, aged between 21 and 25. They have released CCTV images of the suspect and his car. 


The shooting is being 
investigated as a 
hate crime
. “
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it is hate crime,” Police Chief Greg Mullen told a news conference without elaborating. 


The suspect was 
in the church for about hour 
before opening fire. 


One of those killed 
has been named
 as 
Clementa Pinckney
, Emanuel church’s pastor and a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate. He had campaigned for police to wear body cameras. The police said they did not know if anyone was targeted in the killing. 


Eight people were dead when police arrived
 on the scene, following an emergency call on Wednesday evening just after 9pm local time. A ninth person died later in hospital.


Three people survived the attack, 
police said. There are unconfirmed reports that the suspect allowed one of the survivors to leave the church so she could report what happened. The police are continuing to interview survivors. 


Republican presidential hopeful 
Jeb Bush
 has 
cancelled
 a planned campaign event in South Carolina on Thursday. 
Hillary Clinton
, who campaigned in Charleston earlier on Wednesday and is 
believed to have met
 Pinckney, 
said
 the news was “heartbreaking”.


South Carolina governor 
Nikki Haley
 
said
: We’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another.


Questions are being asked
 about 
racial tensions in the state
, where 
Walter Scott
, a black man, 
was shot dead by a police officer
 in April, and the 
confederate flag still flies
 in the grounds of the state building. The NAACP said it was outraged at what it described as a senseless and cowardly killing. 


The 
Emanuel AME church
 has a 
rich history
, including a 
visit
 from 
Martin Luther King
.

NAACP expresses outrage




The NAACP 
has expressed its outrage
 at what it says were senseless and cowardly killings. 


Its president Cornell Brooks put out this statement: 






The NAACP was founded to fight against racial hatred and we are outraged that 106 years later, we are faced today with another mass hate crime. Our heartfelt prayers and soul-deep condolences go out to the families and community of the victims at Charleston’s historic Emanuel AME Church. The senselessly slain parishioners were in a church for Wednesday night bible study. There is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people engaged in the study of scripture. Today I mourn as an AME minister, as a student and teacher of scripture, as well as a member of the NAACP. 


The NAACP 
South Carolina
 State Conference and Charleston Branch have been working on the ground—with police and the community to bring this case to a close. We remain vigilant while the local police and FBI investigate this hate crime and bring the shooter to justice.

The suspect briefly observed a Bible group meeting before standing up and opening fire, according to Dr Norvel Goff, a senior pastor at the AME church in Columbia. He gave this statement after meeting families and the mayor, according to Robert Costa from the Washington Post.

In April, Rev Pinckney, the pastor who was killed in the shooting, led a “Requiem on Racism” in the church.


He said he hoped the service would help “root out any forms of violence and bigotry”.

Summary








Claire Phipps




Here is what we know so far, as police in South Carolina continue to hunt for a gunman who shot dead nine people in their church in Charleston:




Nine people have died
 after a gunman entered the Emanuel AME church in Charleston.


Police are still hunting a suspect
, 
described
 as a white male, aged about 21.


The shooting is being 
investigated as a 
hate crime
.


One of those killed 
has been named
 as 
Clementa Pinckney
, Emanuel church’s pastor and a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate.


Eight people were dead when police arrived
 on the scene, following an emergency call on Wednesday evening just after 9pm local time.


A ninth person died later 
in hospital.


At least one other person was taken to hospital
. Police would not confirm the number of survivors or their condition.


Police and the mayor are 
due to hold
 a further 
press conference at 7am
 local time (noon BST/9pm AEST).

Republican presidential hopeful 
Jeb Bush
 has 
cancelled
 a planned campaign event in South Carolina on Thursday. 
Hillary Clinton
, who campaigned in Charleston earlier on Wednesday and is 
believed to have met
 Pinckney, 
said
 the news was “heartbreaking”.


South Carolina governor 
Nikki Haley
 
said
:








 We’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another.








 But 
questions are being asked
 about 
racial tensions in the state
, where 
Walter Scott
, a black South Carolina man 
was shot dead by a police officer
 in April, and the 
confederate flag still flies
 in the grounds of the state building.


Pinckney 
helped lead a prayer vigil
 for Scott, and campaigned for legislation to require police officers to wear body cameras. The requirement 
became law
 one week ago.


The 
Emanuel AME church
 has a 
rich history
, including a 
visit
 from 
Martin Luther King
.


A man handcuffed
 by police officers earlier on Wednesday evening, fitting the description of the suspect, 
has been released
 and is not considered a suspect.


The suspect is described as a white male, aged about 21, slender and clean-shaven. He was said to be wearing a grey sweatshirt, blue jeans and Timberland boots.




I’m handing over this blog to my colleague 
Matthew Weaver
 now. We will continue to bring you the latest updates as the story unfolds.

My colleague 
Matthew Weaver
 has put together this profile of 
Clementa Pinckney
, the pastor shot dead in his church with eight others:




In April Pinckney 
helped lead a prayer vigil 
for 
Walter Scott
, a black South Carolina man 
who was shot dead by a police officer
 as he tried to run away.


Pinckney campaigned for legislation to require police officers to wear body cameras while working. He said: “Body cameras help to record what happens. It may not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but it helps to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop.”


The Rev 
Joseph Darby
, the presiding elder at Beaufort AME Church, described Pinckney as “an advocate for the people”. He told MSNBC: “He was a very caring and competent pastor, and he was a very brave man. Brave men sometimes die difficult deaths.”




Pinckney leaves a wife, Jennifer, and two children, Eliana and Malana.

Clementa Pinckney named among the dead




Multiple reports have said that Rev 
Clementa Pinckney
, Emanuel church’s pastor and a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate, was among the nine people killed.


This has yet to be officially confirmed by Charleston police or the coroner, but South Carolina state house minority leader 
Todd Rutherford 
has told the Associated Press that Pinckney was among those killed:






He never had anything bad to say about anybody, even when I thought he should.


He was always out doing work either for his parishioners or his constituents. He touched everybody. 






Pinckney, 41, was a married father of two who was elected to the state house at age 23, making him the youngest member at the time. He was elected to the South Carolina Senate in 2000.

It’s not yet clear whether we will hear at that point, or before, the identities of those killed. So far, despite many reports on social media, no names have been confirmed.


Authorities have also so far declined to say how many people survived – though we know at least one person is in hospital – and what is their condition.

Following the shooting, a group of pastors huddled together praying in a circle across the street.


Community organiser 
Christopher Cason 
told reporters he felt certain the shootings were racially motivated. 






I am very tired of people telling me that I don’t have the right to be angry.


I am very angry right now.






Even before the 
killing of local black man Walter Scott
 by a white police officer in April, Cason said he had been part of a group meeting with police and local leaders to try to shore up better relationships.

Charleston’s police chief has said the shooting is being investigated as a hate crime.


South Carolina has faced claims of systemic racism, reports my colleague 
Tom Dart
:

The shooting happened in the heart of downtown Charleston, a wealthy area which is one of the most historic and popular tourist destinations in the US and only a couple of blocks from the College of Charleston, which has about 12,000 students.


Racial tensions were raised by the death of 
Walter Scott
, a 
black man shot in the back by a white police officer
 in April in North Charleston, an adjacent city of about 100,000 people where nearly half the population is black. 
Protestors said
 the killing was evidence of systemic racism in the state. 


The Confederate flag, which many African-Americans see as a symbol of racial hatred, flew on top of the state capitol building in Columbia until 2000 and is still on display in the grounds on a pole in front of the capitol.






The black population of central Charleston has sharply declined amid rising house prices and gentrification, reversing the “white flight” that happened after desegregation of schools in the 1960s, according to a 
Post and Courier article from last year
.

The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church has a rich history, Associated Press reports:




The Emmanuel AME church is a historic African-American church that traces its roots to 1816, when several churches split from Charleston’s Methodist Episcopal church.


One of its founders, 
Denmark Vesey
, tried to organize a slave revolt in 1822. He was caught, and white landowners had his church burned in revenge. Parishioners worshipped underground until after the Civil War.




The church’s own website
 says it is the oldest AME church in the south, with “one of the largest and oldest black congregations south of Baltimore”:




The wooden two-story church that was built on the present site in 1872 was destroyed by the devastating earthquake of August 31, 1886.


The present edifice was completed in 1891.

Here are some more of the comments from the police press conference, at which it was confirmed that nine people were shot dead in the attack on the Emanuel AME church.


Police chief 
Greg Mullen
 said:






At 9.05 we received a call on a shooting that occurred here in Charleston. When officers arrived they found a number of victims inside and we had individuals transported to the trauma centre.


There were eight deceased inside the church.






Another person died later in hospital, Mullen said:






At this point we have nine victims in this heinous crime that has been committed.








I believe this was a hate crime. It will be investigated as a hate crime.




Mayor
 Joseph P Riley Jr
 called the shooting an “unspeakable tragedy”:






The most dastardly act that one can possibly imagine.


The message is this is one hateful person that did these dastardly deeds.

My colleague 
Michael Safi
 files this report on the latest developments:




At least nine people have been killed after a gunman opened fire at a historic black church in Charleston, 
South Carolina
, in what police have described as a hate crime.


A bomb threat was also briefly issued after security services swarmed the area around the Emanuel AME Church, whose pastor 
Clementa Pinckney
, a Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate, was said to be present at the time of the shooting.


Police have not confirmed the identities of the victims, eight of whom were killed in the church, another dying later in hospital.


Charleston police chief 
Greg Mullen
 said there were survivors, but declined to give more details.


The suspect, who is still on the loose, has been described as a clean-shaved, white male aged approximately 21, with a small, slender build, wearing a grey sweatshirt with jeans and boots.


Mullen said he believed the shooting was “a hate crime”.


The city’s mayor, 
Joseph P Riley Jr
, described the killing as an “unspeakable tragedy”, pledging to catch “this awful person and bring him to justice as soon as possible”.


He said he had met with relatives of the victims in a “heartbreaking scene”.


South Carolina governor 
Nikki Haley
 said details of the shooting were still unclear, but “we do know that we’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another”.


“Please join us in lifting up the victims and their families with our love and prayers,” she said.


Presidential candidate 
Jeb Bush
 has cancelled a planned trip to the state, and the South Carolina legislature has suspended a sitting planned for Thursday.

South Carolina is no stranger to mass shootings. Six people died in Greenwood, 180 miles from Charleston, in 2013 when 
Bryan Sweatt killed three adults, two children and himself
 using a handgun as the result of a domestic dispute.


In 2011, Susan Hendricks shot dead her two sons, her ex-husband and her stepmother in the small town of Liberty.


After being fired from his job at a lawnmower equipment factory in Aiken County in 1997, Hastings Wise returned weeks later and killed four employees with a semiautomatic gun, injuring three others. He was executed in 2005.

Austin Rich
, the local photographer who was 
handcuffed by officers
 earlier as he resembled 
the suspect’s description
, has been released, in a case of mistaken identity.


He said the police were “just doing their job”.

A reminder of the description issued by Charleston police earlier tonight.


The suspect is still at large.


He is described as a white male, aged around 21, slender and clean-shaven.


He was said to be wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and Timberland boots.

 – has shown these images of the interior of the church, taken before today’s shooting.


It’s a historic church, and the current building dates to 1891.

There are reports locally that
 Clementa Pinckney
, the church pastor and Democratic member of the South Carolina Senate, was at the church at the time of the shooting.


We have no further information on his condition, or that of any of the church members who were present when the gunman attacked.


I will bring you that information once it is confirmed.

The 
Emanuel church website
 says:




Rev. Pinckney was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1996 at the age of twenty-three. In 2000, he was elected to the State Senate at the age of twenty-seven.


He is one of the youngest persons and the youngest African-American in South Carolina to be elected to the State Legislature. He represents Jasper, Beaufort, Charleston, Colleton, and Hampton Counties …


He and his wife Jennifer have two children – Eliana and Malana.

Reporters on the scene say they are being asked to move away from Calhoun Street, the site of the shooting, with some suggestion of a possible bomb threat.


This, like so many details so far, has not been confirmed and it would not be unusual for police to clear the area after such an incident, and with a suspect on the loose.


Barriers have been erected now to keep people away from the scene of the shooting:

I understand there will be a police briefing fairly soon, at which we might expect to hear some details of any fatalities or injuries.


So far, despite media reports of multiple deaths inside the church, nothing has been confirmed by authorities.

There were earlier reports that a man fitting the description of the suspect had been arrested – this turned out to be a false alarm, says my colleague

: 




Police briefly detained a man who appeared to match the description of the shooter, a slender white male with a gray sweatshirt, sparking rumours on social media that the manhunt was over. 


He was tentatively identified as a local photographer, and the search continued.

My colleague 
Erin McCann
 has some background on the church targeted in tonight’s attack:




The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is the oldest such house of worship in the American south. It is one of the oldest and largest black congregations south of Baltimore, 
according to its website
. 


Its congregation is led by the Reverend 
Clementa Pinckney
, a Democratic representative in the state senate.


The church was burned in the 1820s during an investigation into a slave rebellion, according to a church history.


Its worship services went underground from 1834, when black worship was outlawed, until 1865, when the American civil war ended. It has 
stood at its present site
 since 1872.

There is very little official information so far, as police concentrate their efforts on tracking down the suspect.


It has been reported that a bible study group was meeting in the church at the time of the shooting.


I should stress that at this point we cannot confirm media reports that a number of people have been killed.

What we know so far








Claire Phipps




A gunman has opened fire at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and was still at large, a police official has said. 


Charleston Police Department spokesman Charles Francis told Reuters the shooting occurred at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church around 9pm local time.


He said police were still searching for a suspect.


The suspect was described as a white male, slender, aged around 21, wearing a grey sweatshirt, jeans and boots. He was clean-shaven.

There have been media reports of possible fatalities in the attack, but this has not been confirmed.


The website for the church said it has one of the largest and oldest black congregations in the region.


We will have updates on this live blog as the situation unfolds.
