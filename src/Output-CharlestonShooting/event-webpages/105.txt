Police shoot, kill NC man who allegedly charged at them with knife






 
Alan Joseph Rushton






WAKE FOREST, N.C. – A North Carolina man was shot and killed after charging at officers with a knife, according to authorities.


WRAL 
reported
 that Wake Forest police responded to a domestic disturbance call at a home on Friday.


The caller said her husband, 38-year-old Alan Joseph Rushton, cornered her in the closet and slammed her face into the door frame.


Authorities reportedly tried to talk to Rushton, but he allegedly barricaded himself in an upstairs bedroom. Officials tried for hours to get him to surrender.


The suspect is accused of charging at officers with a knife after officials tried to safely take him into custody.


Police fired shots at Rushton and hit the suspect who was taken to the hospital and died.


The officer who fired was Dustin d’Hemecourt, a member of the Wake Forest police since February 2014.


The State Bureau of Investigation has been called in to investigate. The officer has been placed on administrative leave with pay.


It’s reportedly the second time in two months that police have responded to a call at the Rushton home.
