                    After Charleston shooting, Hanaway cancels fundraiser with South Carolina governor                 

        by Eli Yokley • June 18, 2015 


— For more than a month, Republican gubernatorial candidate Catherine Hanaway had been inviting donors to a fundraiser Thursday night at Hunter Farms with an all-star host committee matched by a well known headliner, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. 
But, that all changed on Thursday morning as the nation woke up to the story of a shocking church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. 
Hanaway, in an email to donors who had planned to attend, called for prayers for South Carolina. 
“With the wounds of this tragedy still so fresh, we are of course postponing our event scheduled for this evening with Governor Haley,” she said. “The people of South Carolina need their governor.”
Thursday’s fundraiser was set to be one of Hanaway’s largest so far, as the former House Speaker and federal prosecutor readies for the pending entrance of more Republican candidates into the field this summer. 
Read the email below:
“By this time, I am sure that you are all aware of the atrocity committed in Charleston, South Carolina last night, where according to press reports a man murdered nine worshippers at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.  I hope that you will all join me in prayer for the victims and their families, as well as for swift justice to be meted out against the perpetrator.  Racism has no place in our society, and violence of this nature is simply intolerable.
In its storied 200-year history, the pulpit at Emanuel AME has hosted the likes of Booker T. Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the church has been a bastion of resilience for its parishioners and community through troubled times and tragedy.  With God’s help, I pray that the community will be able to triumph over adversity once again.  As it is written in the Book of Lamentations, “Though He brings grief, He will show compassion, so great is His unfailing love.”
With the wounds of this tragedy still so fresh, we are of course postponing our event scheduled for this evening with Governor Haley.  The people of South Carolina need their governor, and I firmly believe that South Carolina could have no stronger and more capable leader than Nikki to steer the ship of state through this crisis.
As always, thank you for your continued support, and I hope that you will be able to join me in welcoming Governor Haley to our great state as soon as she is able to make the trip.”
