HOLMDEL, N.J. — There’s a manhunt underway Tuesday for a lone shooter who hurt two people after a J.Cole concert at the PNC Bank Arts Center, according to police.


New Jersey State Police said the shooting happened about 11:16 p.m. Monday. They’re searching for the gunman in wooded area surrounding the concert venue.


Both victims, who have not been identified, were taken to a hospital in critical condition.


Mike Lefanto, of Forked River,  N.J., posted two pictures of the apparent victims in the shooting on Twitter and gave his witness account to PIX11 News.

According to Lefanto, he was with his 13-year-old daughter walking to their car when they heard a man comment on a woman’s appearance in front of them.


“There were these two guys, whatever they said to this woman was enough to make her react,” Lefanto said. “Then heard a few pops. I was like, ‘Oh, fireworks because it’s the summertime,’ until I turned around and saw a guy with a gun. That’s when we started running.”


Lefanto said the shooting happened a point-blank range. He said he heard about seven shots being fired from what appeared to be a small-caliber weapon.


Police and paramedics responded within seconds, he said, since they were staged nearby.


Hip-hop artists Big Sean, YG and Jeremih performed at a sold out concert Monday night for J.Cole’s Forest Hills Drive tour. The shooting happened after the concert finished.
