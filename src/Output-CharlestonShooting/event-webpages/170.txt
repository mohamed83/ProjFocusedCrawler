Cop Shoots Suspect In South Shore

Dozens gather at Bethel A.M.E. in Greensboro to remember victims of Charleston shooting

GREENSBORO, N.C. — Dozens of people filled Bethel A.M.E. Church including people with close ties to the historic Charleston church, for a community vigil to remember the victims of the shooting.   
“We would walk to the church,” said Mozell Weston who grew up in Emanuel A.M.E and returned last summer for a family reunion.  “Going back home it reminds me of my foundation, where I sang in the choir, seeing my Sunday school teacher.”
Weston knows the family of the victims and said the pain of Wednesday night is being comforted by the community. 
 “Joy to know that you are not in this by yourself,” she said.  “It’s going to be a period time of healing for all of us and this is just the beginning of the journey.”
Weston said she is searching for understanding; not just for the families who lost loved ones but also for the alleged shooter Dylann Roof, that maybe some sense will be made of the events so it won’t happen again.

(CBS) —
 A Chicago police officer shot a man multiple times early this morning after, police say, he pointed a gun at the officer, reports WBBM’s Mike Krauser. 


According to police, officers responded to a call of men with guns at 71st and Merrill in the South Shore neighborhood just after midnight. 


Police say that four men were standing on the corner and one of them started running. Deputy Chief Berscott Ruiz says the man was holding a weapon which he was told to drop.

“Individual turned, raised the gun towards the officer and the officer fired his weapon several times, striking the individual multiple times,” Ruiz said. 


A witness said she thought the 23-year-old man was hit six times. She said the man was handcuffed after he was shot and claimed an officer kicked him while he was on the ground. The witness said the man has a baby on the way. 


The man’s condition is not known.  Police recovered a gun at the scene.
