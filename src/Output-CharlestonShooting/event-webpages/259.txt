NJ.com reports
 that the mother and family of Jerame Reid, along with a community activist, gathered at a home in Bridgeton, New Jersey on Saturday, saying they will seek a federal civil rights investigation. 


The move comes days after a grand jury voted to not file charges against two Bridgeton police officers 
who shot and killed the 36-year-old Reid
 following a traffic stop. 


“I feel that justice was not served,” said Shelia Reid, the victim’s mother. “We want justice and peace. I want a thorough investigation.” 


Jerame Reid was the passenger in a car that was pulled over on 30 December, after it ran a stop sign. Bridgeton police officers Braheme Days and Roger Worley repeatedly ordered Reid to stay inside the vehicle after Days recovered what appeared to be a gun from the vehicle’s glovebox, according to dashcam video. 


Reid ignored the orders and exited the vehicle with his hands up. Both officers shot at Reid but only Days struck him, killing him. 


Community activist Walter Hudson said he would seek a federal civil rights investigation, according to the newspaper, and intended to contact New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor.
