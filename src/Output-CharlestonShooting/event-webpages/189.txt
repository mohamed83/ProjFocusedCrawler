Police-Involved Shooting








The FBI posted this surveillance image online of a bank robbery suspect who was fatally shot by Evanston police upon leaving the Chase Bank at 901 Grove St. (FBI)


(CBS) —
 A bank-robbery suspect has been fatally shot by police in downtown Evanston.


The suspect robbed a Chase Bank branch in the 900 block of Grove Street around 3 p.m. Monday afternoon, Evanston police said in a news release.


Responding officers attempted to stop the armed offender, based on a description from a bank teller, near Maple Avenue and Davis Street. When he refused to drop his weapon, officers opened fire, hitting the suspect, police said.


The suspect was taken to Evanston Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police recovered money and a weapon at the shooting scene, the release said.


Information posted by the FBI online indicates the suspect who robbed the Evanston bank struck another bank last Thursday — a TCF Bank branch at 4355 N. Sheridan in Chicago.
