									BREAKING REPORTS: Mass Shooting In N. Charleston South Carolina…							


Centinel2012:Lets hope this is not the start of more violence started by the agenda driven administration.
Originally posted on The Last Refuge:
Sketchy details, but possibly 8 people deceased.  In Charleston SC there is a MASSIVE response, including confirmation of FBI, to a mass casualty shooting event being described as taking place in a church.    Initial ground reports are the LEO response units are severely distressed at what has been found so far.

Twitter users complained that Dylann Roof, 21, wasn't described as a terrorist, even though he is suspected of a possible hate crime in which he allegedly killed nine people at a church.
 
 
 
 

	Where are the white leaders?



	Outraged Twitter users jumped online to denounce the hypocrisy of the coverage and slant of the Charleston church shooting, allegedly perpetrated by a 
white hatemonger who massacred black worshippers
 at a 
historic African-American sanctuary.
 
 
 
What the media won't say tomorrow re: 
#Charleston
:
1) This was domestic terrorism
2) Gun violence is out of control
3) Black lives matter

FULL COVERAGE OF CHARLESTON CHURCH MASSACRE
 
 
 
In which white community was he radicalised?

Are there more white terror cells?

When will moderate white leaders act?

	“Where are white leaders? Why is there no leadership in the white community?” wrote black Twitter user Justin McBride, who hashtagged his message #CharlestonShooting. “Figured I’d ask, since they always ask us.”

A Charleston police officer searches for a shooting suspect outside the Emanuel AME Church, in downtown Charleston, S.C., on Wednesday.
 
 
 



	The mass shooting by a white perpetrator comes after a rash of recent high-profile police killings involving black people. In those instances, Twitter users wrote, media commentators demanded a response from black leaders like the Rev. Al Sharpton to make sense of the tragedy. And if the incident involved rioting or rule breaking by black suspects, commentators looked at broken households or rap music as potential “causes.”

DYLANN ROOF WORE WHITE SUPREMACIST FLAG PATCHES ON HIS JACKET

	“Where are the white fathers? (nvm...they are buying guns for their sons to murder our families, pastors, leaders,” wrote Twitter user “Stacia.”
 
 
 
He is a terrorist/murderer of 9 Black people. But because he's white the media won't shame him as they do Blackness.

	Others pointed at cable TV news channels like Fox News, which on Thursday morning described the massacre as a “war on faith” and religion — not on race, despite officials calling the bloodbath a hate crime.

	South Carolina, several people pointed out, still 
flies the Confederate flag above its state house 
in Columbia, where suspect Dylann Roof was from.
 
 
 
Are whites inherently violent? Where are the white leaders? If they dont like the people here why dont they go back to where they came from?

	“The headline on the breaking news report about the Charleston shooting was an additional example of how the White Racial Frame dominates news coverage,” wrote Chauncey Devega, 
who contributes to Salon
 and runs a blog, “We Are Respectable Negroes.” “MSNBC’s screen read ‘Police searching for 21-year-old suspect.’ He was not described as ‘white’: the American news media is much more likely to racially mark black and brown suspects in crimes, and to include their racial description (or religious/ethnic as in the ubiquitous ‘Arab’ or ‘Muslim’ ‘terrorist.’”)

DYLANN ROOF BRAGGED ABOUT PLANS 'TO KILL A BUNCH OF PEOPLE'
 
 
 
Let it sink in. White dude walks into black church & murdered 9 people during bible study last night. Real thuggish.

	Devega continued: “Once and again, white privilege is the power to be the ultimate individual where one’s actions and behavior rarely if ever reflects on the collective character of white people en masse. By comparison, Black and brown Americans, Muslims, Arabs and the Other more generally are routinely subjected to group punishment and demonization.”
 
 
 
The black community steadily has to get up & talk to people about violence in their communities. White leaders--your turn. Face it. Fix it.

	The National Rifle Association, meanwhile, tweeted nothing about the tragedy, instead sending out links to the NRA National Firearms Museum and Shooting Illustrated magazine.

	Graham, 
in an interview with CNN
, said he didn’t think race was relevant to the murder.
 
 
 
 
 
 




EMANUEL AME CHURCH HAS LONG HISTORY, TIES TO SLAVE REBELLION



	"I just think he was one of these whacked out kids. I don't think it's anything broader than that," Graham told CNN. "It's about a young man who is obviously twisted."



	"No one at home [in South Carolina] believes this represents us. We don't want to be judged by him," Graham said.



	In a statement late Wednesday, Gov. Nikki Haley wrote that her family was “praying for the victims and families touched by tonight’s senseless tragedy.”




EDITORIAL: DYLANN ROOF IS A HOMEGROWN AMERICAN TERRORIST



	“While we do not yet know all of the details, we do know that we'll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another,” the Republican South Carolina governor said.



	Tim Scott, a black South Carolina senator, said his “heart is breaking for Charleston and South Carolina tonight.”



	“While we unfortunately know that hate enters some people’s hearts, I also know this: We can and will work every single day to replace hate with love, pain with kindness, and hospitality with good will,” the freshman Republican senator said in a statement.
