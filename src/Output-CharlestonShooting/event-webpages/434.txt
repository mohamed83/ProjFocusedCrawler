Police identify suspect in officer-involved shooting at NC McDonald’s


 


DURHAM, N.C. — Police have identified a suspect in the officer-involved shooting that happened at a Durham McDonald’s Wednesday morning.
The suspect, 26-year-old Dennis Lawrence Palm Jr., repeatedly threatened to kill an employee, according to a preliminary investigation. It is unclear if Palm was armed, but Durham Police Chief Jose Lopez said in a news conference Wednesday morning that Palm was capable of hurting the woman.
Authorities said after a brief standoff, an officer fired one shot, striking the suspect in the face. Palm, who was conscious and talking, was taken to the hospital for treatment of serious injuries.
