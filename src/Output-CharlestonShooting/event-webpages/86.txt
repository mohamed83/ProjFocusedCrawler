STATEMENT BY REV. AL SHARPTON ON THE KILLING OF NINE PEOPLE AT EMANUEL AME CHURCH IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA




FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

STATEMENT BY REV. AL SHARPTON ON THE KILLING OF NINE PEOPLE AT EMANUEL AME CHURCH IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA


 


NEW YORK – Rev. Al Sharpton, President of National Action Network (NAN), released the following statement on the shooting death of nine people at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina: 


 


“I am shocked and outraged about the killing of nine innocent people at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. What has our society come to when people in a prayer meeting in the sacred halls of a church can be shot in what is deemed 
a
 possible hate crime?


 


“The Pastor of the church, Reverend Clementa Pinckney, worked closely with our National Action Network Chapter leader and our Vice President of Religious Affairs, Rev. Nelson Rivers. It is chilling to me that just over two months ago while I was in North Charleston over the police shooting of Walter Scott, I’m reminded that Rev. Pinckney was among the clergy who stood with me at that occasion and now he has fallen victim to senseless violence.


 


“We must do what we can to apprehend the killer and we must support the families involved in this tragedy. Demagoguery, increasing tension, and talk of violence will only make a mockery of what we face.”
