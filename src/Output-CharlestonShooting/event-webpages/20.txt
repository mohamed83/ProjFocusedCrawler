CHARLESTON, S.C. — Dylann Roof, 21, of Lexington, South Carolina, is the suspect in Wednesday’s deadly shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the Charleston police said Thursday. He may be driving a black Hyundai with vehicle tag LGF330, police said.
He’s white, slightly built and in his early 20s — and police say he walked into a Charleston, South Carolina, church and fatally shot nine people as they attended Bible study class.
Dylann Storm Roof, 21, is now at the center of a major manhunt.
Police released a flier Thursday morning with details of the suspect in the attack on the historic African-American church as they appealed for help to track him down as quickly as possible.
“The following subject is wanted for the shooting that occured in Charleston at the Emanuel AME Church. Subject is Dylann Storm Roof w/m 4/3/1994 5’9″ 120 lbs. The subject should be driving a 2000 Hyundai Elantra GS, SC registration LGF330. The vehicle is dark-colored. Subject should be considered armed and dangerous and caution should be used if seen. “
Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen told a news conference that officers “have obtained surveillance videos of the suspect in this case and a suspect vehicle.”
Mullen said the suspect was a “younger white male between 21 and 25 years of age, 5-foot-9 in height” and “has a very distinctive sweatshirt that has markings.”
Mullen emphasized the suspect is “a very dangerous individual” and said “he should not be approached by anyone.”
Any people who recognize the suspect or spots the vehicle should alert law enforcement, he said, rather than trying to follow themselves.
Woman spared by shooter to give account?
A female survivor told family members that the gunman told her he was letting her live to tell everyone else what happened, Dot Scott, president of the local branch of the NAACP, told CNN.
Scott said she had not spoken to the survivor directly but had heard this account repeated at least a dozen times as she met with relatives of the victims Wednesday night. Scott added that she didn’t know if the survivor had ended up at the hospital or being questioned by police.
Because of the church’s historic significance, it is not unusual for visitors, whether white or black, to visit it, Scott said. She said she’d had no indication that any children were among the victims.
Mullen told the news conference the suspect had been in the church attending a meeting that was going on — and “stayed there almost an hour with the group before the actual event.”
But he declined to comment on whether the suspect had let one woman escape.
‘Distinctive’ license plate
The suspect was seen leaving the church in a black four-door sedan, the flier says. “The vehicle you will see has a very distinctive front license plate,” Mullen added.
He appealed for the media to help in circulating the suspect’s image and for the public to be vigilant. The clean-shaven man pictured wears a gray sweatshirt over a white T-shirt, blue jeans and Timberland boots.
“No one in this community will ever forget this night and as a result of this and because of the pain and the hurt this individual has caused this entire community, the law enforcement agents are committed and we will catch this individual,” Mullen said.
Charleston Mayor Joe Riley echoed that sentiment, saying everything must be done to find a culprit he described as “somebody filled with hate and with a deranged mind.”
The man is a “no-good, horrible person” who must be taken into custody as soon as possible, he said. “Of course we will make sure he pays the price for this horrible act.”
Wednesday night’s attack at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is being investigated as a hate crime. All the victims, who include the church’s pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, were black. Six of those killed were female and three male.

CHARLESTON, S.C. — 
Dylann Roof, 21, of Lexington, South Carolina, is the suspect in Wednesday’s deadly shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, the Charleston police said Thursday. He may be driving a black Hyundai with vehicle tag LGF330, police said.


Dylann Storm Roof, 21, is now at the center of a major manhunt.


Police released a flier Thursday morning with details of the suspect in the attack on the historic African-American church as they appealed for help to track him down as quickly as possible.


“The following subject is wanted for the shooting that occured in Charleston at the Emanuel AME Church. Subject is Dylann Storm Roof w/m 4/3/1994 5’9” 120 lbs. The subject should be driving a 2000 Hyundai Elantra GS, SC registration LGF330. The vehicle is dark-colored. Subject should be considered armed and dangerous and caution should be used if seen. “


Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen told a news conference that officers “have obtained surveillance videos of the suspect in this case and a suspect vehicle.”


According to The Post and Courier, Roof is currently out on bond in connection with multiple recent arrests on drug and trespassing charges. 
According to Lexington County School District One, Roof attended White Knoll High School in Lexington, South Carolina for one year, WCSC is reporting. 


Mullen said the suspect was a “younger white male between 21 and 25 years of age, 5-foot-9 in height” and “has a very distinctive sweatshirt that has markings.”


Mullen emphasized the suspect is “a very dangerous individual” and said “he should not be approached by anyone.”


The uncle of the suspect told Reuters he recognized his nephew in the photo released by police. He also said Roof received a .45 caliber pistol as a birthday present in April.


Witnesses told officials Roof reportedly said he was at the church to shoot black people, a source told CNN.


Any people who recognize the suspect or spots the vehicle should alert law enforcement, he said, rather than trying to follow themselves.

The shooting victims at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church “were killed because they were black,” Charleston police spokesman Charles Francis told CNN’s Nick Valencia on Thursday. Francis said this after Valencia asked them what is leading authorities to investigate the shooting as a hate crime.

odd that their gun laws are weak but there is no connection…  hmm


South Carolina law does not:


    Require a background check prior to the transfer of a firearm between unlicensed individuals;

    Regulate the transfer or possession of assault weapons, 50 caliber rifles or large capacity ammunition magazines;

    Require firearm owners to obtain a license, register their firearms, or report lost or stolen firearms;

    Require the reporting of mental health information to the federal database used for firearm purchaser background checks;

    Impose a waiting period prior to purchase of a firearm;

    Limit the number of firearms that may be purchased at one time;

    Significantly regulate ammunition sales;

    Allow local governments to regulate firearms or ammunition; or

    Give law enforcement discretion to deny a concealed handgun permit.


In 2010, South Carolina had the 15th highest number of gun deaths per capita among the states. In addition, based on data published by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, South Carolina supplied the sixth highest number of crime guns to other states per capita in 2009, and exports far more crime guns than it imports.

Yes, bury your head in the sand like every gun incident America has to do with. Of course it has NOTHING to do with the fact that anybody (yes, even the mentally fucked up) can easily get a gun (owing to lax gun laws, because MURICA right?)

Thanks for identifying those I was wondering what they were. So this @55h0le is some kind of White Supremacy moron? I think he should be put in a cell with Rachel Dolezal and let’s see what happens.

“He also said Roof received a .45 caliber pistol as a birthday present in April.”  


“Happy Birthday, kid! Here’s a murder machine.”

Many 16 year olds are given a “murder machine” (AKA a 2000+ pound motor vehicle) for their birthday, I don’t see your point.

Of course you see his point, you just don’t WANT to. Motor vehicles are made to get from point a to point b; they’re not designed to kill people. A gun is only designed for one thing and you know what that is.

A gun is designed for one thing…is it: Target practice? Self defense? Peace through strength? A hobby? I could go on…

I would suggest you think about mental health as the issue here, not guns. I would also urge that this child was never taught the importance of life, which we should also be pointing the finger at instead of guns. Just as spoons don’t make us fat, guns don’t kill. It’s the mental disease which causes someone to murder a life.


I would also add that gun control against the citizens of a country only does one thing…it takes guns from citizens and leaves them in the hands of the criminals and governments. I would urge you to look at history to see how that plays out every time.

Whether or not this was a false flag (which probably will never be proven just as 99% of the others couldn’t be), I can guarantee that those with an agenda will use this event to further their agenda rather than fixing the problem of this country.


Too many lies and political stunts…we need real solutions. We need to completely overhaul our government and political leaders. It’s time to fire them all and start fresh.

Why do they immediately say it’s a hate crime? The guy just might be a psycho that would’ve shot anybody he saw! If a black guy shoots 9 white people race is never even mentioned! This victim mentality is what fuels all of this BS!


When we elected President Obama, weren’t we promised “hope and change”?  It seems like his years as president have only torn our nation apart.  


We now have race riots in our streets.  I’ve never seen a country more divided. We all hate each other now.


They say a good economy cures all.  Many of our citizens have had their jobs taken away along with their health insurance.  The middle class is shrinking and its not getting any better.


Obama and Co have destroyed everything they’ve tried “to fix”.  My health insurance is $450/month, my taxes are closing in on 50% (in NYC), and even my subway pass is now over $100/month (in NYC). Stuff that is still private enterprise is super cheap. Car insurance ($25/month from Insurance Panda), cell phone ($22/month from T Mobile), and gym ($15/month from Planet Fitness).   


We have become a very angry country. Everyone is only out for themselves, no sense of community, no respectable dialogue on any issue, talking heads shouting down opposing views. Very sad.

Unfortunately there r sick, demented ppl. I see ppl blaming the president, the gun & other stuff, very likely parents r to blame but at 21 we all know right from wrong! Yes it was a hate crime, the freak said “I wanted to kill as many black ppl I could”! I do think we r throwing around “hate crime” a bit much but this is obvious! Also it has come out HE bought the gun w birthday money, didn’t get the gun for his bday. At this point the story will probably change a few times. So instead of idiots fighting & hating on each other let’s just agree he is a sicko who will get & deserves the death penalty after getting beat in prison!!!!
