'This is an absolutely troubling and heart-wrenching moment,' Mayor de Blasio said of Wednesday night's massacre at a South Carolina church.
 
 
 
 

	New York politicians, clergy and civil rights leaders expressed shock and outrage 
Thursday over the South Carolina church massacre.



	“This is an absolutely troubling and heart-wrenching moment,” Mayor de Blasio said.



	“The fact is that nine innocent lives are lost.”

	“Our prayers are with the families of those who are lost,” he added. “Our prayers are with the members of that church and all of the people of Charleston today.”

	The Rev. Al Sharpton called the mass killing “one of the most horrendous acts that I have ever seen.”

	“To walk into a church and kill nine people in a place that should be sacred is a new low in hate and atrocities in this country,” Sharpton said in a news conference at the National Action Network’s Harlem headquarters. “None of us are safe if we cannot go to a church for Bible study.”



	Sharpton said he had been close with one of the victims — State Sen. Clementa Pinckney.



	Pinckney, 41, was also the pastor of the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, where authorities say gunman Dylann Roof fatally shot nine people Wednesday night.

	“When I was there in April he joined our prayer vigil for Walter Scott who was killed by police,” Sharpton said.



	The Rev. Reginald Lee Bachus, associate pastor at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, said that the community was rocked by the news of the shooting.




SUSPECTED CHARLESTON CHURCH GUNMAN DYLANN STORM ROOF CAUGHT



	"This is a sad day — it used to be that the house of the Lord was our only sanctuary," he said. "I think it's horrific and we are absolutely enraged and just devastated that this would happen.



	"I believe this was an attack on Christianity, as well as an attack on African-Americans," Bachus added.
 
 
 
 
 
 



	The mass murder was on the minds of the parishioners and workers streaming inside the food pantry at the Allen A.M.E. Church in Jamaica, Queens.



	“That wasn't God, that was Satan,” said Pauline Griffin, 62, a pantry volunteer. “We're not safe in the church, not safe in our homes, not safe outside. We should be somewhere where you can have a safe haven.”

Police were seen securing Calhoun St. where a gunman opened fire on a prayer meeting killing nine people at historic Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.
 
 
 



	The NYPD has also reached out to black churches in the city to advise them to call police if they have any concerns or see something suspicious, the source said.



	“The NYPD’s prayers are with the victims and the survivors of last night’s terrible shooting in Charleston,” Police Commissioner Bill Bratton tweeted Thursday.



	It doesn’t appear that the shooting had any connection to terror groups, a high-ranking police source said.

This is a tragedy! I’ve never understood the motivation behind all these wackos that feel the need to get some notoriety by killing others. I can’t help wondering how being detained and questioned will affect the life of that photographer who just happened to be wearing the wrong outfit!  It shouldn’t, but you know that tons of people will see him in handcuffs but not read far enough to see that he was released!  Here’s an interesting article about the pastor that was killed…

Maybe this has been discussed already. I haven’t caught up with the story here yet or all the comments on all threads. Just curious: Any crime scene photos yet? What about the report that 30 of the shooter’s 80-something friends on Facebook are black? Isn’t that curious for a racist?

And “his” name has been spelled three different ways that I’ve seen so far: Dylan, Dyllan, and this (most interesting) Dylann.  ANN?  He does look very effeminate. The small ankle in the large boots, and then the alleged comment about women being raped …
