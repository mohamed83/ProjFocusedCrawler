Ten days that turned America into a better place

<<<<<<< HEAD
CHICAGO (STMW)
 – A suspect was wounded during a police-involved shooting early Saturday in the South Side Chatham neighborhood.


The police-involved shooting occurred at 11 p.m. in the 9300 block of South Vernon Avenue, said Police News Affairs Officer Amina Greer, citing preliminary information.


No officers were injured but a suspect was wounded, Greer said.


Scott Ando, a spokesperson for the police Independent Review Authority, which investigates all police-involved shootings, confirmed the shooting.


Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden said police were responding to a domestic disturbance call and found a man with a gun in the backyard. Police identified themselves and told the man to drop the gun. The man raised the gun and officers fired at him. He was struck several times and suffered non-life threatening injuries.


Two guns were recovered at the scene, Camden said. The man had a gun in his hand and inside his pocket.


Area South detectives are investigating.
