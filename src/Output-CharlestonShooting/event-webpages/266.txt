 A website featuring a 2,444-word white supremacist screed shows dozens of photos of the gunman arrested in the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre. 


 The site shows a stone-faced Dylann Roof — the man who confessed to shooting nine people dead at a Bible study group, according to sources — holding weapons, visiting a cemetery for Confederate soldiers, and burning and spitting on an American flag. 


 Roof appears to have bought the site domain in February based on a reverse domain look-up service that found it was registered under the name Dylann Roof, using Roof's mother's home address. NBC News could not confirm the site's authenticity or whether Roof was its creator.

 Federal law enforcement sources said the FBI and local Charleston authorities have been investigating and analyzing the site, and have known about it for several days. 


 While the FBI is not saying with "100 percent" certainty it belongs to Roof, they are operating under the assumption that he is responsible for all of the writings, photos and other material, sources said.

 There are also photos on it of historic sites, such as a Confederate museum, and one picture of a beach's coastline with "1488" carved in the sand, a white supremacy encryption that stands for: "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children." It's unclear who took many of the photos.

 In a drawn-out rant, the site's writer outlines becoming "racially aware," explaining that he wasn't raised in a racist environment, but was "awakened" by the case of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot to death in Florida.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (June 1, 2015) – A woman was fatally shot early Monday morning in the 1400 block of South East Street during an attempted robbery.
Mark Williams says he and his girlfriend, 33-year old Hilary Acton of Clayton, were were unloading a carload of clothing from Goodwill in the 1400 block of South East Street around 1:15 Monday morning.  He told police two unidentified men approached them and demanded the items from their car.  One of the suspects was armed with a handgun.
Williams says neither he nor Acton resisted the suspects, but one of them fired his weapon, hitting Hilary Acton multiple times.  He says he yelled to his brother for help and chased the robbers down the sidewalk.
“I saw his eyes and he was scared when he shot her,” said Williams. “Then they ran and they turned left, then turned around and started shooting at me again.”
Witnesses told police the two suspect ran south down East Street before cutting through a yard and escaping the area near Cottage Avenue.
Williams was not hit, but Acton died from multiple gunshot wounds to the upper body, according to police.
“From my understanding they did not get anything from our victims,” said IMPD Lt. Richard Riddle.  “So it was attempted robbery that unfortunately ended with someone’s life.”
Joel Russell works at a nearby pizza place and called 911.
“I was standing at the back door and heard about seven, eight gunshots go off and some ricochets and I went out and called the police,” said Russell. “Looked down the street, you heard a lady screaming to help the person and I stayed on the phone with 911 until the police came down the road.”
The woman’s parents arrived on the scene around 4 a.m. They spoke about the mother of two.
“She was caring, honest. She was really striving to be who she was supposed to be,” Williams said.  “She loved her kids. She just wanted a family and she just wanted a start at life that was meaningful.”
He continued, “This isn’t right and it’s not over either, so I guess if anybody knows anything, I would just ask you to do the right thing. She was amazing and that should have been me, period. They’re cowards. They just started shooting. They didn’t even try to take the stuff. What was the point of that? I don’t even know them.”
Police do not have any suspects in custody at this time.
Unlike most homicides that involve people who know each other, investigators say this case may truly be a random act of deadly violence.
“At this point in the investigation, we don’t have any information to believe that they were in fact targeted directly, or by any association or known association with our suspects,” Riddle said.
Riddle said several witnesses who were in the area have given investigators helpful information about the suspects.  Detectives were also working to gather surveillance video from a Village Pantry convenience store directly across the street.
Detectives urge anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at (317) 262-TIPS (8477). Callers may also text “INDYCS” plus tip information to 274637 (CRIMES).

 The writer goes on to explain his views on race, calling black people "stupid and violent," Jewish people an "enigma," Hispanic people a "huge problem," and East Asian people "by nature very racist."

 The writer then describes a disdain for the American flag, which he says represents "people pretending like they have something to be proud [of] while White people are being murdered daily in the streets." The writer concludes by saying that he has no choice but to fight, and says he has chosen Charleston because of its historical importance and because it "at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country." 
















"1488," a numerical symbol popular with white supremacists, is carved in the sand in a photo posted to a website registered under the name of Dylann Roof.
 






 Roof, 21, was arrested in the fatal shootings of the nine victims at the historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston on Wednesday night. Police say they believe the attack was a hate crime.
