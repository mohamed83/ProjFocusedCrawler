COLUMBIA, S.C.  — The man accused of slaying nine black church members in Charleston last month has been indicted on dozens of federal charges.




That word comes from a federal law enforcement official. According to the official, a federal grand jury indicted Dylann Roof on 33 federal charges.




 
Prosecutors haven’t said if they’ll seek the death penalty against Roof on state charges including nine counts of murder.




Roof’s state trial is set to begin July 11, 2016.
