Police: Suspect charged in Job Corps murder


 Matthew Carlock.


ST. LOUIS (KTVI) – The St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office charged a 20-year-old local man in the shooting death of a 21-year-old student at the St. Louis Job Corps Center in north city.
The shooting occurred Wednesday at 6 p.m. on the Job Corps campus, according to Schron Jackson, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.
The victim, identified as Matthew Anderson, was shot once in the chest while he lay in his dorm room bed and pronounced dead at the scene.
Jackson said investigators eventually identified and located their primary suspect, Matthew Carlock of University City. Carlock fled the area after the shooting but later surrendered to authorities. He was charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action. Bond was set at $1 million.
There’s no clear motive for the shooting, police said.
St. Louis Job Corps is a career training program administered by the U.S. Department of Labor for people ages 16 to 24.
Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.
