The person above is 
NOT the suspect
.  His name is Austin Rich, he was just wearing a similar looking outfit as the suspect.  He was questioned and released.  






So the guy that was taken in handcuffs was NOT the suspect. It was a local cameraman.

This is a tragedy! I’ve never understood the motivation behind all these wackos that feel the need to get some notoriety by killing others. I can’t help wondering how being detained and questioned will affect the life of that photographer who just happened to be wearing the wrong outfit!  It shouldn’t, but you know that tons of people will see him in handcuffs but not read far enough to see that he was released!  Here’s an interesting article about the pastor that was killed…

Maybe this has been discussed already. I haven’t caught up with the story here yet or all the comments on all threads. Just curious: Any crime scene photos yet? What about the report that 30 of the shooter’s 80-something friends on Facebook are black? Isn’t that curious for a racist?

And “his” name has been spelled three different ways that I’ve seen so far: Dylan, Dyllan, and this (most interesting) Dylann.  ANN?  He does look very effeminate. The small ankle in the large boots, and then the alleged comment about women being raped …
