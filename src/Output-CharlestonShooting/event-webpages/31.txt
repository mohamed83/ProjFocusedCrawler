(June 23, 2015) – Shelby Police released dash cam video from Dylann Roof’s arrest in North Carolina.
Roof is charged with killing nine people during a Bible study inside a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina last Wednesday.
He was identified in North Carolina by florist Debbie Dills, who recognized his car while driving to work.
Her boss called 9-1-1- while she followed Roof’s car for 30-miles, waiting for police to catch up.
When police caught up with Roof, police say he admitted who he was and surrendered without incident.
Officers also confiscated a semi-automatic handgun from the automobile.
