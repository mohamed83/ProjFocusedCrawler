	A 21-month-old boy picked up a loaded handgun and fatally shot himself in the torso in St. Louis County on Tuesday afternoon, police said.



	Investigators believe the toddler shot himself accidentally at around 1 p.m. at a home on Utica Dr. in the Hanley Hills area, St. Louis County Police Department spokesman Shawn McGuire said in a statement. The as-yet-unidentified boy was pronounced dead at St. Mary’s Hospital, police said.



	Police arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting, but no details on the arrest will be available until the case is presented to county prosecutors Wednesday morning, McGuire said.

A sign lamented gun violence outside the St. Louis County house where police say a toddler accidentally shot himself with a handgun on Tuesday afternoon.
 
 
 



	Hospital staff who tried to save the toddler’s life notified police in Richmond Heights, another village in St. Louis County, that the boy had suffered a gunshot wound, 
KSDK-TV reported
.



	Detectives with the county police department’s Crimes Against Persons Unit called the boy’s death accidental “after a thorough investigation,” McGuire said.

Police arrested a suspect in the shooting on Tuesday night, but no information about the arrest will be available until county prosecutors are presented with the case on Wednesday morning, police said.
 
 
 



	The shooting may be related to a drive-by earlier this month on the same block at a “known drug house,” one neighbor said in an interview 
with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch
.



	The boy’s mother is 24 years old and the toddler who died was her only child, a woman who identified herself as a relative of the family told the local newspaper.
 
 
 
2 year old shot and killed...I'm at a lost for words. This should be bothersome to us all. So sad. My thoughts and prayers.

	The shooting happened less than a week after a 9-year-old girl in Ferguson, Jamyla Bolden, was gunned down 
while she did her homework
 on her mother’s bed.

The 1856 British Guiana one-cent magenta is a tiny octagonal red inch-wide stamp. Philatelic experts say that when it is auctioned at Sotheby’s in New York on June 17, this singular postal artifact is expected to fetch something around $20 million, the largest price ever paid for a stamp. By weight and size, it may be the most valuable object in the world. The stamp is just one souvenir of the strange legacy of John E. du Pont, a man who had everything money could buy but threw it away in one moment of blind violence.
